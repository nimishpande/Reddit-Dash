      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hey all, \n\nSearched around this subreddit and online and couldn't find any good examples of this happening with oral minoxidil, but has anybody else gotten facial Pili Multigemini (compound hair growth) from oral minoxidil? I have relatively thick facial hair, and started oral minoxidil roughly a year ago at 2.5mg, once a day.  I haven't noticed these elsewhere on my body, just on my face. \n\n\n\nI used to get these compound hairs once every couple of months, but now I've been finding them after shaving 1-3x per week. They almost always end up becoming ingrown hairs/turning into zits if I don't pluck them, and I've been shaving with a Norelco OneBlade which generally doesn't leave any ingrown hairs/irritate my skin at all. I wash my face with a silicone scrubber in the shower (helps exfoliation), apply moisturizer 1x per day. At night I wash my face and apply 0.5% tretinoin cream 2-3x weekly. I've had this skincare routine for years, so nothing's really changed on that front. \n\n\n\nThese aren't particularly bad or anything, but I'm wondering if anybody has any advice on how to deal with them, or if they've also experienced dealing with these. Overall oral minox has been pretty good for me, I tried finasteride a few years ago, had some bad side effects, but aside from extra body hair/ear hair and these, no negative side effects on minoxidil. \n\n\n\n(Photo taken from elsewhere on Reddit, I never seem to remember to take a photo of these whenever I pull them).

This is odd, because there don't seem to definitive biomolecular reasons this should affect DHT production.\n\nStill, no studies exist that credibly study the relation between both. Which is why, if this gets enough interest, I &amp; some academic friends will be conducting the first large, credible study on Creatine &amp; DHT correlation next month.  \n  \nThis will be a basic 4-week double-blind study where you can take your own Creatine, or a free generic month's worth of supply provided by us. \n\nTo participate, please indicate interest below &amp; we'll get back to you! Why participate? If we can conclusively prove no effect, it'll mean you can get the same or better gains going to the gym much, much faster (22% in modern samples) &amp; maintain markers of brain health.\n\nCreatine is a well-studied, fantastic, beautifully harmless supplement.

I didnt notice this until about 9PM, and after taking a shower and my shampoo not washing it out, i turned to dawn dish soap, as other forums had suggested. I know that dawn is really harsh on your hair, but i figured it is just the bottom part of my hair, not anywhere near the scalp, so i decided it would probably be fine and any hair that got damaged would just grow out. But now im starting to wonder. I used a good amount of conditioner after i washed my hair with a small amount of dish soap, and it did get the oil out of my hair, but is this gonna leave some long lasting effects that are gonna bite me later on? For the record, i do not intend to use dish soap on my hair regularly and this was a one time, emergency type of thing.",

      "content": "Hello! I have thin ~3c curls (I think high porosity) that I’ve been struggling a lot with recently. I changed birth controls a couple years back, and I haven’t been to grow my hair as long since. It just seems so dry and unhappy. I haven’t had a haircut in about a year, so I’m worried I just need another trim. Sadly there is only one curly hairdresser where I live and she cuts my hair SO short whenever I go to her. \n\nThese photos were taken the day after a wash day after a full day of work. I’d really appreciate any thoughts on what my hair might need. Am I over-moisturizing? Not moisturizing enough? Using too many products? Any and all input is appreciated!!\n\nRoutine:\n- I shampoo with bounce curl gentle clarifying shampoo maybe 1x/week, and the Curlsmith scalp detox line 1x/month\n- I wet and condition my hair pretty much every day, and use random conditioners. Right now I think it’s the unbreakable bonds Ouidad one\n- after rinsing out conditioner flip hair over in the shower and add Ouidad vitacurl styling serum, then moisture lock whipped curls, then brush with a tangle teezer, then add some advanced climate control gel\n- flip my head upright, comb through with my fingers to create curls, flip over one more time, and wrap my hair in a microfiber towel for ~5 min\n- lastly I’ll add some I create hold gel using prayer hands, and sometimes clip my roots for lift \n- I sleep on a satin pillowcase with my hair in 2 loose twists/braids. I add jojoba oil and/or waleda rosemary conditioning oil at the ends of the braids for added moisturization\n- recently started using nutrifol scalp serum at night\n- refresh by mixing some water with I create hold in my hands, then glide it over my hair \n\nI’ve been in a Ouidad phase recently, which definitely has my hair feeling softer and happier. I was using Curlsmith fragrance free before, but the new formulations didn’t work as well for my curls \n",

      "content": "First pic is from about 7 months ago before I realized my hair might be wavy (sorry i dont have a more recent photo of the back). Today I tried some curly/wavy products. What do you guys think? I would love to hear any tips!! Particularly, is there a way I can get the back and the underneath to curl more? The underneath is still quite straight.\n\nHeres the routine I used today:\n1. \nShampoo: this time I used Kristin Ess dear clean clarifying shampoo to clarify, but in the future I will just use that one once a month and use V&amp;co wave enhancing shampoo the rest of the time. \n\nConditioner: V&amp;co wave enhancing conditioner\n\n2.\nLeave in conditioner: curl talk leave in conditioner \n\nCream: curl talk defining cream\n\nGel: curl talk defining gel\n\n3. \nI diffused it, but im not sure i did it right. I'd love tips!!\n\n4.\nI applied all the products with my head forward and my hair over the top and scrunched them in. But I wasnt fully upside down, so maybe that was wrong?\n\nI usually wash my hair about once a week but im gonna start doing every 5 days instead because it gets a bit greasy on top around day 4 or 5\n\nI sleep on a satin pillowcase because im trying to grow my hair long and I heard it helps\n\nRecently, especially around my crown, my hair started getting incredibly frizzy, which led me to try seeing if it actually wanted to be wavy :)\n\nWhat hair type wavy do you guys think i have? Im thinking maybe 2a ?\n\nAlso, what do I do now to keep it good until my next wash day? How do I keep it not tangled with out brushing it? Send help !\n",
