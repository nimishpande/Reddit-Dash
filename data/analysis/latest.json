      "content": "I’ve been using the Dot &amp; Key Vitamin C + SPF 50 sunscreen for a month straight. I bought it after seeing all the ads and I regretted it for a sec much since everyone bashed it but honestly, here is my hot take based just on my experience: \n\nPros: Leaves no white cast on my face. I layer it with a Serum, Moisturizer and then sunscreen but it hardly feels oily (maybe cuz I have dull skin). The texture feels good on the skin and mixes well. Feels very light. I hate the feeling of being plastered when I apply sunscreen so this felt good for a change.\n\nCons: Everyone keeps saying the SPF protection is not as good. I personally didn’t feel that way, since my face didn’t get any darker. It did give it a subtle suppleness, and i am getting no unwanted tan yet either. \n\nI think i’m gonna stick with it irrespective of what i might hear, if something works for you- it works! It is what it is. \n",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I would love your help/opinions on what you suggest she changes in her current routine and I'll purchase the recommendations as a physical present- along with the new routine guidance!\n\nHer routine now is just at night, because mornings are a little hectic to sneak in a routine. Her current routine has her face showing redness- and she has the goal of going makeup-free more often which the redness stops her from doing. Plus she thinks the routine could just be better.\n\nHer current routine (see list or the meme):  \n\\- Neutrogena oil free acne wash  \n\\- PCA skin hydrating toner  \n\\- Timeless 20% vitamin c ferulic acid vitamin e  \n\\- cos de baha AZ serum  \n\\- neutrogena hydro boost water cream+ lotion\n\nOne catch is that she's currently breastfeeding our 6 month old- so whatever routine needs to be breastfeeding friendly.\n\nAny insight would be helpful! There's a million routines online and I can't tell which are just marketing slop or which are useful / any better than her current one. I'm seeing retinol as a suggestion but also seeing lots of backlash to it too.",

Still, I’d love suggestions I can actually find here too.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n- Help understanding my porosity\n- A simple routine suggestion\n- Recommendations for a good leave-in and curl cream (priority!)\n- Any other product ideas that could help with dryness/frizz\n\nWhat I currently use:\n\nMielle Rosemary Mint (as a clarifying once every one to 2 weeks) + Aussie Miracle Moist shampoos, Aussie deep hydration conditioner, Lush Super Milk (Leave in spray), Garnier Banana Hair Food (kinda as a leave in/curl cream), ECO Gel, some oils (Amla, Castor), and Aussie heat protectant before diffusing.\n\nWhat I want to try next:\n\nThinking of buying the SheaMoisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Mask for deep hydration. If you’ve used it on hair like mine, please tell me if it’s worth it!\n\nMy main issues: very dry, frizzy, moisture-sucking curls that don’t hold definition well.\n\nThank you so much for any help 💛\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I’m not sure of my curl type and porosity and I need help building a routine.

I’m getting married soon and could really use help from the curly community (or anyone who’s DIY’d their wedding hair).\n\nI’ve attached a photo of my natural hair for reference. \n\nI know for sure that I want to wear my hair curly, but I'd love for it to look a little bit different than it does every other day. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to find a curly hair stylist near me, so I’m hoping to DIY my looks.\n\nI’m aiming for three different styles across events:\n1) A loose, romantic bun (if it’s possible with my length)\n2) A half-up half-down style\n3) A natural curls-down look that can survive hours of dancing \n\nWhat I'm struggling with is that most tutorials I’m finding are either for much longer curls or assume I already know what I’m doing, which I do not. \n\nSo I’m looking for:\n- Beginner friendly curly hair updo tutorials (if it says twist the front sections back, I would love to know how to actually do that without looking like a mess)\n- Tips or hacks for short-to-medium curly hair\n- Products for strong hold (happy to use non-CG hairspray if needed)\n\nMy other big concern is if I use strong hold hairspray/gel for the bun or half-up style earlier, will that ruin definition for the final curls-down day? Or is there a way to reset without fully washing again?\n\nAny advice, product recs, easy step-by-step guides, or “don’t make the mistake I did” stories are very appreciated!\n\nThank you from a stressed out but determined bride-to-be ✨ \n\nRoutine: \nI wash with a generic shampoo and the Cantu shea butter conditioner a couple of times a week (endurance sports + swimming). I then use the Asbha leave in conditioner and gel when wet, scrunch with a tshirt, lightly diffuse and then allow to air dry completely. Apart from this, I use satin pillowcases protect my hair while sleeping.",

It tends to disappear after a minute, but if it’s a day where I’ve been smiling a lot it can take up until the next morning for it to disappear. Maybe it’s only on one side of my face from sleeping more on that side? Or from having a bit of a crooked smile? Not sure\n\nI’m pretty new to skin care so not really sure what I’m doing. My routine right now is perhaps minimal - I use a moisturizer at night, one in the morning with a korean SPF, and I’ve started a retinal.\n\nI’m really scared of it quickly becoming a deep permanent line. Am I aging too fast? I definitely have fair skin that burned a lot in my youth, wearing daily SPF wasn’t a thing I knew to do until the past year 😭 RIP\n\nAny advice appreciated! \n",

The skin in that area looks uneven and slightly irritated, especially after shaving. When I shave, the bumps and dark dots become even more visible. It does not usually hurt, but the skin looks damaged, patchy, and not smooth like the rest of my face. I am not sure what the exact issue is. It could be ingrown hairs, razor bumps, shaving irritation, pigmentation, or marks left from old acne. The area feels like it has a lot of tiny clogged pores or trapped hair roots. I want to understand what this condition actually is so I can fix it properly. If anyone has had something similar or knows what this might be, please tell me. I mainly want to know if this is related to shaving or something like folliculitis or scarring. I do not want to use the wrong products or make it worse by shaving incorrectly. Any advice or explanation about what this issue is and how to treat it would be very helpful.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

In the last two months, I lost my 3 year old dog unexpectedly to cancer, I was discriminated, harassed, and retaliated against at my job and then fired for reporting it. They are fighting my unemployment and I am broke. A week after I lost my job, my grandmother passed away. I live 3,000 miles away and could not be there. And then a week ago my ten year old dog passed away. I did not realize it but I didn’t bathe for a week maybe two repeatedly. I only brush my hair after I get out of the shower because it is curly. So, my hair is incredibly matted and I am so embarrassed. I can’t bring myself to go to a hairdresser and endure judgement. This has never happened but I also have never experienced such grief and neglected myself. I have long hair halfway down my back and one section is so matted it goes up to my skull. I always wear my hair up and did not realize it until I showered last night. I have nexus conditioner and detangler. I am going to try that but does anyone have any advice? And please, I beg you to be kind. I’m not strong right now. Thank you.",

I’m very new at this so I’m not even sure what type of hair I have in terms of curl pattern. Is there a different haircut that I could maybe try? I feel a little meh about the whole thinning/thin thing because my hair i hold very near and dear to my heart. I included photos of my hair in 2023 because I feel like it was much thicker then. I did not use any products at the time nor was I focused on hair care like that sadly. \n\nI was overexercising for a hot second there (about 3-4 months) without proper nutrition which is when I noticed a ton of shedding/loss. I’ve been eating normally and back on track for about 7 months now. I put my routine below in order of how I do it! The photos I have here I blow dried with an adapter because of the cold weather,  which I don’t typically do. I usually let it air dry after I put the products in.

I'm so over these pale raccoon marks around my eyes and the redness around my nose and cheeks. :(\n\n**Worth knowing:**\n\n* The 'sunglasses tan' around my eyes has stuck around for almost a full year since my friends and I did our annual winter weekend campout across the frozen Boundary Waters. *Conditions: Full sun, temperature well below zero plus windchill.* I was stubborn and didn't cover my face, apart from sunglasses (yes, I know; hand me the dunce cap) on the days we traversed to and from our campsite. It gets sweaty, hauling gear under all the proper layers! \n   * In an effort to even this out in the warmer months that followed, I wore a big hat instead of sunglasses. No dice. \n   * What I find especially strange is that the redness seems to ramp up on overcast (not sunny) days that I spend outside. \n* Weekly use of woodburning sauna. I will be heartbroken if I have to give this up...\n* I saw my dermatologist over the summer for my annual skin screening. I mentioned my concerns about redness. She suggested I add [Differin Adapalene Gel Retinoid Treatment](https://differin.com/shop/differin-gel/3029949.html) but I haven't stuck with it because even a 1x/weekly application seems to make my skin that much more red and sensitive to sun. :( She also asked if I wanted to explore Laser Genesis.

I have decided I won't be ever using it again. \n\nI've been off fin for about 7 months and during that time i thought i was basically out of options and have pretty much just been trying to enjoy the time i have with the hair I have left while mentally preparing for shaving. \n\nAll the recent talk of PP405 and Breezula etc got me a bit excited and i realised that while we have no idea whether something promising will come out soon, it could actually be really beneficial for me to try and hold on as best i can for a couple of years. \n\nThe past few days i've been looking into drugs like Breezula which lead me into looking at RU58841 which lead me to look at other topical anti androgens on the market. \n\nFluridil seems like a really promising option that i could look into. I'm not even suggesting that it needs to be a replacement for fin, but since fin isn't an option to me, it looks like something definitely worth trying. \n\nHow come meds like this aren't talked about more? Do you think it's worth trying? it sounds like the safety profile is really good, even if the effects aren't super strong. The only negative is the price. I'm in the UK and it looks like i'll have to buy it from Germany and it works out to about £55 for a months supply. \n\nJust wanted to know your thoughts on if it's worth it, whether you've used it before, any tips, advice on where to get it, how to apply it etc. \n\nCheers!\n\n",

      "title": "[Hair Removal] [B+A] 3 month progress with chronic ingrowns and scarring from them + what I’ve done differently",
      "content": "People brought up my legs a lot. I was embarrassed to wear shorts or swimsuits. My mom had the same problem and used laser hair removal (which is what my derm recommended), but it was out of budget for me. She also still struggles with ingrowns and the scars that follow, so I told her what I’ve been doing, and she’s also had success with it. People have even pointed out how much better my legs look recently. Here’s what I’ve been doing if anyone else has this problem and looking for potential solutions:\n\nDISCLAIMER: I would not use a lot of the products I’m going to mention around the vulva. If you struggle with ingrowns and irritation when shaving down there, I would talk to your doctor about an effective strategy that is safe for that area. \n\n- I stopped picking at them. This is the BIGGEST tip. I know everyone says this, and it’s definitely a lot easier said than done, but it’s given my skin time to heal and prevented further infections/scarring. Instead of picking, find a drawing salve. Apply a generous amount to the ingrown and cover with a bandaid. Repeat daily until the ingrown is pulled out. Be warned: it has a very…odd smell. \n\n- In the beginning, I only shaved once a week. I now shave twice a week. I think that, with time, I’ll be able to shave more frequently, but I’m taking my time to be sure my skin heals, which means I’m not trying to “overdo” anything in the interim. \n\n- I made the switch to a single blade safety razor. A lot of multi blade razors actually cut the hair shorter than the skins surface. The safety razor is very sharp, and the design allows the hair to be cut at the skins surface while still delivering a smooth, close shave. I change the blade regularly (every couple shaves) and don’t store it in the shower. It has also saved me a lot of money, which is a nice bonus. It definitely takes some getting used to. TAKE YOUR TIME WITH IT!!! Don’t not try to do a quick shave with it. I snagged my ankle twice before I learned that lesson. \n\n- I use a kessa exfoliating mitt the day before I shave. I also use laundry sanitizer for it and washcloths to prevent bacterial growth as much as possible. It’s pretty aggressive, so I don’t use it more than once or twice a week. If I shaved more frequently, I still don’t think I would use it more than I am now. I use a chemically exfoliating body wash daily (which I elaborate on further in the next section) to prevent unnecessary irritation to the skin. \n\n- Hibiclens!!! I wash my legs with it twice before shaving and allow it to sit for a bit. Has helped prevent razor burn and ingrowns. It’s also super cheap. I also switched to a glycolic + lactic acid body wash that I use every shower, which has helped tremendously with skin roughness and bumpiness (exfoliation and moisturizing is the name of the game for people who struggle with ingrowns bc it’s caused by the hair getting trapped under the skin; this is a big reason my mother and I struggle so much with it bc we both have kp).\n\n- the ultra gentle Billie shave cream is my fav. You need something that provides a lot of cushion and moisture. Aveno also has a lovely shave cream if you’re looking for a cheaper option.  \n\n-  I’ve tried moisturizers for KP, but they irritated my skin. The lotions would also pill up if there was any sort of friction, even just from tighter pants. I couldn’t even itch a bug bite! Because of this, I took a different approach. After I shower most days, I use a lotion with retinol. I’ve found it has helped with my skins texture but also has helped some with scarring. On mornings and days where I shave, I use vanicream (I also love it for my face). Fragrance free, very moisturizing, non-irritating. Also, note that I said mornings! It helps a lot to keep your skin regularly moisturized so the hair has an easier time passing the skin. \n",
