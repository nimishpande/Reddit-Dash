      "title": "Updated curly hair routine, in the hopes it will help someone! Can be found under the photo",
      "content": "Hello hello! If you're here then I'm assuming you've come to look for my hair routine and what I do to get results like these, and you've come to the right place!! It's taken me over a year to figure out how to look after my hair because I'm the only one in my family with curly hair, but thanks to my lovely friends and tiktok of course, I've been able to get better at doing it! I've got a long way to go to find what works for me but here is my latest curl routine.\n\n1. I start by wetting my hair in the shower. Then I detangle. I only ever do it when it's wet and as soon as I'm able to run a brush through my hair without it catching, that's when I know I'm good! \n\n2. I then double shampoo, the first time being to get rid of any gunk or whatever on my hair, the second time to actually clean my hair properly. The first time, I use head and shoulders because that's what my dad buys and it cleans my scalp nicely, and the second time, I go in with a hydrating shampoo. Currently I'm using the one by Phyto. \n\n3. I go in with some Sukin Hydrating Conditioner.Thiw is an Australian brand so you may not have it where you are, but I find this works for me really well. If not though any old hydrating conditioner will do. \n\n4. Depending on how dry my hair feels, I sometimes go in with a bit of a hair mask by Tsubaki. I'm not really sure which one or where to get that because it was a random one my mum didn't want and have me but as with all my other products and things I use, any old hair mask will do! \n\n5. Sometimes I like to use a Denman brush to brush style in the shower. I do this and then make sure I don't disturb the curl clumps before I get out of the shower. Recently though I've taken to using a dupe of the Bounce curl brush that I found at City Beach for $10. If you decide to use that, it can be done in or out the shower, but if out the shower, it should be done after resetting and applying leave in and curl cream. \n\n6. After getting out of the shower, I use a bit of Garnier Aloe Vera leave in conditioner. I don't like to use too much because I don't like when my hair feels product heavy but feel free to experiment with how much you need! \n\n7. Then, curl cream. I like the one by Hask. I only ever use the teeniest tiniest amount to again prevent my hair being product heavy, we're talking a literal smudge for each section of hair. I don't always section but if I do, then it's into top and bottom and left and right. if not though I just use a slightly bigger smudge of curl cream and add it into my hair \n\n8. I plop my hair in a t shirt until it's 50% dry. I don't own a diffuser and don't intend to get one because I don't like the idea of heat damage, but I do fine without one anyway! Plopping helps my hair hold its shape a bit before I add gel to set it \n\n9. After plopping, I go in with gel. I use a decent amount on each side because of course I've taken my hair out of its sections and it's just left and right, and I'd describe it as how much you'd put if the gel were moisturiser for your face if that makes sense? And I never rake it through. I use praying hands and then scrunch my hair to really get it in there. Lately I've been using the one by Umberto Giannini but I also love the one by Cake! It smells absolutely delicious \n\n10. I leave my hair to air dry and then I'm done! I try to avoid touching it as much as possible. Then once it's dry I scrunch out the gel cast with my hands and separate any huge curl clumps. And that's all! I typically wash my hair every four days because I can't stand leaving it any longer but it lasts me well provided I take the time to do a good job\n\nI hope this helps someone here!! Any questions feel free to ask me!! ",

      "content": "Hi everybody,\n\n\n\nI don't know if I'm in the appropriate sub. I tried to find info about this topic but I found very old posts, so I though I could ask it again.\n\n\n\nAs the title says, I'm 27F from Spain and I'm starting to notice my elevens getting worse as time goes by. Right now they're not very visible because I've applied moisturizer, but when my skin is drier or when I use my forehead muscles (so most of the time), they become more visible. It's like my skin is not flexible at all.\n\n\n\nTbh, I feel like I use those eyebrow muscles unconsciously. I wish I could avoid this. I'm not really troubled or stressed, but I tend to do it when I concentrate on a task (which, to be fair, I think is most of the time lol).\n\n\n\nI wanted to ask you for advice. What has helped you personally to reduce your elevens? **Not just skincare**: did you find a way to stop frowning unconsciously? do you eat some vitamins/food that helps you with that? Btw, I would like to avoid botox / invasive procedures as much as possible, as I'm not an expert in that and I would be scared of the consequences (tbh, I don't really like the results in most cases, but this may be due to prejudices...).\n\n\n\nThis is my current skincare routine FYI. Very minimalist in order to be constant.\n\n**\\[Morning\\]**\n\n* No cleanser lately as my skin feels dry. Also because of the cold temperatures lmao.\n* **Super C Serum** Niche Beauty Lab.\n* (When I don't use Vitamin C serum, I use **Niacinamide Glow Cream** by Niche Beauty Lab.)\n* **Moisturizer** SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella.\n* **Sunscreen** SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella. I work from home, so I only use it when I go out.\n\n**\\[Night\\]**\n\n* **Cleanser** Effaclar La Roche-Posay. I'm thinking it may be to strong for my skin, as my skin feels dry after using it.\n* **Clinical Vitamin A** Niche Beauty Lab. This has 0,3% Retinol and 0,1% Retinal, apparently.\n\n  \nThanks to all in advance!!!",

I’m no stranger to whiteheads and sebaceous filaments and i can usually get them under control, but this amount with this much frequency is new. Every day there is a new pimple. I’ll put a pimple patch on before bed and wake up and they’re gone, but then later that night they’re back, sometimes reoccurring in the same problem spots or creating new problem spots. \n\nI have oily/combo skin. I’m not new to skincare and i have kept the same routine pretty consistently for the last few years with small tweaks here and there where needed. I used to have great skin and now it’s just…. This.\n\nI am currently dealing with some major life stressors but idk if that could contribute? \n\nMorning: \n\nCerave sa cleanser\n\nCosrx blackhead toner (every second day, mostly nose + chin)\n\nCosrx galactomyces 95\n\nSkin1004 bakuchiol eye cream\n\nAnua rice glow milky toner\n\nBeauty of joseon relief sun aqua fresh\n\nNight:\n\nCerave sa cleanser\n\nCosrx blackhead toner\n\nCosrx galactomyces 95\n\nHada labo hyaluronic acid \n\nSome by mi retinol eye cream\n\nCerave blemish control resurfacing retinol serum\n\nDr althea 345 relief cream\n\nIs it hormonal?

I developed them by negligently pressuring or pressing them onto a laptop and table cloth back then. The marks or uneven skin tone have not faded much up to now. This was more than 10 years ago. I saw a reputable dermatologist in NYC this week and I was prescribed a retinol cream while being recommended Fraxel/Derma V in case the cream AND chemical peel (another recommended treatment) don’t work or resolve the problems.  I’m nervous and hesitant about the lasers because I’ve been hearing stories from people about how lasers can potentially do more damage to the skin (dermal scarring, for example) and contribute to fat loss (something that’s also hard to resolve). Are there side effects or potential complications from chemical peels too? Are VIPeels any better than chemical peels? \n\nThanks",

It would also be great if anyone has an idea of what hair type I have (I believe is either 2a or 2b but I'm not sure). The photo attached is my hair still wet after doing a quick routine that I'll explain below.\n\nI grew up thinking my hair was pin straight (I also straightened it and bleached it a lot which might not have helped with me seeing my actual texture), which in retrospective seems kinda silly since most of my family has either curly or wavy hair and mine was also frizzy when not straightened but would somehow look wavy and not frizzy at all when on vacation while using hotel shampoos (seriously what's on that thing xD). \n\nI currently shampoo first with H&amp;S and second with a Carbamide shampoo from Matas (danish drugstore) and then use Aussie's 3 Minute Miracle Deep Hydration Conditioner on the ends. After I get out I use a Mata's Curly Leave in Hair Mask and also Mata's Curly Mousse (didn't want to go for a gel or cream cause I've read it can weight down wavy hair) and blot with a microfibre towel. I currently air dry since I'm still looking for a diffuser that fits my air wand. And I am trying to get into the habit of wearing my bonnet to bed.\n\nI can see that the pattern holds a bit better on the non-bleached strands/parts of my hair so hopefully it'll be better once my hair grows a bit and I cut the bleached parts.\n\nThank you in advance to everyone! &lt;3",

I just don’t want to get it wrong or it doesn’t look good. It’s too a point I’m almost scared to get it cut incase the stylist things it looks horrible or something. I am coming from a position who is trying to fix their hair quality after years of bad hair care and unhealthy life choices. \n\nAnyways I’m wondering can anyone suggest a hair cut or shape that might look good? My routine at the moment is i use Nioxin Shampoo and Conditioner scalp recovery as I’ve struggled with dry scalp for most of my life and that caused a little bit of hairline loss. I shampoo once or twice a week. Condition 2-3 days a week. Any more than this I find my hair becomes dry. Recently started styling it a bit like this now that’s it’s longer. I air dry my hair except for taking a bit of water off my hair with a towel.\n\nI don’t use any styling product really but what I have noticed is that my hair looks best after washing, home from gym (which the photos are after) and in light the curls look decent but without light they look so flat?",

Cleansing: Previously Based Bodyworks shampoo and Bouclème Hydrating Shampoo/Conditioner (full scalp/length application).\n\n2.  Other products: Bouclème styling gel/cream (applied to soaking wet hair via praying hands + \n\nscrunch).\n\n3.  Drying: Air-dried only (no diffusing/heat).\n\n4.  Other notes: Trying a modified Curly Girl approach but struggling with oiliness, buildup, and curl consistency. No consistent bonnet/silk pillowcase use.\n\nHas anyone found evidence-based or well-tolerated natural-ish products/routines for curly hair that provide good moisture without heaviness, maintain strong curl pattern, minimize buildup, and have neutral/mild scents? Please share what worked for you (products, brands, application tips). Thank you!",
