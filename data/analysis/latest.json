      "title": "Garnier Honey Water is amazing?!?",
      "content": "Over the past year I’ve been dabbling with sulphates and silicones again after YEARS of strict CGM. My scalp had terrible buildup, and my hair always felt weighed down and not so nice. I first started by using the Garnier Honey Treasures line and was amazed! My hair was so shiny, soft, and bouncy again. However, I was still wary of buildup and other issues with using silicones again, so I’d only use it every now and then.\n\nAfter a while I wanted to try and use more natural products again, not because I was struggling with my hair (it was still so nice!), but because I was so attached to CGM. I felt weird about using the “bad” ingredients even though they were working just fine.\n\nAfter focusing on CGM approved products again, I noticed I was having a rough time with my shampoos. My roots would feel extremely stripped. They felt dry and stiff even under the running water. I found this so confusing as I thought I was using “gentle” sulphate free products. (I tried Renpure, Pantene, AG care, Design Me, some Herbal Essences, Kitsch shampoo bars, etc. All sulphate free).\n\nI figured a shampoo with sulphates was only going to make that problem worse as they’re supposedly much more harsh. However, I decided to give Garnier another try, this time with the Honey Water line.\nAnd WOW. The shampoo only contains one sulphate (I think?) and it felt so amazing while I washed my hair. It didn’t feel stripped at all. It felt moisturized! And the lather was amazing too!\n\nCompared to Honey Treasures, the Honey Water conditioner does not contain silicones, yet the slip was the same if not better. It has a lovely thickness to it and felt so nice in my hair. And what’s more, the matching leave in cream has no silicones either! I used all three and my hair feels incredible. Soft, shiny, and bouncy all over again. Even though the shampoo isn’t strictly CGM due to the sulphates, I like that the rest of the formula is silicone free. \n\nAnyways, just wanted to share this. I’ve been spending lots of money over time trying so many products… and sometimes it really is just that cheap drug store combo that makes your hair pop.\n\nRoutine\n\n1. Shampoo: Garnier Whole Blends Honey Water Shampoo\n\n2. Conditioner: Garnier Whole Blends Honey Water Conditioner\n\n3. Leave-in: Garnier Whole Blends Honey Water Leave-in Cream\n\n4. Gel: Innersense I Create Hold\n\nBefore getting out of the shower, I run my hair under the water and immediately put in the leave-in so it’s as wet as possible. I get out of the shower, then I rake in the Innersense gel and scrunch. I’ll also spritz more water in my hair to get that good squishy sound when I scrunch. Then I finish off by diffusing.\n",

No wonder my face was constantly inflamed.\n\nSo I completely simplified my routine: a gentle cleanser, a fragrance-free moisturizer, and something soothing at night. It was the only thing that felt instantly calming without any sting, and I just stuck with it because it kept the redness down.\n\nIt's been around three months now no cysts, no painful flare-ups, nothing. My skin actually feels normal for the first time in years. Even during my period, not a single breakout. I'm honestly mad it took me this long to realize my skin just needed to be treated gently.\n\nThe best part? My texture's smoother and makeup sits better too.

I'll jump straight to the point. \n\nThe area around my mouth and my lips are getting incessantly drier every day. It's red and so dry, that i started having small sand-granule like blisters (that ooze puss). The skin is also burning to the point - talking or eating is becoming a task. Google Image search says it's herpes simplex.\n\nI am also having acne all over my face. My skin is sensitive, on the dry side. The acne flare up is the worst i have seen my face go through. Bangalore water is not helping as my hair is also falling in clumps. \n\nDoes anyone know a good dermatologist in bangalore? Can you please recommend someone? Probably someone who doesn't offer cosmetic procedures but genuine medicines/tests/diagnoses.\n\nFor context, i did go to 2 dermats 4/5 years back in kolkata and both of them on different occasions (mostly for the same issues, but this time it's the worst) recommended VERY expensive medicines that didn't show any consistent long term results. If any one can suggest any good pharmacy moisturizer/cream/anti-fungal/anti-viral, that might help too till i see the dermat, that will be kind! I know i need to do blood tests but i don't know which ones &amp; a dermat might help. So i want someone not recommending expensive medicines &amp; treatments ( i also do not simply have the money, i am paying off my student debt and i cannot afford to spend too much money on my skin, but i am asking because i am in a lot of pain). \n\nPLEASE help.

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

After conditioner has been in hair for a few minutes, I brush out the knots in the shower with conditioner still in.\n\nRinse out conditioner and keep hair pretty wet. Flip hair upside down and Spray hair with leave in and brush again. \n\nPrayer hands in some mousse and then scrunch with hands.

I wanted her to tone my orange ends at the bottom so that they match my natural hair color, but the ends at the bottom have become much darker (almost black), while the upper area is normal. My hair is very porous due to old blondings and keratin treatments. Unfortunately, that wasn’t taken into account (e.g., no shorter exposure time or primer), and now I have to try to save it at home with clarifying shampoo.\nHas anyone had similar experiences? Tips on how to fix it best? The hairdresser would also help me, but I’m afraid—I don’t know if you can use vitamin C at home to remove it or if it will become patchy then, or color pull at the hairdresser help 😭😭😭😭",

Please see the attached photos.\n\nTL;DR: 25 y/o in hot, sometimes humid Middle East country; combo-oily T-zone. New stressful job. Used to do a simple routine with OK results. Past month: a lot of acne on my forehead + visible pores on nose / ears. Wondering if flaky scalp / dandruff might be relevant. \n\nFor context: I’m 25 years old and currently living in a hot, sometimes humid country (Middle East region). I recently started a new, stressful, and demanding job. My skin is combination to oily, especially in the T-zone. I’ve always known this and used to keep a simple routine: a foaming cleanser, two serums (hyaluronic acid and niacinamide from The Ordinary), and a moisturizer from The Ordinary. I still had some minor issues, but overall my skin was fine.\n\nOver the past month, though, I’ve developed several problems on my forehead and surrounding areas. You can also see enlarged pores on my nose and ears (the photos were taken after a shower).\n\nRecently, I’ve been using a tea tree oil foam cleanser from a Korean brand called Orjena and the same moisturizer from The Ordinary. I repurchased niacinamide thinking it might help with the irritation, but it doesn’t seem to work — possibly even making things worse. Maybe my routine isn’t right for me anymore?\n\nToday, I bought the CeraVe Foaming Cleanser and Neutrogena Water Gel to try instead. I stopped using niacinamide and The Ordinary moisturizer yesterday.\n\nIt might also be relevant that I’ve had a flaky scalp and dandruff for many years, and I’m starting to wonder if that could be affecting my facial skin. \n\nI’m honestly not sure — this whole thing makes me very self-conscious, and seeing my skin like this really affects me emotionally.",
