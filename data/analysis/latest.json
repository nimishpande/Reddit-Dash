      "content": "Started my natural hair texture journey like a month ago. Every day is a different look—volume/definition/softness/shininess—it all differs! I just wanted to share my like day 3-4 hair maybe! I know the curls are not defined on this specific day of my hair wash schedule by any means, and I have not perfected my refresh routine, but I want to say that I really dig voluminous hair looks. I want to look like a 🦁 haha! \n\nRoutine: Wash with Mielle rosemary shampoo and random generic Pantene conditioner. \n\nIn really wet hair, rake either Mixed Chicks Curl Sculptor thinned out with water and Aussie gel on top and scrunch. Try to comb crown of head backwards/horizontally and apply those products and scrunch for more volume. Avoid middle part as much as you can. Then, for this look in particular I guess: mix just a little bit of the The Doux Texture mousse/foam, The Doux Honey mousse/foam, Herbal Essences mousse, John Frieda mousse, and Dollar Tree Spa Luxury extra hold mousse. I mix them all together and rake from roots to end and then diffuse however I want, especially upside down for more volume. \n\nAnd then I actually ended up putting my hair in a curly bun with a side part. And the next day after when I took it down, I retouched/rewet my hair leave in conditioner from Dollar Tree and put some The Doux texture mousse around face framing and Dollar Tree coconut hair oil and CHI hair oil and hairsprayed with some Aussie hair spray for hold!\n\nMedia: 1) Hair down after refresh 2) Curly bun with side part before hair refresh day (ignore crusty ass makeup hehe)",

      "content": "34M from New York here. I had my first HT back in Jan 2020 in Istanbul with Dr. Ziya Yavuz, right before COVID. My brother went with me and got his done too. Long story short… neither of us were happy with the results.\n\nFor me, the hairline was the biggest issue. Double grafts right up front, weird/unnatural shape, and overall low density on the scalp and crown. I’ve probably had some additional loss over the years, but even from day one it never really looked right.\n\nAfter sitting on it for a long time, someone on Reddit suggested I talk to Dr. Abhinav Kumar. He used to work with Eugenix and now has his own clinic in Patna, India. I was honestly skeptical at first, but after my first phone call with him, I felt way more comfortable than I ever did with my Turkey consult.\n\nI spent two days on the procedure. Before starting, he did a very detailed planning session with me — hairline design, density goals, expectations, all of it. What really stood out was that he personally did all the extractions and incisions himself. No tech-run surgery like my first experience.\n\nI ended up getting about 2,600 FUE grafts. He also used a few grafts to fix an old eyebrow scar I’ve had since childhood, which I didn’t even expect much from — but two days in, it already looks insanely natural.\n\nCost-wise, it came out to around $1,350 USD total, including the OR fee. That wasn’t my main reason for choosing him, but I won’t lie — it was a nice bonus.\n\nObviously it’s super early and I know final results take time, but for the first time since my 2020 transplant, I actually feel optimistic. I’ll post updates as things progress. Just wanted to share in case it helps someone who’s been burned before.",

As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "My skin is very oily and sensitive and also doesn’t absorb products well. I finally figured out some stuff that works for me with my skincare routine but would really like suggestions on laser treatments, I’m not concerned with cost I just want to know what the best type of treatment would be! For small scares and anti aging.. it looks way worse in the picture because the sun was in my eyes but I really hate the lines I’m getting in between my eyebrows and I really don’t want to do botox. I am using massage techniques and face yoga to try to help with it but wondering if laser can help too?\n\nNight time routine: \ncleansing balm (if i’m taking off makeup) followed by Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser. Then I layer my products first a retinol serum, then hyaluronic acid on top of that I use a night cream. About once a week or every other week, I use the ordinary AHA peel and I make sure to stop the retinol prior. \n\nMorning:\nI sometimes just use water on my face especially in the winter but in the summer I often use the Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser if i’m more oily. For products I use Good Molecules Azelaic acid then either hyaluronic acid or Vanicream daily facial moisturizer on top. \n\n",

My skin feels tight and itchy after cleansing, but later in the day it develops an oily film. What I was really hoping for was guidance on how to manage or reduce that oiliness, especially since it seems connected to dryness.\n\nWhen seborrheic dermatitis was mentioned, I told him I’ve already tried antifungal treatments before and they didn’t help. Despite that, I was prescribed an antifungal wash anyway, which left me feeling dismissed.\n\nI do understand how this may have happened - my skin is complicated, and post-Accutane issues aren’t always straightforward. It’s possible the doctor didn’t fully grasp the full picture in a short visit.\n\nHas anyone else left a dermatology appointment feeling unheard or brushed off? How did you handle it?",

For reference, my hair type: oily scalp, dry ends, I wash daily, and I’m currently growing out old dyed ends.\n\nMy current favourites:\n\nShampoos\n\n1.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Dove Cucumber &amp; Moisture\n2.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Garnier Pure Clean\n3.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Garnier Whole Blends Honey Water (not my main, but I really liked it when I used it)\n4.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Head &amp; Shoulders Tea Tree\n5.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Pantene Volume (for clarifying)\n\n(I mostly rotate between Dove Cucumber and Garnier Pure Clean for regular washes. I use Head &amp; Shoulders about once a week for scalp health, and Pantene Volume whenever I need a deeper cleanse.)\n\nConditioners / Masks / Bond Repair\n\n1.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Pantene Miracle Rescue Deep Conditioner (main conditioner right now while I grow out the dyed ends)\n2.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Dove Intensive Repair Mask (after Head &amp; Shoulders or clarifying shampoos)\n3.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠OGX Bond Protein Repair Pre-Wash (I use this 2–3 times a month, after shampoo)\n\nLeave-ins\n\n1.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Tresemmé Lamellar Gloss Cream Serum\n2.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Pantene Miracle Rescue Keratin Leave-In Repair Treatment (pump bottle, not the spray)\n3.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠L’Oréal Extraordinary Oil (used after leave-in)\n\n(I use the Tresemmé more often, but both leave-ins are very good.)\n\nOils\n\nNot drugstore, but oils have helped my hair so much. I use jojoba oil on my ends nightly. On days when I clarify or use Head &amp; Shoulders, I’ll use coconut oil or Vatika oils (argan or black seed) on the ends. For my scalp, I mostly stick to jojoba oil, and I do daily scalp massages too which has helped a lot.\n\nI know this list might seem like a lot to some people, but for me, having these options and rotating them has really helped my hair+scalp, especially since I wash daily while also growing out dyed ends. Also lmk if you want a more detailed review or opinion on any product i listed!! :)",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\nI wanted to share my experience so far in case it helps anyone else going through this process.\n\nI traveled alone to another country for my transplant, the first time doing something like that by myself, (I only speak English &amp; Spanish) so I was already pretty nervous going in. The clinic itself was reputable and professional, but my procedure ended up being… interesting. \n\nApparently I was an excessive bleeder, which made the whole process more complicated. At one point I even threw up after getting up and I almost fainted twice, and to make things worse, the anesthesia wore off about 10 minutes before they finished placing the grafts. That part was extremely painful. Before that I had zero pain (except when they were shoving the local anesthesia into my scalp… that part was wild lol).\nThe technicians were honestly pretty aggressive with their hands, but overall I still think they did solid work.\n\nRight after the procedure I noticed dark black blood and a yellow liquid around the grafts. I did some research and completely freaked myself out thinking it was necrosis. Then the next day, when the lady was washing my head, she said something like “infection” in Turkish, which obviously sent my anxiety through the roof.\nThankfully the doctor came in, checked everything, and reassured me that it wasn’t necrosis or an infection.\n\nFast forward: I’m now back in the U.S. and currently at week 3 post-op. All of the transplanted hairs have shed, and my hairline basically looks like it did before the transplant. I know this is part of the process, but what’s messing with my head is the density.\nOnce the scabs fell off, it honestly didn’t look like there was much hair underneath. I see other people’s photos where the density looks way better right after scab removal, so I’m worried I might eventually need a second procedure. I know I have to wait the full year to judge final results, but the waiting game is brutal.\n\nFor meds: I’ve been on Hims finasteride/minoxidil chewables for 5 months consistently before the operation and I’m still on them now.\n\nMy one bad habit: Zyn.\nI didn’t touch nicotine at all for the first 14 days post-op, and since then I’ve been doing about 1–2 per day. I’m trying to quit, but it’s tough. I’d love to hear if anyone else here used nicotine and how it affected their results long-term.\n\nOverall, I’m still really glad I did the transplant, I just hate how long the process takes and how much your brain messes with you during the early months.\n\nIf anyone has been through something similar (bleeding issues, scary post-op moments, early density anxiety), I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences.\n\nThanks for reading 🙏\n",
