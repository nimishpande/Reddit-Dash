Do you guys do the same or do u do front middle back (in terms of sections).Also how do you do it so the already product-ed hair sections don’t get in the way? I try to move it to the back but even with long hair it gets in the way and falls back. I swear every time I try and put it in a pony tail, it gets a ponytail dent and kind of clumps together. I hope this makes sense and I’m open to anything!\n\nHere’s my routine:\n1)detangle in the shower with ouidad curl quencher\n2)put in pattern moisture milk \nAnd not your mothers mousse\n3)use a curl comb (the one with ridges on the side)\nThat’s it (if you have suggestions please leave them!

      "content": "Long post ahead. FWIW, I think my hair is probably more wavy than curly, but I definitely have some curly pieces and I figured it would be better to post here than [r/wavyhair ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wavyhair/)because this sub seems to have more activity. Images above are my hair after getting wet and then air-drying with some scrunching, but no product.\n\nFor some background, I used to have very curly hair as a toddler but then it straightened out somewhat as I got older. My parents never really knew what to do with my hair, as it’s always been very thick and unruly— my mom’s hair has only the slightest wave and from what I’ve heard, my dad‘s used to be pretty curly, like perfect ringlets, but he grew up keeping his short and now doesn’t have any, so not much help. Basically I’ve gone through my whole life with my hair looking like a puffy mess— I regularly attack it with a plastic brush, and sometimes I use detangler too, but still it’s pretty much a pyramid of frizz by the time I get home every day. It also has a tendency to develop snags and tangles in specific patches— there’s a pretty nasty one in the back that always seems to develop no matter what I do. I’ve grown up being told by stylists that my hair has some natural curl to it, but I don’t know how to treat it so I just default to the treatment I was raised with meant for straight hair, and the cycle repeats itself. Until very recently, my routine has just been whatever shampoo and conditioner we keep in the shower, then brushing my hair out once it’s dry, but clearly that hasn’t worked very well for me. For the past few weeks, I’ve been washing with Super Nature Aloe Shampoo (not specialized for curly hair, but the label says it is sulfate-free) and Aussie 3-Minute Miracle Moist Detangling Conditioner every couple days, going through with a wide-tooth comb in the shower, scrunching, and wearing a bonnet to bed, and that’s definitely made my hair easier to manage, but it’s still not quite where I want it to be. I just feel so overwhelmed with all the different products and routines and I’m not sure where to start.\n\nMy main goal is simply maintaining my overall hair health, as I think years of treating it like it’s straight have probably led to some damage, judging by how easily it gets frizzy and tangles. But I’m also hoping for a more defined wave or curl pattern. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to get it back to where it was when I was little, but as you can see from the pictures, it‘s pretty curly in the bottom layers and closer to my neck, then the outer layers are more limp, with just a few curly pieces. I’d like to get that same kind of definition on the outer layers too if possible, but I’m not really sure how to achieve this.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Idk I think I’m “aging” now?\n\nI don’t wear makeup often but sometimes wear a prescription topical for my rosacea depending on where I’m going.\n\nBasically I want a super basic routine that doesn’t make any of those things worse lol.

I’ve been on curology for about a month or so, and I haven’t really seen any changes so far. I’ve started a 100mg dose of doxycycline a day or two ago so hopefully that’ll help a bit. I also use a light lotion. I will honestly say that I’m not the most consistent with applying sunscreen.\n\nA lot of the scarring around my cheeks happened recently after an acne breakout and some shaving issues. Because a lot of it can be attributed to outer damage by shaving, I’m wondering whether the red scarring on my cheeks can even be healed through traditional methods or if I have to try microneedling or accutane or something.\n\nI’m just wondering if any of you all had tips on fixing my acne, especially my large pores and scarring.

I really want to smell like a warm, elegant, orange-vanilla mocktail. However, I’ve run into a dilemma. I don’t have a budget, and I’ve been looking into higher-end products, but none of them seem to have good vanilla body washes that don’t have a million other scent in them that I don’t want. And when I look at cheaper options, they’re always sugary vanilla instead of warm/spicy vanilla. I don’t wanna smell like a sugar cookie! I hate sugar! I guess finding orange products is a little easier, but I still need recommendations. I can’t find any higher-end products with good orangey-citrus scents. Also, what types of things do I need to complete my routine? So far, I’ve only been searching for washes, oils, perfumes, and lotions. But is there anything else? The photos I’ve included are just there to provide a visual for the VIBE I’m going for, by the way. Other scents I enjoy include jasmine, lavender (slightly), and sometimes florals.",

My hair seems to break off around this length so I’m going to see if frequent trims helps it get longer. But if I’m going to the salon, should I get some layers and if I do, how extreme should I go?\n\nLast pic is just to see what layers may look like. I don’t know if cutting the top layer super short will make the tops curly bc I think my hair grows kind of straight at the root. \n\nRoutine: \n\nWash: Suave clarifying shampoo 1x or more a week, tresemme shampoo and conditioner. Occasionally use Trader Joe’s hair mask. Would love recs for shampoo and conditioner but I def do better with some sulfates than none\n\nStyle: squish to condish, rinse up side down, add Kevin Murphy mousse to roots and scrunch, add quarter size of Not Your Mothers Curl Talk gel and scrunch. Spray with Not Your Mothers salt spray and diffuse (mostly right side up, but sometimes upside down) \n\nSleep/refresh: pineapple bun, sometimes a hair buff. Not ideal so I usually do a pretty heavy spray refresh every morning and diffuse to mostly dry. Occasionally use the vents in my car to dry the rest. Which is fun to see if you drive past me at a red light\n\nThanks!!",

I tend to scar easily and somehow I’m always hurting myself so consequently I have tons of scratch marks/scars on my legs and also a few burn marks on my arms. \n\nWhile I’m sure I can’t do anything about the burn marks, I would like to know which products would help with hyperpigmentation and other scars such as scratches and bug bites. I’ve bought the ordinary glycolic acid to give it a try but I’ve heard it best to pair exfoliants with some type of moisturizer, which I have no clue what to search for or what products help brighten skin. Though, I have heard about Alpha Arbutin, but I’m not sure if it’s actually good or what strength to get.\n\nTL;DR : I would love to hear recommendations such as serums, toners, lotions, or body washes for (kinda??) severe body hyperpigmentation and scarring.
