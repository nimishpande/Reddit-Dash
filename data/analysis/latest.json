It has a silicone texture which worked as a great base for me when doing whatever minimal makeup I was doing. On my regular days this sunscreen and Kay loose powder was all I used to look put together. But since this has raised doubts in me regarding the sun protection I sadly had to look for another option 🥲.\n\nBeauty of Joseon : This spreads beautifully and does not take time to blend like UV doux. No silicony texture which I miss. Cant say anything about sun protection as there was no prolonged exposure or harsh Sun in December. ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "I recently shifted to Gurgaon. Earlier, I was using Jovees face wash, toner, and sunscreen. After trimming my beard with a blade one day, when I already had blackheads, I started breaking out.\n\nMy main issue is that I have oily skin. I get blackheads and whiteheads, and they often turn into pus-filled acne.\n\nAfter the breakout, I stopped using everything and started using only Saslic DS and a toner twice a day. Even after that, my skin still gets very oily, especially during office hours, even when I haven’t applied anything. I’m also still breaking out.\n\nI’m confused and worried now. If I’m using Saslic DS twice a day and not applying any moisturizer, can that actually make my skin produce more oil and cause more acne?\n\nAt this point, I honestly don’t know what to follow. I feel lost when it comes to skincare and understanding which products are right for oily, acne-prone skin 😔.\n\nI currently have the following products with me:\n\n\t1.\tSaslic DS 2%\n\n\t2.\tJovees Tea Tree Face Wash (pH 5.5)\n\n\t3.\tJovees Cucumber Toner\n\n\t4.\tPlum Rice Water &amp; Niacinamide 2% Hybrid Sunscreen\n\n\t5.\tDot &amp; Key Cica Calming Oil-Free Moisturiser\n\n\t6.\tBenzoyl Peroxide 2.5%\n\nIf my current products aren’t suitable, please suggest better options and a simple routine. I’d really appreciate guidance on how to understand skincare and what actually helps.\n\nPS - i have been on isotretinoin med years ago and it worked very well but i stopped it as it is steroid.",

      "title": "[Misc] Unhappy with mole removal scars. Any advice?",
      "content": "Hi all, just looking for some advice on what to do about my scars from moles I had removed 14 months ago. The first photo is of a scar on my jaw, that mole was flat, but large and brown. The second photo is under my chin, that mole was the colour of my skin but prominent enough to see in photos of my side profile. Unfortunately I don't have any before photos.\n\nI had these removed by a derm using the burn method (his rec), and I'm unhappy with the results. There are still bumps on both sites which I thought would have smoothed out by now. I went back to the derm a couple times for follow ups and he did a touch up on my chin (more burning which I feel like did nothing) and injected what I think was a steroid into my jaw to reduce the bump. The bump flattened for about a week each time, then came back.\n\nThe derm said that's basically all he can do, that the bump on my chin is likely just because of hairs (still very much feels like the entire mole is there), and I can keep coming back for injections to try and flatten the bump on my jaw (I don't want to keep doing this because it's not permanent).\n\nAny advice on what to do? Should I be seeing a laser tech for scars or something? I'm not well versed in skincare so unsure of my options, Google hasn't been helpful. Should I go back to the derm yet again? Cosmetic surgeon for full extrication of the remainder of the moles?\n\nSuper grateful for any responses, thank you!",

      "content": "My hair is a 3b-3c curl pattern, and I desperately want to loosen it. The issue is not so much the hair itself, it is more so that it is hard for me to style it in a way that frames my face. I have a larger forehead and small facial features, and often having a part in my hair (middle or off center) creates unflattering proportions with my face. I would like to loosen the curls however I can, in the least damaging way possible, so that I have more freedom with styling and cut. With how tight the curls are, bangs would be impractical as the hair floats more than it hangs down. Please let me know any recommendations for treatments, products, or styles to try. (For context, my routine includes the raw sugar moisture smoothie shampoo 1-2x/week, daily conditioner of the same brand, leave in conditioner (Matrix brand “A curl can dream,”) and gel (Not Your Mother’s coconut). I strictly air dry and occasionally oil the ends, as well as use a Hask brand keratin hair mask overnight. I use a bonnet overnight, and completely wet my hair everyday instead of a refresh routine).",

When I consulted dermatologist in Feb 2024 he suggested me metrogyl gel and aclin gel and a antiseptic to wash. But for some reason It didn't work. Again when I consulted a different doc in late April. He told to use Aclin+metrogyl gel+ Eryn as a combo in morning and at night use adapalene+ clindamycin gel. During these times I didn't use any moisturizers or cleansers. Again I consulted a dermo in June as it didn't work properly. He told to use Benzoyl peroxide(morning&amp;night) + aclin gel(morning). I read recently Bp shouldn't be used in the morning so I avoided. Till now it doesn't work properly. Sometimes I am not consistent. Recenyly I added Bioderma intensive care moisturizer gel. Wt to do please help? I still have all the products with me. Suggest me a routine to follow. What will work for me?",
