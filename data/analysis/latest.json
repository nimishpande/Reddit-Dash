The explanation is gonna be long bc i had to spend so long perfecting my hair bc it's SOOOO picky.\n\nI didn't really unclump the bottom parts so ignore the uneven lengths.\n\nRoutine: \n\nShampoo and conditioner: Marc Anthony triple moisturizing \n\nLeave in conditioner: As I am Leave in \n\nCurl cream: Miss Jessie's Multicultural Curl Cream\n\nGel: The Doux Big Poppa Gel\n\nBrushes: Tangle Teezer and Knock off bounce curl brush \n\nFor each small section: Wet hair. Apply leave in. Wet again. Brush . Add curl cream. Massage. Brush. Wet. Add gel. Massage. Brush with knock off curl brush. Repeat for every section .  If my hair did not feel silky after this I'd wet it again and add some more gel LOL. I have a lot of hair so it took a long time. \n\nBlow drying it took even longer. If i try air drying or scrunching with a microfiber towel before diffusing, my hair will throw a fit and then frizz up. I hover and blow dry on high until there's a lot of casting and definition, then with medium heat i put the diffuser to the bottom of my hair and blow dry up. I flip my head side to side doing this. Then after i see more definition and it begins to dry i switch to cold and scrunch the hair till its half its length and just repeat that. It was still damp when i stopped so i let it air dry for a few hours.\n\nLast week I washed my hair and used Loreals glossing shampoo and conditioner. Before that I used loreals clarifying shampoo and conditioner and mielles babusu and mint deep contioner. I use those three in a cycle.\n\nWhen i sleep i normally wrap it in a silk scarf and then put  a bonnet on over that. I'm a crazy sleeper and it works.\n\nI normally hate doing my hair because of how soaked i get but i cant function with a towel over my shoulders. It's overstimulating and i hate it lmfao. But i made myself power through it and here we go! Pretty sure this is the most perfected my routine has gotten. But there's still some frizz so who knows...\n\nLOL i love it tho. So cute. I have curtain bangs too.",

      "content": " \nI was using minimalist and plum sunscreens last year and they just felt very sticky, greasy or just uncomfortable out in the sun. But this sunscoop actually feels like a proper body lotion that just happens to have SPF 50+ PA++++ in it. Like i just get out of the shower, pump it out like a normal body lotion which acts as a sunscreen too 😭\n\n**Texture and feel**\nVery smooth lotion texture. Not runny, not thick and spreads easily and absorbs pretty fast. After it settles, it doesn’t feel heavy or oily. My skin just feels normal and soft. I can get dressed in a few minutes without that sticky sunscreen feeling.\n\nIt’s SPF 50+ PA++++ with broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection. I’ve worn it out in proper sun and didn’t notice tanning or redness. \n\n**Ingredients I liked**\nWhat makes it better than basic sunscreens is the added skincare.\n5 percent Niacinamide to help with pigmentation and even skin tone.\nIt has 5 Essential Ceramides too.\n\n**Full ingredient list on the bottle:**\nPurified Water, Octocrylene, Niacinamide, Octyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Trehalose, Methylene Bis Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Avena Sativa Oat Kernel Extract, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Aloe Vera Extract, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Propanediol, 1,2 Hexanediol, Hexyldecanol, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Ceramide AS, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide NG, Sodium Acrylate Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, C15 19 Alkane, Fragrance, Sodium Polyacrylate, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer 6, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium EDTA, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum.\n\nIt’s also free from Benzophenone, Formaldehyde &amp; Oxybenzone, atleast that's what the bottle says.\n\n**Hydration**\nIt actually feels moisturizing. I’ve skipped my regular body lotion a few times and this alone was enough. No dryness, no tightness.\n\nI do not write such long reviews but i am fr in love with this Sunscoop sunscreen body lotion and is honestly the most comfortable body sunscreen I’ve used. High protection, good ingredients, lightweight feel and no greasy mess. For daily use, it’s a solid 10 for me. \n\nDefinitely repurchasing!!!",

My boyfriend helped me discover that I have curly hair after years of dealing with frizzy, wavy hair. first and second photo is my hair after being conditioned, gelled (with a heavy styling gel), and dried with a diffuser. Now I’m frustrated because my hair is dry and dead due to bleach, but I’d like to refresh it to allow these curls to be trained. I was thinking of getting a haircut like Clairo’s because I’ve heard that layers help tremendously. Any advice or thoughts? Thanks! \n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Hair was wet in shower, I used my fingers to comb it while wet. \n\n2. Out of shower I used a microfibre cloth to gather it gently.\n\n3. I ran a bunch of Cantu shea butter hold styling gel throughout with my fingers, evenly covering my hair until it was straight\n\n4. I gently pressed the bottom part of my hair upwards to bring out the curls\n\n5. I used a diffuser for \\~25 minutes doing the same \n\n(First 2 images are the result of bf doing these steps while 3+4 are me attempting to style my own… 🙃)",

So, I'm making this post to hopefully help some folks keep good spirits about this whole thing. Especially as talk of new treatments is all the rave right now.\n\nI just want to start right away with saying that regardless of who you are, you aren't alone in the slightest. Hair loss is a very common condition, and there is no shame in being upset about it. You're not bad or worth and less just because your hair is losing density or is receding (or both). It's not your fault, nor really anyone's fault.\n\nIn the modern age, there are a plethora of treatments available to you. From Fin and Dut, to Minox and dermarolling. These aren't universal remedies though, sadly, and won't work for everyone. If these don't work for you, don't beat yourself up for it. The fact that you are trying is more than enough; hell, most folks don't even know they can stop / slow down hairloss in the first place. If worst comes to worst, you can always try wigs / hair systems, and you shouldn't feel bad for doing so. You can also get a hair transplant, given that the medications helped stabilize your loss. Plenty of sources on reputable surgeons and clinics out there. Caring about how you look isn't something to be ashamed about, especially if you're more masculine leaning. \n\nOf course, you might not want to wear wigs, which is more than fair. I could literally feel my wallet die when looking at some of those prices lol. That and the upkeep for those things seems about on par with something in a museum.\n\nRegardless, you don't have to be bald if you don't want to, especially in this day and age (given you are willing to spend a lot of money on this stuff lmao). And even if you do go completely bald, you aren't any less you than you were when you first started losing it. You still have value, regardless of how you look. \n\nNow regarding the future, I'm pretty optimistic. It's a common trope to say that it'll just be five years away (regarding any type of cure), but it seems like things are definitely rolling right now in a good direction. Technology will continue to advance and with that, more R&amp;D regarding this issue and funding pertaining. Now, I don't necessarily believe things like PP405 or VDPHL01 will be our true panaceas, but from what we know about them, they'll certainly help us down the line regarding our hair loss. The future is very uncertain, but it doesn't come all at once; just a day at a time. Patience is key.\n\nRemember, we're all in this game together whether we wanted to be or not. The best thing we can do is keep our spirits up and support each other when we can. ",

I have NEVER been someone who says \"My hair grows really fast,\" but now I can see actual progress, when before, my hair would literally never grow beyond my shoulders (when curly). My hair journey is as follows\n\nMiddle school: Str\\*\\*tened my hair several times per week :(\n\nHigh School: Realized how damaged my hair was and dove headfirst into the Curly Girl method. This was not the way FOR ME, personally. I did this throughout college. My scalp was SCREAMING. I also had bad brushing habits and my hair was constantly dry. BUT, it was cute, and my curl pattern came back. I was doing crazy shit you guys. I was putting eggs and avocado on my head. I was dry detangling my hair for an hour with my fingers. I was using all natural shampoos that had the washing power of candle wax. These were not the days.\n\nPost College: Gave up on my dreams. I started using Head and Shoulders, all of the sulfates and silicones (go figure) and kept it basically all drugstore.\n\nEarly 2025: Discovered the Abbey Yung method... and I gotta say... it makes sense.\n\nI just want to say I know that hair is different for everyone, but leaving the CGM did wonders for my hair growth and health. I thought that Head and Shoulders would dry my hair out, but I have quickly discovered that with the right level of conditioning and oils, all of my hair is happier than ever.\n\nCurrent Routine:\n\nUsually a pre oil treatment or Olaplex 3 (K18 after a tax return though, you feel me??)\n\nHead and shoulders (never 2-in-1, though wondering if I should try it for extra conditioning) rinse and repeat. Usually leave on for a few minutes to let the medication settle in.\n\nConditioner: Matrix Food for Soft OR Dove 10-in-1 serum Bond Strength Mask\n\nLeave in: Usually Miss Jessie's Leave-In Condish (the best!) Currently trying Redken ABC. Had high hopes, but it's not thick enough for my hair and doesn't give me the best detangling experience.\n\nCurl Cream: Trying Curls Don't Lie by Isima. Its not a 10/10 but its pretty good!\n\nAir dry: always, because I find it easier.\n\nOil: my lengths with MoroccanOil or OGx Coconut Miracle Oil every other day-ish, depending on literally nothing except what's easier to reach for in my cabinet.\n\nI don't refresh other than oil, I just let it go and look a bit frizzy. Less is more for me\n\n  \nIf you've read this far, what product surprised you or helped you tremendously in reaching your hair goals?? xoxo ",

      "content": "I’ve gotten a few questions here about my skincare lately, so I thought I’d share my experience in case it helps someone.\n\nI’ve been pretty genetically blessed with good skin most of my life. Nothing perfect, but generally clear and low-maintenance. Then about two years ago, I suddenly started getting flare-ups with acne and what I believe was perioral dermatitis. It just wouldn’t go away and was really bothering me. I went to an aesthetician/skin clinic, and they recommended Green Peel. We started with the mildest version, Green Peel Fresh Up.\n\nThe photos I’m sharing are after one Fresh Up treatment, and honestly… I was blown away by the results.\n\nAt the same time, I was also using Elixir SOS Paste, plus generally trying to be more consistent with good skincare, so I can’t say it was 100% only the peel. But the difference was very noticeable. Since then, I’ve done the Fresh Up two more times and plan to do one more in about a month before moving up to the next level. Every time, my skin just looks clearer, calmer, and more glowy. For me, it hasn’t been too uncomfortable. There’s some tingling and mild peeling, but nothing extreme. And the glow afterwards is unreal.\n\nThe “after” photos are about 1.5 years old now, but I’ve also added a more recent photo so you can see that the results have lasted. I’m a bit more tan there because I just got back from vacation (used SPF 50, of course), but overall my skin quality is still really good.\n\nFor reference: I am 35 and have light, Nordic, sensitive skin. They also did one of those skin scans/analyses at the clinic, and my overall skin quality has improved a lot since starting Green Peel + better skincare.\n\nSo is it only the Green Peel? Probably not. It’s likely a combination of treatments + products + consistency. But I do think Green Peel played a big role for me. Not sponsored, not an ad — just sharing my experience. Take from it what you want. Happy to answer questions if anyone has them.",

      "content": "hi!! so this is gonna be a LOT because my hair journey has been a lot lol, bear with me PLS i’m desperate! (23F)\n\ni have fine, low density, inconsistently curly, frizzy, dry high porosity hair. im now going to just list out all my complaints  lol:\n\na) it curls differently every time i style it… no matter if i follow the same routine. sometimes i get cute fluffy curls, other times i get flat tight curls, or half straight/half curl, etc etc. \n\nb) it dries so fast. like i put it loosely in a soft tshirt after i shower for more than 2 minutes and it’s completely dry on the ends. or if i don’t put a towel on it and wait two minutes with my hair hanging wet, the roots are completely dry.\n\nc) it’s so prone to breakage. i have so many split ends and my hair is a different length everywhere. i did a big chop in 2023 for healthiness and it wasn’t as rewarding now that it’s grown back lol. but i cut my split ends like every week at work in small sections to keep it healthy. i also get trims every 2-3 months. should i go sooner??? its $60 + tip yall im broke\n\nd) my hair falls out easily it feels like (you’ll see why im not sure if u keep reading to the next section). i feel like ive been trying to grow it back from the scalp for years and its just getting worse or staying the same idek anymore. i do see a lot of baby hairs growing at the scalp but not nearly as many as i feel i should be after all this time :/\n\ne) even when i do put heat in my hair it just looks frizzy or doesn’t hold well. i know some of the frizz is because my hair is diff lengths all over because of all the breakage and regrowth.\n\nf) a lot of my ends feel blunt idk if that means anything. there’s also a lot of ends that are flimsy soft. also a lot of random coarse \\~\\~\\~\\~\\~ type hairs u know???\n\ng) the top layer of hair (from the crown and top of my scalp), is super thin and short and mostly straight but the middle is very curly and less fine. the underneath at the back just only curls at the end. \n\nh) hair gets greasy easily if i use too much product \n\ni) scalp can be very dry and flakey but the flakes but stick to my scalp unless i hit my head upside down. i use nizoral shampoo in replacement of ouai when this happens!\n\nOKAY IM SORRY IM LONG WINDED BUT PLS I NEED ADVICE 😭\n\nhere’s also things that are barriers and have affected my hair health (i struggle a lot with mental health but pls im still funny and cool and awesome i just have a LOT of sparkle yk)\n\na) i struggled with trichotillomania for yeaaars like pulling probably hundreds of pieces of hair out individually (not in chunks) every day. and i still engage in the behavior slightly… but only like a couple hairs here and there. im working really hard to overcome it so pls dont advise me to stop because i know and im doing so!! trying my hardest!\n\nb) i am in recovery for anorexia but i struggled with it for just as long as i did the trich. getting in protein is really hard for me because i also have arfid (im telling u guys god rly nerfed me lol). so i assume that effects my hair health as well at least in some regard.\n\nc) i definitely have a good amount of heat damage because i used to rely on heat to feel good about my hair. i would always use heat protectant and serum.. but still not great. i have made it a point to stop using heat and embrace the curl. i’m doing okay, i have only used heat 3 times so far this year which i know is lowkey a lot but im interviewing for grad school so i can’t have my hair be frizzy LOL\n\nd) i have POTS so blood tends to pool in my feet and not go to my extremities or my head?? not too sure how brain flow to POTS patients compares to that of regular people lol. but im sure there is correlation.\n\ne) one thing i know ISNT wrong is my thyroid because i get my blood work tested all the time cause i have chronic illnesses. lmk if anyone wants to know my results idk if its helpful. is that weird to offer 😭\n\nf) i have this compulsive need to play with my hair like twirl it/run strands between my fingers. i’ve done it my entire life like there are pictures of me at 2 years old doing it. i just take strands of here and run them between my pointer and middle finger lol. not sure if that affects my hair health but prob \n\nOKAY LAST PART. pls if ur still reading im almost done JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE IM DESPERATE LOL \n\nhere is my current routine / things ive tried:\n\ni wash my hair every 4ish days, almost always double cleanse, and i cycle these 3 routines:\n\nWASH A:\n\n\\- ouai detox shampoo &amp; davines energizing shampoo\n\n\\- k18 (after shower)\n\nWASH B:\n\n\\- redken extreme length &amp; loreal elvive hyaluronic plump shampoo \n\n\\- davines nounou conditioner (leave in for 5ish min)\n\nWASH C:\n\n\\- davines energizing shampoo &amp; loreal elvive hylauronic plump shampoo\n\n\\- davines nounou conditioner\n\nPOST SHOWER:\n\n\\- not your mothers curl talk leave in conditioner\n\n\\- devacurl wavytalk curl cream\n\n\\- goldwell just smooth serum\n\n\\*\\* sometimes i also use itsa10 gloss leave in spray\n\nDAILY:\n\n\\- i typically spray my hair wet every morning with water w/ a couple drops of peppermint essential oil in the spray bottle, use my bounce curl brush, and use devacurl wavy talk to restore my curl. \n\n\\- i use goldwell just smooth everyday\n\n\\- on wash day, i will wear my hair in a loose slick back using softee castor oil conditioner \n\n\\- once a week i use amika dream routine overnight hydration mask &amp; ouai scalp serum\n\n\\- i tie my hair back or wear it in braids at night \n\nTHINGS IVE TRIED:\n\n\\- minoxidil serum &amp; foam: is this fr my only/best option??? i have pets who sleep at the top of my pillow. i also find it makes my hair greasy faster and sticky/separated at the roots. i am difficult ab minoxidil bc i also wont take the pill for personal reasons lol. \n\n\\- hair oiling: did it for years and feel like it didnt rly do anything and it lowkey made it worse (i used a rosemary blend on the scalp and jojoba through the shaft/ends)\n\n\\- big chop: cut my hair to a bob already and it took forever to grow back and it didnt really fix the problem. (i could’ve done more for my hair health but i dont want to go thru that process of regrowth again)\n\n\\- ouai scalp serum: idk if i used it long enough to notice a true difference but the consistency was tough after awhile lol \n\nOK I THINK THATS EVERYTHING IM SORRY it was so long u guys but im 23 and have been struggling with my hair since i was a teenager. i just want to get it to where i want it so i can feel more confident and feminine!\n\nany tips are appreciated :,) pls ik the internet can be so brutal so be kind to me lol but also dont lie to me plsss i can handle it haha ik my hair isn’t great. only thing i wont do is shave my head!!\n\ni just want to:\n\n\\- revive my curl and reduce frizz\n\n\\- stimulate new growth and retain length\n\n\\- strengthen &amp; hydrate ends\n\n\\- improve overall hair health and appearance \n\n\\- i need silk pillow case and bonnet recs!!\n\ni posted this in a couple hair communities sorry if ur seeing this twice!\n\nhopefully at least one person reads this mf novel 😭",

Imagine being in the office sneezing now stop and getting all red 😭\n\nHas anyone with similar skin successfully used a KIKO foundation that stays put?\n\nAlso any tips on: • primers that help with dry skin\n• setting sprays/powders that actually keep makeup in place\n• applying around the nose without it disappearing\n\nThanks so much 💛",

      "content": "I made a post about my stubborn bumpy skin 5 years ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/s/1J3fH4FNwa)\n\nI’ve delt with textured skin, especially on my forehead, for MANY years. I’ve dealt with acne as well, mostly when I was a young teen. I still get pimples but not cystic.\n\nNow I don’t want to jinx it, but I’ll tell a bit about what has helped my skin a long way. It’s not texture free by any means, but it looks a lot better than what it used to.\n\nI tried a lot of different things to treat the bumps… I thought it might be fungal so I used nizoral. I thought they were closed comedones so I tried so many different acne treatments and exfoliations. You name it, I’ve probably tried it. In the process of dealing with this for years, I think I’ve deeply irritated and dried out my skin.\n\n4 months ago I decided to simplify my routine and cutting out all actives completely. ALL actives. I switched to a non-foam face wash,  a hydrating serum and a cicabio creme. And then I waited, patiently. It didn’t really seem to make a difference at first. I was scared I was clogging up my skin, considering how oily and acne prone it is. But I kept my cool and continued the routine.\n\nThen I introduced a 10% urea moisturizer underneath the cicabio at night, and just the moisturizer during the day. It’s been a month now, and my skin is calmer, less oily and less bumpy than it’s been in a long time.\n\nI know a lot of people struggle with these bumps and while it might be fungal or comedones for some - I just wanted to share what’s helped me. Especially during a very cold and long winter. My skin is still dehydrated and there is still texture. But as you can see in the after pics, its a LOT better.\n\nI’ll probably try and introduce a retinol again in a couple of months. But for now I’ll continue to focus on healing my skin.\n\nFull routine:\n\n\\- Matas Core Squalane Gel Cleanser\n\n\\- Purito Wonder Releaf Serum\n\n\\- Bioderma Cicabio Creme\n\n\\- 10% Urea Inkey List Moisturizer",

We air dry, the blow dryer is not an option. It would be like blow drying a large, angry cat. If it gets really frizzy we use some ouidad climate control spray. \n\nMy 15 year old daughter has very curly hair.  She also is diagnosed with autism, adhd, and bipolar 1. She has a lot of sensory issues. Getting through her hair routine is a nightmare in itself. \n\nIn between washes, her curls in back get flattened, which makes it look kind of matted. I know this is probably an impossibility, but does anyone have any advice to help that?  She can't handle having her hair pulled back, or wearing a bonnet- I've tried both. Does anyone have any ideas to keep her hair from looking like a family of possums has been living in it? Or maybe really cute short cuts that would just eliminate the problem? Here's what it looks like from the front,  then the back on wash day, then between washes.\n\nI know I'm probably asking for a solution that doesn't exist, but please be kind.  I'm just a mom that doesn't know what else to try,  but is tired of having her child's hair referred to as \"unkempt\"; and is equally tired of dealing with the meltdowns and angry outbursts when I try to put her hair up or use a bonnet for sleep.

      "content": "So I grew up in a religion where women don't cut their hair. My hair has always been medium fine but it maxed out around my middle back area. I cut it for the first time out of rebellion when I was 13 and I cut it to a little bit below my shoulders. I think I used my sister's nail scissors (not sure why, they were the only ones available but better than kitchen scissors 😅) and my hair was so healthy even though the length looked awkward on me. Within about 2 years or so it grew longer than it ever had been before the chop and it was so healthy and beautiful, but I started trimming it because I wanted it to be even longer. Unfortunately I didn't use proper scissors and I think it did more harm than good.\n\nIt's been 2 years since then and my hair pretty much maxed out again and I stopped trimming it, hoping it'd just magically grow (it obviously didn't). My mom's hair is below her butt and she hasn't cut it in 20+ years so I was just hoping things would work out for me 🥹 Over the last few months I've been making changes to help my hair out. I stopped using traditional hair ties and switched to satin scrunchies and those hair ties with no rubber band. I stopped using heat on my hair and I blow dry using cold/warm air on low speed. I was oiling my hair consistently for a bit (rosemary on scalp 30 mins before shower, argan+castor oil on length/ends) and massaging my scalp, but I've fallen off and only do it occasionally.\n\nI won't go on and on about all the products, I'll just put them all in a picture if anyone knows anything about them. I did finally make the choice to cut off about 2 inches of my see through split ends and it has been amazing honestly. it's not insanely noticeable like my first chop but it already looks way healthier. I don't know how often to trim 🤷‍♀️ I'm not very focused on thickening my hair, I think it's thick enough that I can do styles but not so thin that it's noticeable. I have never dyed my hair or had it professionally done, I want to eventually though, I just don't know what I want yet. I wanted to even out my hair with my DIY layers but that'd bring me way too short so I'll wait it out lol. My goal length is about stomach length, no longer than my waist, but it'll definitely take a few years. If you know anything I don't, I'd be so grateful if you shared some knowledge with someone who has never learned much about her hair 😅",

And if not, how should oil free, water-resistant sunscreens be removed?\n\nFWIW, I'm wondering about chemical sunscreens here, not mineral (I don't wear mineral sunscreens).

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine?

With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

Is there anything specifically you might recommend for this mane of mine?\n\nAs far as routine, I wash and condition daily with dove shampoo and conditioner. I rinse in cool water, upside down, and then apply leave in conditioner. Brand depends on availability at TJ Maxx since I'm trying different things, but right now it's Curl Smith. From there, I apply a bit of Lotta Body foaming mousse and pop everything in a silk bonnet for sleep and my hair is dry and looks like this in the morning. \n\nI'd been treating my hair this way for about 2 months after noticing some waves starting halfway down my back, but I feel a little lost. Currently having a tiny identity crisis because I went from the 2a to curls pipeline REAL fast. I'm not confident enough to say which hair type I have now, because it seems like its evolving a bit.\n\nThe closeup photo is from this morning, and the longer shot is from Saturday when my hair was cut. It can cut dry, and then a bit of Lotta Body wash applied in the salon, so lots of touching ans manipulation on that day. After not touching it and proceeding as normal the curls appear to have enhanced. ",
