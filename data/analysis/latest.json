I only shampoo my scalp and let the foam run down, then condition the mid to ends and detangle while it’s wet. Once a week I use a hair mask instead of conditioner and that helped a lot. After the shower I don’t towel dry, I put my curl cream on while it’s still soaking wet and scrunch, then add a bit of gel. I squeeze the water out with a T-shirt, let it dry without touching it, and once it’s fully dry I scrunch with a little serum. Way less frizz and way more definition so far 😌\n\nProducts I use:\n\nJoviality Curl Wonder Shampoo\n\nBless Conditioner\n\nRaw African Maya Hair Mask\n\nThe Hair Addict Frizz-Off Curl Activator\n\nBio Soft Flaxseed Gel\n\nLocken Glossy Hair Serum",

      "content": "Hi so I have ADHD and sometimes when i’m bored i started plucking my eyebrows and upper lips just to clean things up when i can’t go to the salon but lately my chin and lower lip area have been darker and instead of going to derm for the hyperpigmentation i thought since it looks like hair i should just pluck it so i started plucking and it went on for hours because it wouldn’t look even and but then eventually i stopped because it looked too red\n\nNext day there was crusting on the corners of my lips but rest looked fine so i just washed my face and applied plain vaseline\n\nNow yesterday I got the urge to pluck hair again because the uneven skin tone was bothering me so i started again and yk the crusting from the previous session 3 days ago was still there and healing but i went at it anyway and it went on for hours and i plucked till my skin started bleeding so much and i pulled out the hairs that were just on the surface and about to grow from the previous session and pulling those growing hairs caused so much bleeding and i pulled the crust from before as well and now its all a mess, my chin bled so much last night and now it’s all inflamed and swollen and im scared of infection and the risk of ingrown hairs.\n\nI have been applying vaseline on the area but i dont know what else to do. Embarrassed about going to the doctor because what would i even say that i just picked at my skin for hours til it bled?\n\nIn the photos you can see that my lower lip is really swollen and the bottom of my chin too for some reason.\n\nAny advice on how to heal this quicker without scarring would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you\n\nAlso sorry for any typos or errors.\n\nTLDR: excessive plucking on chin til it bled and now the area around it is red and swollen and hurts. ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I wash my hair twice a week, once with shampoo and both times with conditioner. I almost always air dry my hair and I wear a bonnet to bed.\n\nFor other info if it matters, most of my family has oily hair, and I assume I would too but because I have curls it doesn't show??

      "content": "Hey there! I know NOTHING about skincare, so please be gentle.❤️ But I did some research months ago and decided to buy these products (pictures below). My face dries really fast. Even slightly patting my face with a towel dries all of the water, so I try to pat as lightly as I possibly can. Then I apply 2 drops of HA, 2 drops of Niacinamide, wait until it dries (about 15-20 seconds), and then I apply a big pea sized moisturiser. After about 3-5 minutes, my face feels a little bit dry again. Sometimes a tiiiiny bit firm, but nothing dramatic.\n\nAm I using the wrong products? Am I using them wrong? Am I possibly using too much, or too little?\n\nHabits and skin type:\n\nNot sure how to describe my face’s skin type. It’s dry, but also oily. My nose and forehead are the most oily. My cheeks tend to get dry thin flakes every now and then. I drink over 1,5L of water a day. Usually more. I do however not wash and moisturise my face daily. I struggle a lot mentally and tend to neglect self care sometimes, but I’m working on getting better. Could not washing and moisturising my face daily possibly be a part of the problem?\n\nAny and all advice and help are more than welcome! Thank you for reading, and thank you in advance!🫶",

I've come across a video from a famous dermatologist on instagram who really recommends using adapalene gel for blackheads, whiteheads, minimizing pores, etc. etc., and I've been meaning to ask:\n\n1. Is adapalene gel actually that good, or is it some marketing strategy said dermatologist is using?\n2. If it is as good as they say and gives the seeked results, **how can I incorporate it into my skincare routine?** I'm using glycolic acid toner, centella tone brightening serum, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, cosrx snail mucin (occasionally), eye cream, moisturizer and then medicube's new pdrn pink collagen cream (contains salmon DNA).\n3.

I have been trying to adopt a routine using like beginner level stuff such as a light weight curly cream and styling serum gel after my regular hair wash with loreal hyaluron moisture range-shampoo and sometimes conditioner.....I used to simply wash my hair and after washing it and comb it through while raking it in the products and just scrunching them and letting them air dry after but the waves were not defined and it was difficult to style since the waves would fall out literally the next day or within the drying period( image 1) also it was take really long to dry my hair and I don't really have a difuser so yeah ... It was giving me the not good enough result so I basically dropped the routine for a few days now .. yesterday after a lot of thought I tried the bowl method, it was my first time trying that so I just detangled my hair and then I just dipped into water and scrunched up without any products and this was the wave pattern after drying (image 2-4).. I don't really know how to feel about my hair because it's just somewhere in between and it's really difficult to wear outside because of this and defined, frizzy and unexplainable pattern that cannot get styled without trouble.. I would really appreciate some help and advise on what to do with my hair because it's hitting my confidence at this point..",

      "content": "A bit long but please read to see if you can advise \n\nA year ago I decided to do something about my shitty corners I’ve had since birth and started using minoxidil. For some dumb reason I decided to use it on my scalp too, I probably didn’t know that minoxidil was a for life thing at the time. I started to see dandruff and an itchy scalp pretty soon after but it ended up dying down so I stopped thinking about it.\n\n Around summer time I started noticing an increase in hair loss and dandruff, I was pretty sure it was all because of my use of minoxidil but I didn’t want to go through with the post minoxidil shedding so I kept with it. I started using shampoos, less minoxidil, and even the foam version but it just wasn’t working. My scalp was itchy and eventually towards the end of the year I started seeing noticeable scalp density decreases all over my scalp. \n\nI made the decision to get off minoxidil on December 19th because it was killing my scalp, very soon after I noticed less hair loss and a nice, itchy free scalp, although flakes were still there. After a week however my hair loss began to increase likely from the post minoxidil shedding. It went from bad to worse to horrible, with the peak being on the 13th and it ended up getting better from there. I switched to Sulsun Blue 2n1 and that ending up getting rid of my big flakes but I still have tiny ones that fall out when I move my hair a bit. Recently, in the past few days hair loss has been ramping up, no where near as bad as it was but still it’s been getting worse.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I had worsening density when I was using minoxidil and I still had worsening density a month after quitting, and it seems like that short period of things getting better was nothing at all. I’m scared of losing my hair, I’m only 19, and things like this aren’t seen in my family. The dermatologists I’ve seen all just tell me to wash with a different shampoo, and it helps but nothing is stopping that density from worsening and it seems like new hairs aren’t coming in anyway. Do I just need to wait it out? Is it too late to be free from minoxidil shedding? Is the flakey layer on my scalp to blame? ",

      "content": "I have naturally curly hair and usually wear it in its natural curly style using creams, gel, and mousse. My cousin’s wedding is in 3 days and I wanted to go for a blowout look this time.\n\nI’m on a tight budget and I didn’t buy a hair straightener because I hate using excessive heat on my hair. Instead, I bought one of those brush blow-dryer tools. I tried using it after washing my hair when my hair was about 80% dry, but it didn’t work well. It stayed smooth for barely 30 minutes before turning frizzy and puffy again.\n\nI can’t afford to buy new tools right now, so I’m looking for product recommendations or techniques to help the blowout last longer. I’ve seen people recommend leave-in conditioners, heat protectants, anti-frizz serums, hairspray, etc., but I’m confused about what to use and in what order, especially for curly hair.\n\nIf anyone with curly hair has managed a long-lasting blowout without using a straightener, I’d really appreciate:\n\n-Budget-friendly product suggestions\n-The correct routine/order of products\n-Prep or technique tips to reduce frizz and make it last through an event\n\n",
