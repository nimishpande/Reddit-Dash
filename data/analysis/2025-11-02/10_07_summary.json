My hair tends to be frizzy, its very porous and can't handle too much conditioner/curl creme.\n\nI was with any good shampoo I can get, occasionally using a clarifying shampoo by Cantu. Conditioner is Aussie curly conditioner, perfect and lightweight for my hair.\n\nI do all of my styling routine with my head upside down. Starting with the Noughty Curl spray on hair that is dripping but not smoking wet. I brush that through and then cup and scrunch with my hands, and then again with a microfiber towel. Then the Bed Head Foxy Curls Mousse, I usually do a blob with about 2 inch diameter. I have alot of hair but the strands are thin. Then the Noughty Jelly, just a bit distrubuted over my hair as thin and even as possible. Then the heat protection and after that I diffuse, usually takes me around 30mins for complete dry hair on low heat and low speed. I hover diffuse and then cup diffuse.\n\nIm really pleased with my hair and I think I finally have my perfect product match up for my hair 😁",

Keeping length is really important to me as my curls are so tight, it takes a while to get any length. I feel like the hair dresser took off more than needed and my hair is shorter than when I first had it cut 6 months ago. \nI've uploaded two videos for reference, sorry if they're not that good, I barely take photos or videos 😭  the one posted is the current cut. I feel like it's very short and round. I'll post the other vid in the comments. It was from last week.

I’ve tried everything you’re “supposed” to try minoxidil, finasteride, special shampoos, diet changes. Nothing has stopped it. I know looks aren’t everything, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m aging in fast forward while everyone else gets to look young a little longer. The vanity part stings, but honestly the confidence hit is worse\n\nDating apps made it very clear how much people care about hair. My matches dropped like 90% as soon as it started thinning. It’s depressing to realize how quickly you become “less attractive” over something you can’t control.\n\nI play battlefield with friends most nights and even in the chat, jokes get tossed around about my hairline like it’s just harmless fun. Maybe for them it is. For me it’s a constant reminder.\n\nSo I’m asking guys who’ve been through this:  \nDo I just shave it and move on?  \nDoes confidence really make that much of a difference?  \nHow do you accept a change you never wanted?\n\nI don’t want to feel embarrassed about something that’s just genetics but right now I do.",

BOJ Aqua Fresh Sunscreen:\n- Very moisturizing  \n- Blends like magic, no white cast  \n- Not as glowy as Japanese sunscreens, better aesthetic, not matte either  \n- I also started using the OG BOJ sunscreen and surprisingly that is thinner and lighter than this, but takes more time and effort to blend. And that isn't as moisturizing, and gets off easier.  \n- No breakouts  \n- No tanning  \n- Sticking with Skin Aqua, no repurchase  \n- **9/10**\n\n---\n\n###2. Round Lab Dokdo Toner:\n- Hydrating  \n- Very safe ingredients  \n- Nothing special  \n- Too basic for that price  \n- **6/10**\n\n---\n\n###3. Torriden Skin Booster:\n- Looks like a milky toner  \n- Very hydrating  \n- Not moisturizing  \n- **7/10**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream:\n- Best summer/AM moisturizer I've ever used  \n- Extremely hydrating, a bit moisturizing  \n- Gave me a glass-like glow once my texture was fixed  \n- A bit pricey or would've repurchased  \n- **9/10**\n\n---\n\n### 5. Formularx Barrier Relief Moisturizer:\n- Decent barrier care moisturizer  \n- Good hydration-to-moisture ratio  \n- The new Minimalist B12 pink one is better in terms of price and feel  \n- **7/10**\n\n---\n\n### 6. Goodal Hyaluron Soothing Ampoule:\n- Best calming, soothing ampoule I've used  \n- Better than Skin1004 Probio Cica ampoule  \n- Makes my skin supple, soft, and healthy  \n- Beautiful bottle  \n- Would repurchase if I keep getting it around 1k  \n- **9.5/10**\n\n---\n\n### 7. Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner: \n- I've heard it's extremely good for sensitive skin  \n- Since I do not have sensitive skin, it just felt like water to me  \n- **3/10**\n\n---\n\n### 8. Haru Haru Wonder Black Rice Toner:\n- Most hydrating toner I've ever used  \n- Too pricey tho  \n- **8/10**\n\n---\n\n### 9. Plum Rice Water and Niacinamide Toner:\n- Bang for bucks  \n- Doesn't cause any issues for my skin  \n- Softening and hydrating effect  \n- Will keep repurchasing  \n- **10/10**\n",

      "content": "I’ve been using a topical combo of Finasteride 0.1% + Minoxidil 5% for about 3 months now. Since it’s alcohol-based, my scalp has become really flaky and irritated.\n\nBefore that, I was on Minoxidil foam alone for about 4 months, which was fine. But after adding topical Fin, the shedding shot up within 2 weeks and still hasn’t slowed down. At first, I thought it was just “fin shedding,” but now I suspect scalp inflammation might be making things worse.\n\nI also started oral Fin 1mg every other day about 6 weeks ago, hoping to stabilize things.\nFor scalp care, I use Ketoconazole shampoo 3–4 times a week, but every time I shower, I still end up with a handful of hairs in the sink — especially while shampooing.\n\nHow do you guys deal with scalp inflammation while using topical solutions?\nAny tips or routines that helped you keep applying them without wrecking your scalp?",
