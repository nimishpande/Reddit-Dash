I have type 2 wavy-ish hair with a few type 3 curls thrown in but only on wash day. It’s thick but fine, low porosity, and VERY dry. I also live in a dry climate. The smell of lavender gives me migraines, and I’m partial to warm vanilla-y scents during fall/winter, coconut scents during summer, and rose scents during spring (I used to love Carol’s Daughter wash day delight in rose but they discontinued the rose scent). I also don’t follow the CG method so any and all ingredients are fine (except lavender lol).\n\nRoutine because I apparently need to: pattern clarifying shampoo, regular shampoo, sometimes detangler, medium conditioner, leave-in.

After using Hero patches a few times in row I finally got it to a poppable head. I didn’t want to mangle my face by squeezing too much and kept replacing the patch both day and night trying to absorb the rest of the gunk. Ended up getting like 4-5 decently juicy pops out of it but I *think* it might finally be empty.\n\nAnyway, unsurprisingly, the spot still looks awful. Is it time to let the area breathe and heal naturally, or can I keep putting on the patches to see if it will help speed up healing and, with any luck, reduce scarring?",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
