For back story, I had dreadlocks for 10 years and recently cut out the parts that were damaged by bleaching/coloring and brushed out the rest to get a nice restart back into the curly girly lifestyle. Keeping length is really important to me as my curls are so tight, it takes a while to get any length. I feel like the hair dresser took off more than needed and my hair is shorter than when I first had it cut 6 months ago. \nI've uploaded two videos for reference, sorry if they're not that good, I barely take photos or videos üò≠  the one posted is the current cut. I feel like it's very short and round. I'll post the other vid in the comments. It was from last week. My hair is now not even close to touching my shoulders \n\nCurrent Routine:\nUsing all Camille Rose products at the moment\nWash: Ginger rinse\nCondition: Moroccan pear\nCurl Love Curl Cream\nCurl Maker Gel",

By hollow tear troughs, I am referring to actual volume-deficient deepset hollows (aka the hereditary stuff south asians like myself have). I am not referring to eye bags. I am not referring to eye puffiness.\n\nFriends, has there been any research or update on the safety or efficacy of Volufiline use right over the eyelids? I don't know about you, but any eye serum I use is placed all over my eyelids, all the way up to the lashline because of my severe hereditary volume deficiency and the fact that I have super thin skin in my undereyes that results in tissue-darkening/show through)\n\nOr is the ordinary jeopardizing our safety now and selling snake oil?\n\n  \n",

Then the Noughty Jelly, just a bit distrubuted over my hair as thin and even as possible.

My routine before I washed it I made a flaxseed hair mask at home and applied it with a heat cap on since I have low porosity hair, then I shampooed and that‚Äôs it. I have to admit that the salon didnt apply heat protectant before blow drying it. Today I did a hot oil treatment and reshampooed. So now I‚Äôm devastated cuz my hair which is usually 3B/3C and very very curly at the bottom literally struggles to curl now a lot  parts look straight and now my whole hair looks like it‚Äôs 2a/2c with ends that barely curl.

Is it specific to what you‚Äôre trying to achieve? Or is it just preference / trial and error?\n\nI‚Äôve got a winning combo of rosacea+kp+acne+dry skin so my skin needs are vast.

      "content": "About my Skin:\nI have a combination skin, I live in a very hot humid weather. 23.\nI had a very resistant clear glass like skin with general hyperpigmentation until last year when I suddenly started getting cc because I did not take care of my skin for a very long time, then I started picking on the whiteheads and blackheads which lead to more acne. \nCurrently dealing a with pustules on cheeks sometimes, blind acne on the chin, whiteheads and skin coloured bumps throughout the face when I ocassionally forget to double cleanse my sunscreen, lot of PIE &amp; PIH, some texture from old acne, and general hyperpigmentation. Prone to comedones.\n\nSkin care Routine:\nAM: \n1. Simple Refreshing Facewash\n2. Reequil Ultra Matte Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n1. Garnier Micellar Water\n2a. Simple Refreshing Facewash\n2b. Minimalist 2% SA cleanser which I mix with Simple Cleanser on Sundays and Thursdays.\n3. Minimalist Tranexamic Acid Serum that I use on days I don't use SA Cleanser. \n4. Simple Hydrating Moisturiser mixed with pure aloe vera gel.\n5. Reequil 0.1% Retinol which I'm currently not using but planning on reintroducing on days without actives after my skin adjusts to the current routine.\n\nSunscreens I've used before:\n1. Lakme a canon event üò≠\n2. Dot &amp; Key pink - not good fliters\n3. Dr Sheth - not good filters again\n4. Deconstruct gel sunscreen - liked the texture and matte finish but they changed the formulation and it started pilling\n5. Minimalist fluid sunscreen - really good protection as per this sub but looks really oily on my skin, for this weather, makes it look very dull and oily (would work out well for people in dry weather), stings my eyes.\nI don't prefer sunscreen that has a very dewy effect.\n\n6. Current - Reequil ultra matte sunscreen, I like this sunscreen, primer like texture, doesn't make my skin look greasy, doesn't sting, good protection, claims to be water resistant,  does break me out if I don't cleanse my skin well.\nI started reading from this sub that few people started experiencing darkening skintone and white dry patches, I did not notice much in my skin but I did feel like my skintone had changed slightly, not sure if it's tanning or the product or if I didn't apply it well. And I also read that this is a common issue with any silicone based sunscreen.\nI still like this sunscreen but wondering if it's good enough.\n\nI was looking at \n1. BOJ Aqua one - but many claimed it's not worth as they wouldn't spend that much on a sunscreen that is not water resistant.\n\n2. UV Doux - really hyped in this sub, but it is also a silicone based sunscreen, and I fear it is same as Reequil.\n\nWhat's your thoughts about this??\nSorry for the long post, I do yap a lot.",

Ever other wash, use Garnier Fructius Shampoo to clarify. Every day, I wet my hair, scrunch some of the moisture out using and scrunch in AG Liquid Care Effects Medium-Hold Gel (and at the time of this post, I have just started to do the same with Not Your Mother's Defining Cream before the gel). Hover then pixie diffuse to finish.\n\nI have tried to learned literally as much as I possibly can, like protein-moisture balance, etc. Still, no matter how much experimentation I try, my hair always ends up completely undefined and without shape. Basically just volume without definition, just constant bed head. I purposefully use less moisture and more protein because my hair is finer and has a looser curl pattern (and previously I felt as if my hair was experiencing moisture overload), but my hair is still just always limp and dull. When I scrunch out there crunch, my hair instantly frizzes up despite using a high-hold, humidity-resistant gel.\n\nI can't keep my hair overnight with a bonnet because that just doesn't work, and brush styling didn't work me either (not for a lack of effort or for doing it wrong - I sectioned my hair and everything, but brush styling is just not for my hair type.) I also don't want to come off as someone with waves that is trying to achieve curls, because I definitely have loose curls, they just have no definition whatsoever. Finally, the reason why I'm bothered by this is because my hair just completely covers my face, doing the exact opposite of framing it (you can't really tell because my face is covered I. photos but trust). On rare days when my hair is actually defined, it actually frames my face really well.",

I‚Äôve never had a skincare routine and my skin was just ok, but now that it‚Äôs become a real annoyance I‚Äôm thinking maybe I should. But I don‚Äôt know what this is. I did use to just sort of get out of the shower and just aggressively scrub the shi out of my face and more so where you see the redness because these white flakes just use to appear in the morning and that‚Äôs how I would get rid of it. But now fast forward a few years later, I can see that scrubbing has given me lines or scarring or whatever it is under the corners of my mouth. I still get these white flakes but now instead I just sorta just rub them out with my fingers in the shower and it sorta works. Any products or routine that you guys think will help? Cuz I‚Äôm afraid that the redness and lines or scarring will just stay there forever. Currently I just use Vaseline to give it a protective barrier from the cold outside\n",
