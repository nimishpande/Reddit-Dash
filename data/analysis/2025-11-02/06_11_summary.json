My hair tends to be frizzy, its very porous and can't handle too much conditioner/curl creme.\n\nI was with any good shampoo I can get, occasionally using a clarifying shampoo by Cantu. Conditioner is Aussie curly conditioner, perfect and lightweight for my hair.\n\nI do all of my styling routine with my head upside down. Starting with the Noughty Curl spray on hair that is dripping but not smoking wet. I brush that through and then cup and scrunch with my hands, and then again with a microfiber towel. Then the Bed Head Foxy Curls Mousse, I usually do a blob with about 2 inch diameter. I have alot of hair but the strands are thin. Then the Noughty Jelly, just a bit distrubuted over my hair as thin and even as possible. Then the heat protection and after that I diffuse, usually takes me around 30mins for complete dry hair on low heat and low speed. I hover diffuse and then cup diffuse.\n\nIm really pleased with my hair and I think I finally have my perfect product match up for my hair 😁",

Keeping length is really important to me as my curls are so tight, it takes a while to get any length. I feel like the hair dresser took off more than needed and my hair is shorter than when I first had it cut 6 months ago. \nI've uploaded two videos for reference, sorry if they're not that good, I barely take photos or videos 😭  the one posted is the current cut. I feel like it's very short and round. I'll post the other vid in the comments. It was from last week.

I’ve tried everything you’re “supposed” to try minoxidil, finasteride, special shampoos, diet changes. Nothing has stopped it. I know looks aren’t everything, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m aging in fast forward while everyone else gets to look young a little longer. The vanity part stings, but honestly the confidence hit is worse\n\nDating apps made it very clear how much people care about hair. My matches dropped like 90% as soon as it started thinning. It’s depressing to realize how quickly you become “less attractive” over something you can’t control.\n\nI play battlefield with friends most nights and even in the chat, jokes get tossed around about my hairline like it’s just harmless fun. Maybe for them it is. For me it’s a constant reminder.\n\nSo I’m asking guys who’ve been through this:  \nDo I just shave it and move on?  \nDoes confidence really make that much of a difference?  \nHow do you accept a change you never wanted?\n\nI don’t want to feel embarrassed about something that’s just genetics but right now I do.",

For some background: I was on Accutane a few years ago for 8 months which cleared the acne on my face (and has remained clear) and back, but recently I feel like I’ve been starting to breakout on my back again. I also have dark spots that seem a bit difficult to get rid of (not sure if they’re acne scars?) I also have tiny white spots on my back which I think could be KP, since I do have KP on my arms as well, although they’re more red/skin-tone color on my arms. In the shower I always rinse my conditioner out before washing my body and I don’t let any of my hair/hair products touch my back until I have a shirt on. The products I’m currently using are: Naturium “The Perfector Salicylic Acid Body Wash,” and then after the shower Naturium “Salacylic Acid Body Spray 2%,” and then I alternate between using Naturium’s “The Glow Getter Multi-Oil Body Butter,” and Miami Beach Bum’s “Bum + Body Cream Mint.” On days I use the Beach Bum lotion, I don’t use The salicylic acid body spray. Any information/input would help. Would love to find a solution now so I can feel confident with tops I wear during the summer. Thanks!",

I used to use the Vanicream Vitamin C daily but stopped it a few weeks ago as I thought it was causing the issue.\n\nIt used to work well for me, but then I stopped doing skincare for about a year due to the habit breaking. I’ve been doing it again now for ~2.5 months, and my skin has gotten worse after doing it. My moisturizer and cleanser are not expired as they’re new. I get most of the breakouts on my left cheek. That is the most sensitive part of my face, and I don’t think it has to do with sleeping position, face touching, etc as it’s also the only part of my face that will have marks where the pimple was. These marks only go away after a couple months. \n\nI know my skin type is very sensitive, dry skin. What could be causing this break out? Any recommendations on how to fix this?

Use cold water to wash most of the conditioner out, and wrap in a microfiber towel to dry for a few minutes. Apply Olaplex. Apply sports gel (just on the very ends of my hair), Scrunch in curl lotion and let it sit for a few minutes. Then I scrunch in my mousse thoroughly everywhere, and squeeze the rest of the water out of my hair while applying. If it's still feels super wet, I pat with the microfiber towel a little bit. Then I dry with a defuser, hanging my head upside-down, with heat on low, forever.\n\nI've been reading the wiki and learned that the dew point is probably the biggest factor, but I'm still researching. Any help, product suggestions, and advice is very appreciated!\n\n  \nEdit: had the picture order wrong",

The past couple months I've noticed that I'm starting to get acne, but I really didn't think it was bad until I tried to take a photo of some earrings I was wearing and got jumpscared by my own cheeks (yes, the face ones!) My biggest complaint is the acne on my cheeks, but the whitehead situation on my chin is also a bother.\n\nThe only skincare/routine I use is nightly hydrating Olay daily facials water activated dry cloths. Occasionally I use Green glowup cream by tovegan. I do wear makeup 4–5 days a week, using CC cream rather than foundation.\nI have a Nexplanon implant; I'm not sure if the new hormones could be contributing to this.\n\nI'm very embarrassed by these photos but I need a solution. I know this isn't *super* severe, but as someone who has always had quite clear skin, this is definitely affecting me. Going to a dermatologist is not an easy option for me at this time, so I'd like to exhaust any advice from you guys before I consider it. Extra points for budget options.\n\nThanks so much for listening to my rant and possibly sending some advice my way.",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?
