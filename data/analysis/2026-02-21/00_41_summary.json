      "content": "After 20 years of straightening (I was so insecure about my hair due to sexist and racist comments my ex's mom made constantly, actually), I chopped my hair off in September 2024! That's where the pictures begin. After struggling to get a good hair cut, I finally found my curly cut girl in a friend who had just finished an intensive course on curly hair (pic 8).\n\nBy convincing me to go back to short, she saved me and I have felt gorgeous and cool af since. I'm growing it out now, I want a short bob as shown in pic 5 (you can't tell the back was a hot mess) just because I think it really highlights the beautiful silver of my hair and shows off I have ridic telephone cord curls. Honestly, I know I'll cut it short again, probably before it gets long enough to call a bob lol!\n\nIt took too long, but I am so glad I finally got fed up with trying to mimic white beauty standards when I'm a proud Puerto Rican. I feel like me 100% and I see a beautiful, whole person who owns herself when I look in the mirror. I look like my mom again and that is so comforting. I feel sexy and I must be because I get beau coups of attention now, when before my unnatural hair just didn't suit me (I see that now). I am so happy.\n\nMy mom always tells me to not get so emotional over my hair, but it's been a source of pain my whole life. I have been harassed, touched against my will, had my hair yanked, had many people make racist comments, the list goes on. I am reclaiming my beauty now. No one can tell me anything other than \"you have beautiful curls!\" and \"your silver is amazing!!\" or I'll Miss Piggy karate chop them—hiiiiii-yah!!!!! I am so proud of myself for removing what was a huge thorn in my side.\n\nRoutine: I use the tgin rosewater collection. Shampoo, conditioner, leave-in mixed with a little castor oil, then hair lotion. I twist then scrunch, then let air dry and scrunch/fluff it again for body.",

      "content": "Hi,\n\nWe went to a dermatologist the other day, and he recommended either the Ducray Kelual DS hair shampoo or the Vichy Dercos shampoo (Serbian company, really good shampoo from the reviews I've read online).\n\nNow, he has given me antibiotics and a retinoid for my skin, as well as some other stuff. He was explaining how the skin of my scalp impacts my forehead acne and that I need a specific shampoo to fix that (I don't know how that works). My father, on the other hand, is clinging onto the fact that my dermatologist wants to make my dandruff go away, and while yes that is true, that's not the only thing he wants me to buy THOSE specific shampoos for. My father told me that he has some $3 anti-dandruff shampoo, and after looking into it, that won't fix my forehead acne problem. No matter how hard I tried to explain and how many resources I pulled, he wouldn't budge.\n\nOf course, the obvious solution to this would be getting a job and spending my own money on skincare, but there's personal reasons why I can't get a job, so that's out of the picture.\n\nThank you in advance. :)\n\nEDIT: The clinical analysis says: **Papulopustular acne with closed comedones, Dx: Acne vulgaris.**  \nHopefully that helps.",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I'm in need of some advice or product recommendations; primarily conditioner and 1-2 styling products. For the last 3 years I have been on an exhausting journey to find truly fragrance free products that make my curls look, at the very least, decent-ish. I have very fine hair that is prone to frizz and without products with a lot of slip, my hair looks like an absolute mess. For a long time I was using Innersense I Create Volume and it gave me the most gorgeous, smooth, shiny, well-defined curls of my life. Sadly, due to contact allergies I had to stop using it. I have tried so many products and have switched back and forth because the reviews were so positive, but my experience with them was very much lacking.\n\n  \nCurrently, I don't have a very set routine as I have been cycling in and out of products, but this is what I am currently using:\n\n1. Shampoo 1x a week (more or less as needed) with SEEN shampoo.\n\n2. Condition daily with Ouidad Unbreakable Bonds Fragrance-Free conditioner (pretty sure I'm allergic to this and will be removing it from my routine)\n\n3. Apply SEEN Curly Cream and Color WOW Dream Coat for Curly Hair. \n\n4. Scrunch out excess water and plop in hair towel before air drying. \n\n  \nThis routine is kind of meh and only about 50% of the overall satisfaction I'm looking for, but its the best I've come up with so far. As far as other products I've used, its as follows:\n\n  \n\\* VaniCream/Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and Conditioner -- Shampoo completely stripped my hair and I had to use an enormous amount of the conditioner to keep my hair soft.\n\n\\*VaniCream/Free &amp; Clear Styling Gel -- Way too heavy even in small amounts. Left my hair limp and crunchy even after scrunching all day. \n\n\\* Innersense Clarity Shampoo and Conditioner -- Worked really well but ended up being allergic to it. \n\n\\* LOVE UR CURLS 3-in-1 Styling product -- Too sticky and left my hair frizzy and limp. \n\n\\* Curlsmith Fragrance Free Conditioner -- Definitely NOT fragrance free. Contained allergens. \n\n\\* SEEN Conditioner -- Again, had to use a bunch of it to achieve a desirable effect. \n\n\\* SEEN Hair Serum -- Even one drop mixed in with other products left my hair greasy. \n\n\\* Color WOW Dream Coat -- Truly fragrance free and helped with frizz, but it left my hair a bit shapeless on its own. \n\n\n\nWhat I have recently tried but have yet to fully incorporate into my routine:\n\n\\* The Ordinary Behentrimonium Chloride 2% Conditioner -- Read a lot of revies about how it was very high slip and made curls look great. However, my experience has been that it is NOT high slip and didn't leave my hair very soft. \n\n\\*FRAGFRE Styling Gel -- Read that it was a very strong hold and to water it down. Tried it straight and cut with other products. Either way the application of it left my hair limp and very... poofy? \n\n\n\nPlease help. ",

I understand that diet is important for general skin health but my diet has been quite alright and basically the same since the last 3-4 years, no major changes.\n\nI have been struggling with acne , although mild but recently flared up quite badly, and i am really looking for a scientific based routine that is shown effective to treat acne, i am tired of experimenting with otc products all the time with little to no improvement.\n\nNow i wonder if it is even worth it to consider another dermatologist or just give up on my acne ever clearing. Are dermatologists in india like this ?? Or is it just my luck with these specific ones. I’m really feeling hopeless and need advice about this, should i find a different dermatologist??\n\nI’m 21F, had acne since 14–15.",

We come from different parts of the world and have very different skin so I'm totally lost in what his skin would need.\n\nHe never had a good skin care and he has big sensory issues with the feeling of cream on his face (autism) and has already a hard time with washing and moisturizing every day (ADHD) so it can't be something too complicated. \n\nFor some details on his skin : he is a Mediterranean man in his 20's, grew up under the hot sun of Sicily with almost no sun screen so that probably didn't help his skin, he has some acne sometimes if not careful but nothing too serious and his skin gets oily quickly (especially on the parts that are touched by his hair). Overall he has a very nice olive skin that just needs a simple enough routine to keep the acne away and help with the oiling while keeping it moisturized. \n\nDo you have recommendations of nice simple products that would work with his needs ?
