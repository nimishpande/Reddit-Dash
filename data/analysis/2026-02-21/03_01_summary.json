      "content": "After 20 years of straightening (I was so insecure about my hair due to sexist and racist comments my ex's mom made constantly, actually), I chopped my hair off in September 2024! That's where the pictures begin. After struggling to get a good hair cut, I finally found my curly cut girl in a friend who had just finished an intensive course on curly hair (pic 8).\n\nBy convincing me to go back to short, she saved me and I have felt gorgeous and cool af since. I'm growing it out now, I want a short bob as shown in pic 5 (you can't tell the back was a hot mess) just because I think it really highlights the beautiful silver of my hair and shows off I have ridic telephone cord curls. Honestly, I know I'll cut it short again, probably before it gets long enough to call a bob lol!\n\nIt took too long, but I am so glad I finally got fed up with trying to mimic white beauty standards when I'm a proud Puerto Rican. I feel like me 100% and I see a beautiful, whole person who owns herself when I look in the mirror. I look like my mom again and that is so comforting. I feel sexy and I must be because I get beau coups of attention now, when before my unnatural hair just didn't suit me (I see that now). I am so happy.\n\nMy mom always tells me to not get so emotional over my hair, but it's been a source of pain my whole life. I have been harassed, touched against my will, had my hair yanked, had many people make racist comments, the list goes on. I am reclaiming my beauty now. No one can tell me anything other than \"you have beautiful curls!\" and \"your silver is amazing!!\" or I'll Miss Piggy karate chop them—hiiiiii-yah!!!!! I am so proud of myself for removing what was a huge thorn in my side.\n\nRoutine: I use the tgin rosewater collection. Shampoo, conditioner, leave-in mixed with a little castor oil, then hair lotion. I twist then scrunch, then let air dry and scrunch/fluff it again for body.",

      "content": "I (21F) used retinal for the first time on Monday - I have pretty dry skin and have issues with getting some tiny white spots along the jaw, occasional breakouts and some dullness. I wanted to get started on a retinoid to get my skin used to it. I have never really used one before aside from BOJ retinol eye cream inconsistently a few years ago, but after some research, felt retinal seemed right.\n\nI could only afford the inky list advanced retinal as a student which is a 2% cream (I know... thats high). I've done the sandwich method to make up for this strength as best as possible.\n\nSince my first use, I have been breaking out some more along my jaw and lower cheek area and little on my forehead. I have planned to use it only once a week in the evening for now, with the sandwich method:\n\n\\- I wash my face with the cerise hydrating face wash, then tone with the TONYMOLY Mochi Toner, followed by either a super simple Nivea soft cream or a random facial cream I have from Lidl.\n\n\\- wait for that to absorb for 30 mins to an hour\n\n\\- apply a little bit of retinal\n\n\\- moisturise again and then follow with the KOSE ceremiaid cream which locks everything in.\n\nI wanted to ask if there was anything I am doing wrong , and any changes I should make to this routine. Is my purge typical of a retinoid purge? What kind of acne or breakout is it? I can't really afford to purchase new products, so I do want to make this work! Am I on the right track?\n\nThank you!\n\n",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I searched around a bit and found \"La Roche Posay Anthelios Uvmune Oil Control Fluid SPF50+\". \n\n\nIs this a good daily sunscreen (especially when using retinol and exfoliators) or do you recommend something else? \nAlso, is my routine good?

They're gentle and have been amazing, it's perfect for me and there's been such improvement.\n\nNow, the issue I'm posting about has only been present for the past 2-3 weeks. It'll be HOURS after I've done my routine, but whenever I cry, my cheeks starting burning and become irritated.\n\nThis has never been an issue before for me, which I know some people naturally have that stinging sensation... I don't. So I can only wonder if it's due to my new routine? All of my products are alcohol-free, as well.\n\nCould this be related to my new routine (albeit, a very late reaction)?

I’ve read that niacinamide shouldn’t be used with Vitamin C so I don’t know whether to put it in the morning or at night.\n\nAlso, I was considering adding a **multi-peptide serum (with copper peptides)** at some point, but then I read that copper peptides shouldn’t be mixed with Vitamin C either… so now I’m confused about layering and what cancels what\n\nAnd one more thing: I have **dark circles that I have NEVER managed to fix**.

I proposed to get into a good skin care routine so we put all chances on our side to have a nice skin for our wedding day. We come from different parts of the world and have very different skin so I'm totally lost in what his skin would need.\n\nHe never had a good skin care and he has big sensory issues with the feeling of cream on his face (autism) and has already a hard time with washing and moisturizing every day (ADHD) so it can't be something too complicated. \n\nFor some details on his skin : he is a Mediterranean man in his 20's, grew up under the hot sun of Sicily with almost no sun screen so that probably didn't help his skin, he has some acne sometimes if not careful but nothing too serious and his skin gets oily quickly (especially on the parts that are touched by his hair). Overall he has a very nice olive skin that just needs a simple enough routine to keep the acne away and help with the oiling while keeping it moisturized. \n\nDo you have recommendations of nice simple products that would work with his needs ?
