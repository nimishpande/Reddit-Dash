But for the last 4–5 years, it’s mostly on my chin and around my lips. I also developed worst papular scars. I tried CO2 laser also but I didn’t see much difference in raised scars.\n\nI was on isotretinoin last year and that was the only time my skin was truly clear. Even my scars looked better. After I finished the course, my skin stayed good for 4–5 months. Then slowly everything started coming back.\n\nMy skin reacts very badly to humidity and summer. It becomes extremely oily and then I get painful breakouts again. Every acne leaves dark pigmentation. It feels like a never-ending cycle.\n\nI’m honestly very tired now. It’s painful physically and mentally. Looking in the mirror is hard some days.\n\nEvery time I visit a dermatologist, they change my products. I feel confused and lost. I just want to control my acne first. I just want my skin to calm down.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar chin/hormonal acne, please share what helped you. Please tell me what helped you. Even small advice means a lot right now ♥️",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\nI recently saw an ad for an exfoliating scrub that claims to remove tan and dead skin cells, and it got me curious. My skin tone has become quite uneven, especially from tanning and some patches look darker and dull compared to the rest like neck, elbow, stomach and even arms too. Also my underarms are kinda dark but i am not so much insecure of them but still would love to try something that can help.\nHas anyone tried exfoliating scrubs that actually help with tan removal and evening out skin tone?\nIf yes, which ones worked well for you? Looking for honest recommendations.\nAlso, if you have suggestions on how often to use them and what skin type they’re best for, that would be really helpful!",

      "content": "Hi, 26F here. I have hormonal acne due to pcos, Hirsutism and as a result I always have folliculitis and clogged pores on my face. My cheeks are always red and my skin is always inflamed, PIH, PIE, skin texture. Cystic acne occasionally but mostly there's pus filled whiteheads and pustules always. \n\nI used to use MamaEarth products and they worked for me before, but then I read so many bad things about it, so I stopped using them. And then Minimalist was all over the internet. So I've been using Minimalist products for quite sometime now, maybe 3 years. But I have yet to see results. Then for the past few months I stopped using everything and focused only on CTM routine. I felt my skin could finally breath without the daily hectic skincare routine. \n \nI finally decided that I will stop giving in to the trends and products hyped and suggested by influencers and reviews by random strangers online and consult a dermatologist and focus more on internal healing, lifestyle changes and diet to be specific. But I gave in again because they were offering a free tote bag (I also have the glass bottle and for some reason I really like the idea of collecting merch hehe) and ended up buying stuff again.\n\nWhile scrolling saw that the Oil-free fluid light sunscreen which I was eyeing for a long time because no sunscreen suits me out of all that I tried, was available as freebie. Got this one as a freebie before and I liked it. It was free on Minimalist products along with the tote bag. So I ended up buying all these just to get the free sunscreen because I know it's stupid but I didn't want to spend 500 on a sunscreen again because I end up not using the ones that don't suit me.\n\nAnyways all of my serums were empty and so decided to buy everything one last time. Salicylic acid serum, 5% niacinamide serum, Vitamin C serum, Vitamin b5 Moisturizer - these are the stuff that I bought. I'm also using Tranexamic Acid for my PIH and PIE, and the Vitamin B12 Moisturizer occasionally.\n\nShould I have hope for these to work while I'm finally starting to improve my lifestyle and focusing on internal healing? I used to have a very sedentary and unhealthy lifestyle. So maybe that's why these didn't work before. \n\nTL;DR: Do Minimalist products actually work? Should I continue using them topically while working on my lifestyle to see changes? Have these products worked on someone with hormonal issues like pcos? \n\nAlso is that freebie actually 50ml. You can see in the picture, though it is not bright, the sunscreen is only half of the tube. Is that how it is normally or do they give products like these for free because they're free anyway and we're not paying for it? ",

I don't have much of a routine unlike other girls my age, and since I'm basically broke, I just use whatever off-brand shampoo that we have in the house, and for conditioner I usually use Tresemme, Aussie, or just whatever else I can find on sale. I don't really have the money to afford fancy hair products, but I have found that if I scrunch in a bit of Mark Anthony curl cream, plus NYM curl defining gel after I shower, they usually work to define my 2b 2c 3a curls for a little while, but I have to use sooo much of the products it's ridiculous and I feel like I'm wasting money. I don't have a diffuser or anything fancy, so usually I let it air-dry, or just put my hair in a bun or braid while it's wet, but as soon as it dries or I take it out of the braid it just turns into frizzy, undefined curls that you can basically see through, which is basically the opposite of what I want. It's still soft, but the curls just aren't together. At night, if it's not wet, I'll just sleep with it in a bun, but if it's wet, I'll just let it be and just air dry while I sleep. I don't have like a hair bonnet, silk pillowcase or anything like that, but I'm open to buying one if it would help. And in the morning I just usually do a braid, bun or ponytail, but I wish I wasn't so basic lol. My hair is super thick and long (like to my waist when it's heat straightened), and on the outside it's sort of wavy, while underneath it's super curly ringlets. Idek what's going on though because it frizzes super bad like right after it dries, and I need help because the rest of my family just has straight hair 😭. So these are some of the things that I was wondering:\n\n  \\- Are there any inexpensive products that work really well for defining frizz without being crunchy?\n\n \\- How can I make my curls be better defined (with or without product)?\n\nAlso idk just some random things like should I brush it or not, would cutting it help, should I sleep with my hair wet or dry, etc...?\n\nJust any hacks that I could use to make my curls frizz less and are much appreciated ❤ \n\n  \nTL; DR\n\nI (16 f)need help with my frizzy, undefined 2b 2c and 3a curls. any product recommendations, treatments, or just general curly hair life hacks would help 🙏",

      "content": "Hey everyone\n\nI'm 25F and I'm posting to seek some guidance from this amazing community regrading my acne. Sorry for the long post ahead. \n\nSo I started using tretinoin 0.05 back in August last year and likely destroyed my barrier. I never had acne before that and only started it for anti-aging but ended up with severe acne breakouts that just wouldn't end. I stopped tretonoin 1.5-2 months in but the breakouts continued to happen. I was prescribed Doxycycline 100mg in Jan this year by a dermatologist. It helped reduce the number of new pimples I would get but I was still getting them every 2-3 days.\n\nI finally started using differin gel last week (started at twice a week and have only used it thrice now). I haven't gotten any new pimples this week although I do know it might be too soon to tell if differin is actually working. \n\nI visited another dermatologist today and she straight up prescribed Spironolactone 50mg daily and oral isotretinoin 20mg daily for 3 months. Now I'm very concerned b/c isn't this too aggressive and I've always thought of isotretinoin as the last resort treatment for acne? I'm also concerned if the dermatologist was one of those who puts everyone female with acne on isotretinoin and Spironolactone. \n\nFor further context, I have PCOS (have had menstrual irregularities all my life but NEVER acne: in fact, I would always be complemented for my clear skin) and AGA (currently on oral minoxidil 1.25mg daily). Mind you, the dermatologist didn't know I have pcos (I know I'm dumb....I completely forgot to mention for some reason).  \n\nMy questions: \n 1. I know you all aren't dermatologists but from lurking on this sub, I know you all are very knowledgeable in skincare. I would really appreciate your opinion on whether such an aggressive treatment is really necessary. Or should I just take the plunge since its just 3 months anyways? \n\n 2. Should I consider taking only one of Spironolactone and isotretinoin or both? I'm not very keen on Spironolactone b/c I already pee a lot and don't want to have to pee all the damn time. \n\n 3. Should I just continue differin for a while and see how that works or would that be a waste of time? I've also been thinking adding some chemical exfoliation once a week (I have Paula's choice 2% BHA exfoliant)\n\n 4. If I do take isotretinon, I'm aware of the short term side effect of extreme dryness but are there any long term side effects to using it? \n\nI've attached pictures of the current state of my acne here. \n\nI'm sorry again for the long post but I'd really appreciate any advice! Thankyou so much! ",
