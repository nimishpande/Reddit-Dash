I’m wondering whether it’s a curly cut or if anyone knows which way she cuts her hair? Also I know that her hair isn’t freshly styled and probably multiple days in\n\nMy routine consists of herbal essence shampoo and conditioner and I detangle in the shower. I don’t usually style my hair (I braid it in a protective hairstyle) but when I do I just go in with the Marc Anthony curl cream + the mousse, umberto giannani gel and diffuse my hair upside down and occasionally I’ll put a claw clip while I diffuse at the top for more volume. I wear a silk bonnet to sleep. Also, my hair wet reaches my upper thigh so it’s pretty long",

      "content": "I have \\*very\\* dry, sensitive skin most of the time, so usually the main focus in my routine(s) is staying hydrated. I’ve tried LOTS of different creams/lotions, serums and oils but so far these fellas have been the most effective. everything mentioned is fragrance free and should be safe for sensitive skin (potentially minus the last if you’re really sensitive to niacinamide!)\n\n1. I know hyaluronic acids are a bit overrated now but if you’re still gonna incorporate one into your skincare I recommend this one. it’s got not just HA but also panthenol AND glycerin so lots more extra moisture than just HA on its own.\n\n2. I really like Goldbond products, but normally only use their creams (especially the eczema relief one). this lotion though is like a beautiful hybrid baby of lotion \\*and\\* cream. she is THICK but not greasy which is a rarity in my experience. it lasts all day for me even in the winter.\n\n3. this is probably the second most expensive skincare product I’ve ever bought ($27-29 I think? not expensive in the grand scheme of skincare but expensive for me lol) but boy oh boy, is it worth it. it is 30% glycerin. yeah, THIRTY. I apply a pump or 2 of this on damp skin at night after GM’s hyularonic acid and it is SO hydrating. definitely gives you a bit of a glass skin look as cliche as that sounds at this point lol. only negative I can think of is that it’s a lil bit sticky/tacky.\n\n4. I have heard NO ONE talk about this product yet on here and I don’t know why. it is an AMAZING lightweight cream that’s literally formulated by an actual dermatologist. it’s super moisturizing and helps to repair your skin barrier w/ ceramides, squalene and glycerin. it even has a cool lil push down lid that dispenses the exact amount you need everytime :) the only “bad” thing is is that it does contain a little niacinamide IIRC, so if you’re sensitive I’d probably avoid!",

I’ll use a bit of this on the ends of my hair.\n\nI’ve been trying the curly hair method and these are the products I use:\n\nCantu curl cream \n\nJohn frieda dream curl mousse\n\nEco olive oil gel \n\nWhen doing a curly routine I wash my hair and apply conditioner then leave in conditioner.\n\nThen I apply the curl cream and mousse in sections and follow up with the gel and scrunch. I squeeze the water out of my hair with a T-shirt then I use a diffuser to dry my hair. At the end I’ll use that argan oil to break the get cast\n\nI’ve only tried the curly hair method a few times but my hair is always so frizzy still and idk how to fix it. \n\nDo I need more hydrating products or protein products?\n\nAlso should I use hair oil and which hair oil would you recommended?\n\nI heard brushing your hair when it’s dry with a brush causes frizz, so should I wet my hair every day and brush? Wouldn’t that cause breakage?\n\nI have way too many questions lol\n\nI appreciate anyone who can give me some answers :)",

My favorite for a LONG TIME was from Suave, but it has a grey cast. Tried Batiste for dark hair and I love it but the dark coloring makes my hands look dirty if I've been touching my hair. Tried the Not Your Mother's plump for joy dry shampoo and it's about as good as the Suave, but also has the grey cast. Beginning to care less about the grey cast since it can be fluffed out a bit.\n\nI really wanted to like the IGK, I wanted to treat myself to it, since it's expensive compared to others.   \n**But it makes my hair feel so unbearably dry and grippy** that I immediately want to wash it out. I've never had a dry shampoo I immediately wanted to wash out. I even tried spaying it with rose water to re-hydrate it and then brush it out after.\n\nSomeone help 😭 Please, who has a good dry shampoo suggestion that works but doesn't feel so dry and chalky? It feels like it makes my hair very prone to breakage after using it.",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine?

With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

What treatment or maintenance procedure can I do every week or two weeks to successfully “remove” my sebaceous filaments and trichostasis spinulosa every time they re-appear (I know these never go away, they are a part of my personal pore anatomy, I just want to aesthetically manage them thoroughly).

I used it consistently, so I can say it worked significantly for my acne marks and gives a very nice glow immediately after washing off.\n\nNot for beginners.\n\nNot using it in winter as I am using tretinoin since December 2022, and in winter because of dryness I didn’t dare to irritate my skin more with acids.\n\nBut as summer is approaching, I will definitely repurchase this.10/10\n\n\n2) Salicylic acid serum: \n\nThe only salicylic acid serum I tried.\nUsed 2 bottles of this. Takes time but definitely works.\n\nSinks in seconds, water-like texture.\n\nAs I have minimised my whole skincare routine, I will not repurchase.7.5/10\n\n\n3) Niacinamide serum: \n\nUsed two bottles but I don’t think niacinamide works that great for acne and acne marks.\n\nI was using this with tretinoin, so I don’t know what to rate this and I don’t think this alone can help.\n\nHas a runny, not so slimy texture.\nSinks well on damp to wet skin.\nFoams up a little bit, I think that’s pretty normal.\n\nWill not repurchase, not this and not from any other brand because using tretinoin alone is doing enough work for me.6/10 \n\n\n4) HA oil free moisturizer: \n\nNot enough moisturizing for my tret dry skin.\nGel cream texture.\nToo sticky if I don’t use it on damp skin.\nThankful that at least it didn’t give me any CCs. 6.5/10\n\n\n5) Derma Co Nia Ceramide moisturizer (dry &amp; sensitive skin version): \n\nWorked well for winter dryness with tretinoin, but I used this whole bottle without realising that this was actually the product giving me CCs all over my cheeks like crazy (yeah, maybe I was dumb).0/10\n\n\n6) Derma Co Nia Ceramide daily hydrating moisturizer: \n\nMe, my mother and my sister tried it.\nDidn’t suit 3 of us at all, it itches and gives rashes.\nBut I gave it to my friend and she actually liked it.\nFor context, she has normal skin type, so do my sister and mother.\nShe does not have acne issues like me, only gets 1 to 2 pimples occasionally, but it suited her well and she said she will repurchase.\n\nAt this point I think this moisturizer has a beef with our genes.\n\nBut I will still rate it 0/10.\n\n\n7) Derma Co sunscreens (pore minimizer, aqua gel, and vitamin C + niacinamide version): \n\nUsed 6 to 7 bottles of this.\nIt was the beginning of my skincare journey, so it’s a canon event, ifykyk 😮‍💨 \n\nOverall, The Derma Co has been very hit or miss for me. I’ll only repurchase their peeling solution. My current skincare is working fine for me, so I’m not experimenting further.\n",

I saw a derm back in November who seemed to not explain anything and was in a rush to get me out the office. She prescribed me a stronger treat (0.05), kojic/tranxemic acid. I was already using azelic acid for a year, Peroxide wash, was already taking spirnolactone and these all weren’t helping but she told me to continue.\n\nI tried the same office again with a different doctor not on purpose I actually could not find the first doctor I went to and don’t know where she went. And I’m hoping these products are the one cause I’m so tired and defeated by my acne. Im not even asking for completely clear skin but to stop waking up with new pimples every single day. \n\n\\[acne\\]\n\nCurrently she has for me \n\nAM: Sulfacetamide Sodium Wash followed by Amzeeq, lotion and sunscreen\n\nPM: Tretonoin 0.05, kojic acid.
