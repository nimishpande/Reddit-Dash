I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

But for the last 4–5 years, it’s mostly on my chin and around my lips. I also developed worst papular scars. I tried CO2 laser also but I didn’t see much difference in raised scars.\n\nI was on isotretinoin last year and that was the only time my skin was truly clear. Even my scars looked better. After I finished the course, my skin stayed good for 4–5 months. Then slowly everything started coming back.\n\nMy skin reacts very badly to humidity and summer. It becomes extremely oily and then I get painful breakouts again. Every acne leaves dark pigmentation. It feels like a never-ending cycle.\n\nI’m honestly very tired now. It’s painful physically and mentally. Looking in the mirror is hard some days.\n\nEvery time I visit a dermatologist, they change my products. I feel confused and lost. I just want to control my acne first. I just want my skin to calm down.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar chin/hormonal acne, please share what helped you. Please tell me what helped you. Even small advice means a lot right now ♥️",

My skin tone has become quite uneven, especially from tanning and some patches look darker and dull compared to the rest like neck, elbow, stomach and even arms too. Also my underarms are kinda dark but i am not so much insecure of them but still would love to try something that can help.\nHas anyone tried exfoliating scrubs that actually help with tan removal and evening out skin tone?\nIf yes, which ones worked well for you?

      "content": "Sorry for the long paragraph in advance, but here goes: \n\nSooo I'm a teenager (16F, caucasian if that helps), and a few years ago when I went through puberty my hair went from light waves to whatever craziness it is right now, and I'm not sure how to handle it. I don't have much of a routine unlike other girls my age, and since I'm basically broke, I just use whatever off-brand shampoo that we have in the house, and for conditioner I usually use Tresemme, Aussie, or just whatever else I can find on sale. I don't really have the money to afford fancy hair products, but I have found that if I scrunch in a bit of Mark Anthony curl cream, plus NYM curl defining gel after I shower, they usually work to define my 2b 2c 3a curls for a little while, but I have to use sooo much of the products it's ridiculous and I feel like I'm wasting money. I don't have a diffuser or anything fancy, so usually I let it air-dry, or just put my hair in a bun or braid while it's wet, but as soon as it dries or I take it out of the braid it just turns into frizzy, undefined curls that you can basically see through, which is basically the opposite of what I want. It's still soft, but the curls just aren't together. At night, if it's not wet, I'll just sleep with it in a bun, but if it's wet, I'll just let it be and just air dry while I sleep. I don't have like a hair bonnet, silk pillowcase or anything like that, but I'm open to buying one if it would help. And in the morning I just usually do a braid, bun or ponytail, but I wish I wasn't so basic lol. My hair is super thick and long (like to my waist when it's heat straightened), and on the outside it's sort of wavy, while underneath it's super curly ringlets. Idek what's going on though because it frizzes super bad like right after it dries, and I need help because the rest of my family just has straight hair 😭. So these are some of the things that I was wondering:\n\n  \\- Are there any inexpensive products that work really well for defining frizz without being crunchy?\n\n \\- How can I make my curls be better defined (with or without product)?\n\nAlso idk just some random things like should I brush it or not, would cutting it help, should I sleep with my hair wet or dry, etc...?\n\nJust any hacks that I could use to make my curls frizz less and are much appreciated ❤ \n\n  \nTL; DR\n\nI (16 f)need help with my frizzy, undefined 2b 2c and 3a curls. any product recommendations, treatments, or just general curly hair life hacks would help 🙏",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

Typically texture (congestion?) on my forehead, smaller zits and blackheads on my temples and sides of my face, and large/deep zits on my jaw and cheeks. My skin is very dry and easily irritated. I see a dermatologist and currently use Tretinoin 0.1% every other night and clindamycin gel and the Ordinary’s azelaic acid suspension 10% in the morning. This routine doesn’t seem to be helping. I typically rinse my face with water in the morning, apply the prescribed creams and moisturizer (i use first aid beauty’s ultra repair cream). At night i double cleanse with miscellar water and a CeraVe cream-to-foam cleaner for dry skin and then apply tretinoin and lotion. Once a week I use a benzyl peroxide face wash (also cerave 4%) and derma plane, and occasionally apply raw vitamin e oil at night. Any suggestions/improvements to my current routine are welcome!",

I’ve started noticing wrinkles around my eyes and dark circles too, and honestly I look way older than 24 right now. My skin isn’t sensitive at all so I’m down to try strong stuff if they actually work. I’ve attached a pic so you can see the tan and the eye situation.
