      "content": "I’m reaching out for some advice. Lately, I’ve noticed that my hair isn’t curling as well as it used to, even though I’m using the same products and have the same routine (gel or foam). I go to a hairdresser who specializes in curly hair.\n\nNow I’m confused because I’m not sure whether my hair just doesn’t curl the same way anymore, or if it’s simply too long (although I’ve had long hair before, and it used to curl better) or it’s not cut correctly. \n\nI’ve always had the issue that the bottom layer of my hair hardly curls at all – it’s more wavy than curly. When I get a layered haircut, that bottom part tends to stick out, making the difference between the curly and wavy sections even more noticeable. This is why I don't like very layered cuts. When my hair is shorter, the curls are more defined, but the bottom layer still stays wavier.\n\nI don’t know what would be best – to change my hairdresser, cut my hair shorter, change my routine or just accept that my hair doesn’t curl the way it used to or something else?\n\nEdit: my routine: I change shampoo and conditioner a lot, I brush my hair in the shower and then apply Tootilab Styling gel and then in between drying it with a diffuser a spray PoulMitchell Sculpting Spray. As somebody mentioned - I indeed started with new medication (oral contraceptive) two years ago. I was also thinking this could be a reason why my hair curls less (when I was a kid I had completely straight hair, they started curlying in puberty- so maybe hormonal changes does affect my hair a lot).

Each week I’m battling really painful inflamed pimples that almost always leave deep hyperpigmentation and my forehead is littered with it. What can you all recommend for this? I’ve tried spearmint tea, prescription azelaic acid 15%( seemed to work for a couple of months but progress slowed)glycolic acid, salicylic acid and more to help with this but they’ve all failed. I just ordered stratias mandelic acid 10% and hoping for a miracle but am losing hope. I rarely get cysts on my forehead just the inflamed ones. I get cystic pimples on my chin around my cycle as well too.

I’ve experienced some irritation and dryness, so I’m looking tips about these. My Routine: Benzoyl Peroxide &amp; Clindamycin Gel: 3 days a week Adapalene 0.1%: On the other days, E.g monday for benzoyl, tuesday for adapalene etc. I don’t use the products one day a week to rest my skin. Cleanser: Gentle, for sensitive and dry skin Moisturizer: contains glycerin, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and squalane Sunscreen: SPF 50 Hada Labo (only when I go out) Early Impressions: Benzoyl Peroxide &amp; Clindamycin Gel: Last time when I used that, I felt burning for couple minutes, maybe I put too much of product. Otherwise I Had some redness and dryness, so I skipped a night and used Madecassol to calm it down. It helped a lot. Adapalene: I think the peeling I’m experiencing is from Adapalene. My skin feels drier and flakes a bit after using it. I tried Sandwich method with moisturizer but it doesn’t seem to help. Questions: Irritation: Has anyone experienced redness or irritation like this? Should I use the combo gel less often or is this normal at the start? Dryness/Peeling: How do you manage peeling from Adapalene without slowing progress? Sunscreen: I’ve been using SPF 50 Hada Labo when I go out, but any other sunscreen recommendations for this routine? Any advice or personal experiences would be super helpful! Thanks!",

She even listed all the products so I could get them and recommend substitutes. So here is my current routine, the same routine she gave me to get these curls. 1)Wash: I use shea moisture shampoo and conditioner with warm but not hot water. 2) Style: I go section by section with a leave in, (curls smiths), a gel (innersence) and the wet brush. I can’t describe the motion I do with the brush but it s like brushing and twisting it at the same time. 3) Dry: She used a salon grade dryer but recommended I use a diffuser but not touch my hair with it just hover around it until it’s completely dry. 4)Serum: I break the gel cast with innersence serum. She was very specific about using a serum not an oil. I do all of this but my curls never come out like hers. Am I missing a step? Mine come out very frizzy no solid or strong curls. ",

      "content": "First picture is my hair today after doing my normal routine that has been giving me pretty good hair days up until today. I recently switched back to Aussie's miracle curls shampoo and conditioner after trying other products (Shea Moisture, hated it, Paul Mitchell extra body, meh) and found that my hair was shiny again which I liked. I wonder though if my hair is flat today because of a build up of silicones or maybe I just used too much product after? The other pictures are how my hair has usually been looking. What I'm asking is, when your hair is flat and awful on wash day, would you just start over by clarifying or do you leave it be until the next wash so it can recover? How should I fix this so my hair isn't weighed down and dull again tomorrow?\n\nWhether I have washed or am just refreshing my hair, my routine has been to get it completely soaking wet and scrunch in NYM curl cream, put NYM mousse on the ends, and diffuse to dry before scrunching it out.",

I didn't visit any dermatologist for this; I knew what they would prescribe me and the expensive products. Being a teenager, not only do I not earn much (and that too is sometimes I do, sometimes I don't), but also I didn't want my parents to spend a luxury for my skincare. So I did my research, or whatever you'd like to call it, and started using my savings to purchase all these products one by one from a generic pharmacy. \n\n**Slide 1: Prior to May 17, 2025**  \nAM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra\n\n**Slide 2: Prior to August 26, 2025, till Sept 2, 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: AcMist  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nActive: Adapalene 0.1%\n\n**Slide 3: From Sep 3 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC (Using this as a moisturiser base provides better sun protection.)  \nActive: Azelskin - Azelaic Acid 10%  \nSunscreen: FixDerma Shadow SPF 30 (cheap and gets the job done for me)\n\nIn-between AM/PM (occasionally only if I am at home):  \nCleanser: Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC  \nActive: HQ 4%\n\nElse not at home:  \nSunscreen reapplication\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Minimalist B5 10% Moisturiser  \nActive: Melapik (0.0125% tretinoin, 2% HQ, 1% allantoin) **// Not a steroid cream**\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\nYes, I am aware of the ochronosis risk using HQ. But cycling it, 2 months use (alternative) and then stopping for a few weeks and then starting again will keep the melanocytes sensitive. So I will not encounter any of it, as most side effects happen due to long-term abuse without any protection and carelessness, and I am not at all careless.\n\nAll of the supplements I take are within the safe limits; I will mention the dosage and the frequency in the comments.\n\nI am looking forward to starting microdose isotretinoin. \\~7 mg / day.  \nEven weeks: 20 mg Thrice  \nOdd weeks: 20 mg twice\n\nAvg weekly intake: 50 mg\n\nWill be monitoring my lipid and liver panels every 3-4 months and ensuring they are within the ideal range.\n\nAny review and insights would be helpful.\n\nThank You",

      "content": "TL;DR - long post but essentially what can i add into my routine, already take fin and min still seems like no progress.\n\nSo for context im 23, noticed some slight thinning at 18 got it checked out, derm said its mpb and prescribed min. started min around then and tbh if im being honest ive not religiously done it twice a day. at first it was once a day everyday. then for a while i mightve stopped. but for majority of it i have been doing once a day but recently (for the past 6+ months itll be once every other day with the occasional everyday streak). I just find min so annoying it ruins the texture of my hair, gives me dandruff, makes it unstylable unless i shower and i have diffuse thinning so i cant rly apply it to one specific spot i have to part my hair and apply it all throughout the scalp (atleast i think feel free to tell me otherwise).\n\nstarted 1mg fin in feb 2024 and ive been consistent taking it everyday. Didnt have any initial shedding in fact i feel like fin has reduced my shedding. Like all my life the amount of hair shed i thought was normal (under a 100 hairs a day but close to it usually) went down significantly. Also tmi but i definitely do feel like fin has made my semen more watery. Could argue that its reduced how many random boners i get by its been a year and a half since i started i can’t remember how horny i was on a day to day basis tbh and if it was anymore than i am rn then im happy having this level of control.\n\nBut essentially it seems like my hairs still getting thinner (or atleast not really improving at all) so i was wondering what i could change or add in. Ive heard dermarolling/dermastamping is good ?",

This is my hair after washing it and using no curl products (and drying naturally).\n\nWithout products, my hair won't curl properly, as you can see, its like most of my hair is nothing at all (not wavy, not curly, not straight) its just pure frizz and no definition, its actually worse than the picture shows, because some locks of hair are like this from the root to the edges (and in the picture, you can mostly see only the frizzy edges), specially those behind my head. \n\nAlso, I have A LOT of frizz all around the top of my head with the baby hairs, not even the \"New hair\" looks healthy.\n\nThis problem doesn't solve properly using curl products after washing it, like mousse and oils\n It gets much better but it fades fast and I wonder if im not \"forcing\" my hair into something it isnt, but I also feel my hair just isn't right, it feels like an unhealthy hair that can only be solved cutting fully. \nThere is also a mystery I cant solve that is the locks of hair right around my ears that are perfectly beautiful, they are curly, shiny and smooth, and all I can wonder is why the rest of my hair isn't at least 10% of it, what am I doing different or if its just born like that. \n\nI would like to know if anyone already experienced it or if thats just normal and if thats how it is. I searched on this subreddit about this topic but most of the pictures I've seen people had so much less frizz or just lacked a little bit or definition, while in my case its like most of my hair is like this. What could I do to solve it? Is it normal? \n(Routine/details: picture after washing it with Arvensis products - free petrolatum/parabens, but looks like this with any shampoo/conditioner. No after products, I wanted to see it without it. \nEdges cut one month ago. Hair looks beautiful when done in a curls saloon. I have no chemical treatments in my hair such straightning, colour change, bleach, nor use heat in any case, my hair doesn't fall much.\nI sleep with satin bonnet, my hair is mostly kept in a bun bcz its too messy naturally, wash max twice a week)",

Lately I’ve noticed a bit more thinning (nothing major) and wanted to add dutasteride into my regimen to hopefully add a little more thickness back into my hair.\n\nI started taking dutasteride weekly at .05mg, and when I say I’ve had shedding, I mean it. Hairs falling out all day, clumps in my hands during showers, massive amounts stuck in my comb, you get the picture.\n\nI see a lot of horror stories about people starting and their hair loss becomes much worse, and never improves again. I’ve also seen some anecdotes of others who tried dutasteride saying once they went off and back to solo finasteride, their hair grew back thicker with less shedding.\n\nI’m just creating this post to see if anyone here wants to provide their own experience with the drug and I can learn from that.\n\nThanks!",
