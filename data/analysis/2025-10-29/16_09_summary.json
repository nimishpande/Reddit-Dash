I don't drink and I don't smoke. \n\nI would like to know how to fix this : to get rid of the fuzzy hair but also to know how to hide it because it makes me look unkempt for work, even when I put my hair in a ponytail (with a loose scrunchie).\n\nThank you for your help !",

I didn't visit any dermatologist for this; I knew what they would prescribe me and the expensive products. Being a teenager, not only do I not earn much (and that too is sometimes I do, sometimes I don't), but also I didn't want my parents to spend a luxury for my skincare. So I did my research, or whatever you'd like to call it, and started using my savings to purchase all these products one by one from a generic pharmacy. \n\n**Slide 1: Prior to May 17, 2025**  \nAM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Salicylic 2% Face Wash Minimalist  \nMoisturiser: Moisturex Hydra\n\n**Slide 2: Prior to August 26, 2025, till Sept 2, 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: AcMist  \nSunscreen: Raystop SPF 30\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nActive: Adapalene 0.1%\n\n**Slide 3: From Sep 3 2025**\n\nAM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC (Using this as a moisturiser base provides better sun protection.)  \nActive: Azelskin - Azelaic Acid 10%  \nSunscreen: FixDerma Shadow SPF 30 (cheap and gets the job done for me)\n\nIn-between AM/PM (occasionally only if I am at home):  \nCleanser: Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Episoft AC  \nActive: HQ 4%\n\nElse not at home:  \nSunscreen reapplication\n\nPM:  \nCleanser: Simple Kind to Skin Gentle Cleanser  \nMoisturiser: Minimalist B5 10% Moisturiser  \nActive: Melapik (0.0125% tretinoin, 2% HQ, 1% allantoin) **// Not a steroid cream**\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\nYes, I am aware of the ochronosis risk using HQ. But cycling it, 2 months use (alternative) and then stopping for a few weeks and then starting again will keep the melanocytes sensitive. So I will not encounter any of it, as most side effects happen due to long-term abuse without any protection and carelessness, and I am not at all careless.\n\nAll of the supplements I take are within the safe limits; I will mention the dosage and the frequency in the comments.\n\nI am looking forward to starting microdose isotretinoin. \\~7 mg / day.  \nEven weeks: 20 mg Thrice  \nOdd weeks: 20 mg twice\n\nAvg weekly intake: 50 mg\n\nWill be monitoring my lipid and liver panels every 3-4 months and ensuring they are within the ideal range.\n\nAny review and insights would be helpful.\n\nThank You",

      "content": "Hi there! I wanted to first say that I understand there are likely lots of posts like these, but I wanted to ask myself, for I cannot find any posts or resources that are helpful.\n\nA few years ago, I began to transition from male to female. Over time, my mom has accepted me more, and she tries to support me in my endeavors, but she isn't the teaching type. Basically, I'm a girl with little to no real girl \"experience.\" I have no clue where to start with makeup, I don't know what I should mess with and try out to practice, and any attempts to search for beginner guides online results in more advanced concepts and hard-to-understand videos.\n\nI was hoping you guys could give me some assistance in finding some basic \"how to girl\" \"how to makeup\" guides or starting points. I'm basically asking for an emulation of that experience a lot of young girls have with mothers where they get to learn the *core basics* and *simple concepts*. If that makes sense.\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "Hi guys, I (17M) have been struggling for a bit more than a year now with acne and hyperpigmentation.\n\nIt all started with me popping my pimples, which led to darker brown marks appearing (I have a light brown skin tone). What was just a bit of acne at the beginning of puberty ended up becoming a nightmare for me.\n\nOver the years, looking at my face in the mirror was something really hard. Going outside and hanging out was also difficult.\n\nAt first, I tried some homemade treatments from my aunts, and‚Ä¶ nothing. I knew what they were giving me had no scientific proof that it would actually help my skin, but I was too desperate to give up.\n\nSo I saved a bit of money and started checking social media for ‚Äúbest skincare for this‚Äù or ‚Äúbest skincare for that.‚Äù Eventually, I found out I needed a proper skincare routine: cleanser, serum, moisturizer and sunscreen. Months passed and I started to notice a bit of change, but nothing exciting ‚Äî I‚Äôd even say almost nothing.\n\nSo this time, I went to a pharmacy, asked for products, bought some and started a new skincare routine. A few weeks later, my mom told me she had also gone to a pharmacy and asked for products for hyperpigmentation caused by acne, so I updated my routine by adding the products she brought me.\n\nSince that day, I‚Äôve gained more confidence even if im still mot comfortable for example when i take a photo of me or when someone talk about my face \nSo yeah, iv been using the same products. And, based on the first before/after photos I took, there is some change, but right now it feels like everything has become stagnant, and I‚Äôm not using what I really need anymore to get rid of the acne and hyperpigmentation.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm posting here ‚Äî to see how people with the same condition as me managed to get clearer skin.\n\nBy the way, here are the products I‚Äôm using so far:\n\nAM routine:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tGamarde - Sebo-Control - Purifying cleansing water\n\t‚Ä¢\tSVR serum (15% Azelaic Acid, Niacinamide + Zinc)\n\t‚Ä¢\tGamarde - Sebo-Control - Balancing fluid\n\t‚Ä¢\tGarancia SPF 50 sunscreen\n\nPM routine:\n   \n       ‚Ä¢\tGamarde - Sebo-Control - Purifying cleansing water\n\t‚Ä¢\tCeraVe PM Moisturizer",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
