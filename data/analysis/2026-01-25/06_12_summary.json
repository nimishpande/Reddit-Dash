      "content": "My skin has pores but not excessive, just minimal. I have T zone combination oily skin.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a medical professional. Any prescription products mentioned below are shared purely as my personal experience. Please consult a dermatologist before using any prescription medications or actives.\n\n1. Bioderma Atoderm Crème Ultra Moisturiser\n\nMy HG. I love this thing. It just works like a charm. Not going back to anything else for a while.\n\nI got it for ₹450 from Nykaa and bought it around 2 months back. Even though this is a bit heavy for oily skin type, I did not feel any issue to be honest. My skin texture improved and it keeps my skin well hydrated.\n\nWRP 10/10\n\n2) Melalumin Lip Balm\n\nNot a fan. Did not do that much.\n\nIt does keep my lips from getting chapped and gives SPF protection, but it did not do what it was supposed to do. Derm prescribed, but to be honest I already have pink lips and I was just too greedy to get them even lighter like a baby’s.\n\nSo yeah, cannot really give a strong opinion.\n\nWNRP 6.5/10\n\n3) The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\nI use it mainly under my eyes before I sleep and also on my lips. I know using actives on lips is a dumb move, but I did not have any issues.\n\nMy lips looked plumpy and pinkish as hell, so I am happy. I will buy it again for sure.\n\nI got it last April with another Ordinary product on a buy one get one offer, so it cost me around ₹300.\n\nWRP 8.5/10\n\n4) The Ordinary Niacinamide Serum\n\nI have heard it helps many people, but personally I did not feel a huge difference.\n\nYes, it did reduce the size of my pores, that I can say. But I did not feel like it regulated sebum or oil production. Still, fingers crossed and I might buy it again.\n\nWRP 7/10\n\n5) COSRX Blackhead Power Liquid\n\nI am being completely honest. It did not do anything to my face.\n\nI still have blackheads and it did not even reduce them a bit. I am really disappointed and I will not buy it again.\n\nWNRP 4/10\n\n6) Plix Vitamin C Serum\n\nOne word. Trash.\n\nDo not buy it. It is just marketing hype. I did not buy it myself, I kind of stole it from my sister.\n\nHard WNRP 2/10\n\n7) Emolene gel\n\nIt did work, but applying it and then a moisturiser felt like a hassle.\n\nSo I just mix it with my moisturiser and apply. I did not feel much difference compared to using it separately. You can even see how much I have squeezed the tube.\n\nIt did make my skin very plumpy and youthful, to be honest, even though I am only 21 😭\n\nWRP 8/10\n\n8) Glycolic Acid 12 Percent\n\nWhen I first bought this, I used it on my face and lips twice a week. Big mistake.\n\nI could feel my barrier breaking because it used to sting like crazy. I stopped doing that dumb stuff. Later, I started mixing it with my Vaseline body lotion and applying it on my arms and legs to reduce tan and other issues, especially around neck joints.\n\nIt does work.\n\nWRP for body use 7.5/10\n\n9) Boraline\n\nHG.\n\nIt costs around ₹120 and is super multifunctional. I use it on pimples and they go away very fast. I also use it on wounds and cuts.\n\nNothing more to say. Just get it.\n\nWRP 11/10\n\n10) Beauty of Joseon Under Eye Cream\n\nI am not at a stage to give a full review yet. It has only been around one and a half months.\n\nI can see a bit of change, but using it every day hurt my barrier around the eyes. Now it is kind of reddish. I already had this condition before, but it worsened.\n\nI met a derm and she said it is something similar to dandruff and gave me Emuosome gel. I am not seeing changes yet, but I hope it fixes it.\n\nI would still give this a 6/10.\n\nBefore trashing me in comments saying I did not check my under eye issue, I already did enough analysis. Mine is largely due to genetics and hollow under eyes, and I needed a retinol based under eye cream.\n\nMaybe WRP 6/10\n\n11) Tretinoin 0.05 percent\n\nThis has been a lifesaver for me personally, but this is a prescription medication and should only be used under dermatological guidance.\n\nI was introduced to it after proper research and medical consultation. It is the most repurchased product in my routine, and I personally feel it has helped my skin texture and overall appearance over time.\n\nThat said, tretinoin is not for everyone. It can cause irritation and barrier damage if used incorrectly, which is why starting with a lower concentration and following a dermatologist’s advice is very important.\n\nThis is not a recommendation, just my experience.\n\nPersonal rating based on my usage 11/11\n\nWRP 11/11\n\n12) Laneige Lip Balm Berry\n\nI forgot to add it in the picture because it is finished and I threw it away.\n\nBut man, this thing is so good. The best lip balm I have ever used. It is expensive, ₹600 for a tube is diabolical, but it does the job really well.\n\nI got three for ₹600 during an Amazon glitch and sold some to friends, so I actually made money back 😂\n\nUsing it overnight makes so much sense. Vaseline dries off by morning, but this stays.\n\nWRP 10/10\n\n13) Vaseline Lip Therapy Pink Tin\n\nIt is good. I got it for ₹76 from JioMart.\n\nIt is better than regular Vaseline because it is thicker and stays longer. It also has a slight pink tint, which does not influence much but still shows a bit.\n\nWRP 7/10\n\n14) Regular Vaseline\n\nI mainly use it on wounds that are already healed but the skin is not fully recovered yet, just to give some moisturising effect.\n\nI also use it on my eyebrows and eyelashes and occasionally on lips. I have really long eyelashes, like very long, and around 2018 they started feeling lifeless. Since then I started applying a bit of Vaseline whenever I can.\n\nStill thankful for this hack. My lashes are long, curly, and healthy. People literally stare and comment.\n\nWRP 9/10\n\n15) Vaseline Body Lotion\n\nI got it from Flipkart for ₹176 back in March 2024 and still half the bottle is left.\n\nWhen I use it regularly, my skin starts to feel heavy and I do not like the texture. Recently I started using it again because of winter dryness. It also has SPF.\n\nIn the morning I use it on my hands and feet. At night I mix it with glycolic acid and apply on darker or tanned areas.\n\nWRP seasonal 6.5/10\n\n16) Neutrogena Sunscreen\n\nI have a controversial opinion. It is good.\n\nIt is not for my skin type, but I still use it because of price to performance. It stings my eyes badly and gives a reddish hue around them. That is why I switched to Minimalist Light Fluid.\n\nIt gives a slight white cast but settles later.\n\nWNRP 7/10\n\n17) Minimalist Light Fluid SPF\n\nI do not think it lives up to its name.\n\nIt still feels heavy, similar to Neutrogena but slightly lighter. It works and cost me ₹400, so no major complaints. No white cast for me.\n\nWNRP 7/10\n\n18) Re’equil Sunscreen\n\nCheap and good.\n\nSame issue with slight redness around eyes, which I think is a me problem. It works well and does not leave a heavy white cast. ₹300 is a good price and there is no overhyped marketing.\n\nI have used Re’equil for a long time.\n\nWRP 8/10\n\nCleansers\n\nI usually use Re’equil Glycolic Acid Face Wash. If I come back from football or gym, I use the Neutrogena cleanser that I got free with the sunscreen.\n\nBoth cleanse well. Cleansers are not going to do magic like ads show. If a cleanser cleans without being harsh, that is enough. Both were fine for me.\n\nEarlier I was using the Re’equil oil cleanser. It was okay but not great. I personally felt the glycolic acid one worked better.",

Sorry in advance for any unclear photos (I’ll also post this in a few curly/wavy subs).\n\nI’ve always had wavy hair, and around this time last year I fully cut out silicones and started loosely following CGM. My hair is waist-length and I usually air dry it.\n\nLately I’ve noticed that as my hair dries, it’s starting to separate into small sections on its own. At the moment it’s mostly happening on the underside, but I’m guessing it might spread as time goes on. Some of the sections are quite tight, others looser — it almost looks like I’ve twisted my hair into tiny sections and then left it to set.\n\nThey end up looking kind of like ropey curls, which I actually really like. These photos are from just water (from memory) but I'll put my usual routine in the comments.\n\nIs this something that can happen as hair gets healthier / more hydrated? And if so, is there a way to encourage this pattern without manually twisting sections?",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I wet my hair every day, brush it when it's wet and then apply this right before I get out of the shower and wrap it in a hair towel for about five minutes, then I let it down and comb it with a wide-tooth comb.\n\n3. I let my hair dry on its own, I never use a hair dryer.\n\n4. As I mentioned, I brush my hair in the shower. When I wash it, I brush it with the conditioner on to de-tangle. And I always sleep with my hair down. \n\nAny advice on what I should change/do differently is greatly appreciated! \n\nAlso, I live in South America, so there might be a fair amount of good curl products not available here.

I’ve had them since I was a baby, so I’m guessing it’s genetic. \n\nThey always appear sunken-ish but also a bit puffy at the same time. When I’m super tired they become super super puffy and they get puffy when I smile too. When I wear makeup they are still very visible circles/dents. Looking up or to the side makes them very visible too. \n\nI am 23 years old. I’ve tried guashaing them, caffeine de-puffing serum by the ordinary, eye patches of all sorts, and so much more. I use retinol, rhode glazing milk, lotion, and wash my face with cerave (and am now switching between that &amp; panoxyl) as skin care if that makes a difference. I’ve consider undereye filler to improve the sunken circle look, but they are sunken and puffy at the same time so I don’t think that’d help (like the circle itself sinks in and then inside the circle it’s puffy? I guess is the best way to explain it or how I see it). \n\nAny advice/tips/etc would be so appreciated!!! ",

      "content": "Please help me, as I'm someone who is completely clueless when it comes to skincare. I'm getting ready to turn 28, and I recently discovered that I have crows feet that I hadn't noticed before. Just for full context, I never did any skincare previously. I'd wash my face at the end of the night, but I kid you not, it was just with a dove bar of soap. I know that's probably heinous, but that's what I used because my skin always seemed oily as a teen and a bar of soap was less likely to make my skin break out. I never did any lotions, creams, or anything until recently, but I feel completely clueless with where to start.\n\nI don't want anything that will make me break out if I can help it, because I still get acne on my chin (especially if I'm stressed out). For a while I was doing the Neutrogena Hydro Boost gel cream, but realized that this is just meant to moisturize my skin, and I'm worried that isn't exactly meant to prevent wrinkles. I have a few moisturizers that I've tried, and I recently decided to get my first anti-wrinkle cream.\n\nI picked up Loreal Revitalift and it wasn't until I got it home I realized it said it's sunscreen. Although I'm a redhead and understand that it's more important for me to wear sunscreen than others, I work remotely and almost never go outside. Would this even be beneficial for me to be wearing? I want to a product that will prevent wrinkles that won't make me break out and won't cost a fortune. And I also don't want to buy 30 different products to achieve this goal, because I've already acquired several different products for what feels like all for nothing. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",
