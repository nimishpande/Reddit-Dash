      "content": "I honestly have to share this because I was about two days away from just chopping all my hair off. For the last few months, my curl pattern has been completely undefined, just mushy, frizzy, and refusing to clump, no matter how much gel I used.  \n  \nI realized my old products were probably stripping my hair too much, so I decided to look into Japanese haircare since I heard they use milder surfactants. I picked up the BOTANIST \"Smooth\" line (the Green Apple &amp; Rose one) because I was specifically looking for an organic shampoo for women that balances protein and moisture without being heavy.  \n  \nThe difference after just two washes is actually insane. The shampoo feels really gentle but still lathers well, which is rare for sulfate-free stuff.  \n  \nHere is the full breakdown of how I managed this wash day:  \n  \nFor the wash, I used the BOTANIST Botanical Shampoo (Smooth) - I focused really heavily on massaging the scalp to make sure I got all the buildup off without stripping the lengths. I followed up with the matching BOTANIST Treatment, applying it generously from the ears down. I detangled with my fingers and used the \"squish to condish\" method to really push water into the hair shaft until it felt like seaweed.  \n  \nFor styling, I kept it simple to test the shampoo's effect. I applied Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in using the \"prayer hands\" method on soaking wet hair, then scrunched in a good amount of LA Looks Blue Gel to form a cast. I micro-plopped with an old cotton t-shirt for about 10 minutes to stop the dripping, then diffused on low heat until it was 100% dry.  \n  \nTo maintain this overnight, I sleep on a satin pillowcase with my hair up in a loose \"pineapple\". If I need a refresh on day 2 or 3, I usually just mix a little water with the leave-in in my palms and glaze it over any frizz halo.  \n  \nI'm just so relieved to see my definition back without that gross, dry feeling!",

Sorry in advance for any unclear photos (I’ll also post this in a few curly/wavy subs).\n\nI’ve always had wavy hair, and around this time last year I fully cut out silicones and started loosely following CGM. My hair is waist-length and I usually air dry it.\n\nLately I’ve noticed that as my hair dries, it’s starting to separate into small sections on its own. At the moment it’s mostly happening on the underside, but I’m guessing it might spread as time goes on. Some of the sections are quite tight, others looser — it almost looks like I’ve twisted my hair into tiny sections and then left it to set.\n\nThey end up looking kind of like ropey curls, which I actually really like. These photos are from just water (from memory) but I'll put my usual routine in the comments.\n\nIs this something that can happen as hair gets healthier / more hydrated? And if so, is there a way to encourage this pattern without manually twisting sections?",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I am surprised by this as I would’ve thought it would’ve been during my teenage years but looking back at photos of myself at 14-18 I actually had very mild-humored skin. I am now getting very angry (almost cystic) acne on my face, and only really on the sides of my cheeks/jawline area and not so much my T-Zone.\n\nI am looking for any and all advice, I suspect it’s hormonal as it’s usually at it’s worse 1 week BEFORE my period comes and usually calms down during my period. However it has never been so bad as of now, with my getting deep and painful cysts that released green puss (from one of them).\n\nAlso- what is driving most crazy outside of the painful acne, is the fact my face is so textured- not bumpy- crunchy!!! The whiteheads come to the surface and harden up, leaving many mini dry scabs that cover my problem zones.\n\nAny advice welcome- my current skincare is Byoma Acne face wash, glow recipe BHA exfoliator, the ordinary serum for acne treatment, and ilia face milk/heavy cream (not together just when needed) as moisturizer.\n\nThanks for reading",
