It's not expensive and it's made with natural ingredients only. \n\nWhen we shower, we rub it on our body (never the face) and let it sit for 3-5 minutes. Then, we rinse it and we rub our body with a glove called Kiessa The amount of dead skin that this technique removes from the skin is crazy. Then, your skin is soft like a baby's and you just have to moisturize it. We do this once a week.\n\n \n\nI always marvel at the fact that non african-middle-eastern-(or any culture that uses black soap) don't know that this incredible product, that is fairly cheap, exists and how incredible it is for their skin. Which makes me wonder, what other incredible skin or beauty hacks in general, from other countries exist and simply have no idea? \n\nPlease share your culture skin care-hair hack that works super well with us!",

      "content": "I honestly have to share this because I was about two days away from just chopping all my hair off. For the last few months, my curl pattern has been completely undefined, just mushy, frizzy, and refusing to clump, no matter how much gel I used.  \n  \nI realized my old products were probably stripping my hair too much, so I decided to look into Japanese haircare since I heard they use milder surfactants. I picked up the BOTANIST \"Smooth\" line (the Green Apple &amp; Rose one) because I was specifically looking for an organic shampoo for women that balances protein and moisture without being heavy.  \n  \nThe difference after just two washes is actually insane. The shampoo feels really gentle but still lathers well, which is rare for sulfate-free stuff.  \n  \nHere is the full breakdown of how I managed this wash day:  \n  \nFor the wash, I used the BOTANIST Botanical Shampoo (Smooth) - I focused really heavily on massaging the scalp to make sure I got all the buildup off without stripping the lengths. I followed up with the matching BOTANIST Treatment, applying it generously from the ears down. I detangled with my fingers and used the \"squish to condish\" method to really push water into the hair shaft until it felt like seaweed.  \n  \nFor styling, I kept it simple to test the shampoo's effect. I applied Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in using the \"prayer hands\" method on soaking wet hair, then scrunched in a good amount of LA Looks Blue Gel to form a cast. I micro-plopped with an old cotton t-shirt for about 10 minutes to stop the dripping, then diffused on low heat until it was 100% dry.  \n  \nTo maintain this overnight, I sleep on a satin pillowcase with my hair up in a loose \"pineapple\". If I need a refresh on day 2 or 3, I usually just mix a little water with the leave-in in my palms and glaze it over any frizz halo.  \n  \nI'm just so relieved to see my definition back without that gross, dry feeling!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

      "title": "Why At-Home IPL Doesn't Work for Dark Skin [Hair Removal]",
      "content": "Edits for clarity\\*\n\nHi, everyone! I’ve noticed that there are sometimes questions about at-home IPL devices and recommendations for those with darker skin (Fitzpatrick IV or higher). I recently went down a major rabbit hole into the physics of photoepilation when I was trying to find a device for myself and am sharing in case it helps anyone else.\n\n*Wavelength (i.e. \"color\" of light)*\n\nPhotoepilation works because certain wavelengths of light are attracted to melanin and when the light reaches said melanin, the energy gets converted to heat. Dark hair has a ton of melanin and skin usually does not, so the light can \"cook\" the hair without totally burning you. However, because darker skin has more melanin, it has much more heat to dissipate. This is what leads to an uncomfortable experience and even burns and other side-effects for those with darker skin. IPLs are especially bad for this because the wavelengths of light that they emit are especially prone to being absorbed by skin instead of getting to the hair root to kill the follicle.\n\n*Fluence (i.e. the device \"power\")*\n\nSome of the newer high-end IPL devices claim to be safer for dark skin, but what they are actually doing is throttling the device fluence when treating darker skin so as not to burn the user. To permanently destroy a follicle, you need a certain fluence threshold, and for most people that threshold is 5-6 J/cm² at the absolute minimum (though in many cases, it's more). Most IPLs can get to around 6-7 J/cm² at their maximum settings. However, if the device is throttling its fluence, you aren't getting to that minimum fluence threshold for permanent (or even semi-permanent) results. Lower fluences are not just ineffective, they can also be harmful because they can sometimes stimulate more growth instead of less (paradoxical hypertrichosis).\n\n*Pulse Duration (i.e. length of device flash)*\n\nThere has been a lot of newer research about this, especially for treating darker skin. As stated before, since your hair has a lot more melanin than skin, it absorbs more heat and gets hot enough to kill the hair follicle. However, hair is also better at \"trapping\" heat than skin. The idea is that a longer but slightly weaker pulse can allow dark skin to cool down while the hair increasingly gets hotter across the duration of the pulse. This works great for coarse hair, however the catch is that it doesn't work nearly as well for fine hair; since fine hair has a lower quantity of melanin by virtue of being smaller, it doesn't get as hot. It can be boiled down to: the finer the hair, the less hot it gets and the easier it loses heat to the surrounding skin, making the treatment less effective. For manufacturers, this results in a need to compromise between being able to treat darker skin vs. finer hair. Instead of engineering devices with longer pulses (which, by the way, is expensive and bulky), manufacturers often stick to shorter pulses that work better for their \"average\" consumer. The only way they can treat their darker-skinned consumers is by reducing the fluence (see above). *EVEN IF* this leads to some hair shedding, it isn't as effective for permanent results and the hair is far likelier to come back.\n\nI'm not saying that IPL doesn't work at all; there are tons of stories of happy customers with pale, hair-free skin. What I am saying is that if you have a darker complexion, you may want to skip IPL and go with something else.\n\nTLDR; IPL is not for dark skin, save your money. If you have a darker complexion, IPL is far likelier to burn you OR be ineffective.\n\nI wrote a more detailed breakdown of the physics and include cited sources [here](https://scienceoverfluff.substack.com/p/why-ipl-doesnt-work-for-dark-skin) if anyone is interested.\n\n***Disclaimer:*** *While the article I linked doesn't have affiliate links, I want to be transparent that other articles on my platform sometimes do.*",

I use an african net sponge to exfoliate. After the shower, I apply generic body oil (not well versed in that world yet) as well as Fresh &amp; Cozy Body Lotion. Then body sprays/perfume. \n\nI’m not sure if there is anything I could use to help with strawberry skin/slight hyperpigmentation; please give me suggestions if youve found something that works lol\n\nDoes anyone have any good product recommendations?

Sorry in advance for any unclear photos (I’ll also post this in a few curly/wavy subs).\n\nI’ve always had wavy hair, and around this time last year I fully cut out silicones and started loosely following CGM. My hair is waist-length and I usually air dry it.\n\nLately I’ve noticed that as my hair dries, it’s starting to separate into small sections on its own. At the moment it’s mostly happening on the underside, but I’m guessing it might spread as time goes on. Some of the sections are quite tight, others looser — it almost looks like I’ve twisted my hair into tiny sections and then left it to set.\n\nThey end up looking kind of like ropey curls, which I actually really like. These photos are from just water (from memory) but I'll put my usual routine in the comments.\n\nIs this something that can happen as hair gets healthier / more hydrated? And if so, is there a way to encourage this pattern without manually twisting sections?",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m looking for advice because I honestly have no idea where to start with my hair.\n\nI recently did a big chop (first image). My hair used to be mid-back length, but it was very damaged, so I cut it shorter to try and start fresh. I have not created a routine at all yet so I am unable to provide one I’ve been mix matching between creams, mousses, gels, oils and leave-ins trying to find something that works. The first picture is no product but it is diffused to the best of my ability. I hover dry for 15 minutes and pixie diffuse for another 5 minutes until completely dry. Other than that I use head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner as this is the only thing that has seemed to work for me.\n\nI’ve had curly and frizzy hair since I was a kid, but it was never really taken care of properly. Both my parents have straight hair, so no one really knew how to manage curls. It was almost always brushed out and pulled into a low ponytail or slicked-back ponytail, which definitely didn’t help.\n\nOn top of that, I started using heat on my hair every day from around age 13, and I’ve only just recently stopped at 21, so I’m sure that contributed a lot to the damage and loss of curl pattern.\n\nWhen I was younger, I did actually have spiral curls, and even recently my hair can still form curls, but they feel inconsistent and hard to maintain.\n\nI also went to a hairdresser for my 21st birthday hoping to get my curls styled and shaped properly, but it was honestly a terrible experience. Their website advertised curl-focused styling, but they barely put effort into defining or styling my curls, and the result didn’t reflect what I was hoping for at all (second image).\n\nRight now my biggest struggles are frizz, flat roots with no volume at the scalp, curls forming more on the ends but looking limp or weighed down at the top, and not knowing whether I should focus on moisture, protein, lighter products, or something else.\n\nEverything I’ve tried so far seems to either weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy and undefined.\n\nIf anyone has advice on how to help curls become healthier, how to get volume at the roots, what kind of routine or products might suit fine to medium curly hair, or even just where to start when you’ve never really learned curl care, I’d seriously appreciate it. Also I’m from Australia, so preferably Aussie products!\n\nAny advice is welcome because I feel pretty lost and overwhelmed. Thanks so much!",
