The last one is the most recent one! \n\nMy routine essentially just consists of double shampooing with head and shoulders shampoo and just any old hydrating shampoo, and the conditioner I use is Sukin Hydrating Conditioner. Then I brush style in the shower, make sure not to disturb the clumps, then once I'm out of the shower I add in Garnier Aloe Vera leave in conditioner and Hask curl cream. After that I scrunch with a t shirt and plop it until it's about 50-60% dry, before adding in the Cake curl scrunching jelly and then leaving it to air dry the rest of the way. I don't brush once I'm out of the shower and I typically wash my hair every 4-5 days :)",

      "content": "TLDR: listened to my mum's advice on hair. Regret.\n\nSo I only went to this salon because my mum reccommended it, and she and my sister were going and we had somewhere to be. But I had a bad feeling about it because it was a small salon in a shitty area, and, most of all, it was my mum's idea.\n\nContext: I've got curly hair, around 3b curls, and fine. Mum also has curly hair, but it's looser curls, mostly waves which disappear after she puts it in a bun- and she has NO idea how to deal with curly hair. She's the type to think if I just 'take care of it', it will just magically turn straight. And that it being out curly is \"messy\". Yeah, that type.\n\nAnyway, we had somewhere to be and my mum was kinda pressuring me into it and I thought, hey, I haven't had my hair done in AGES, and maybe I shouldn't be so prejudiced as to think a small business in a shit area ran by a middle aged auntie can't do anything a bigger salon can do. So I went. And yeah, my instincts were all correct.\n\nThe woman was very old school about hair, seemed to think that flat ironing curly hair was 'fixing' it (right up my mum's alley). Not a fucking drop of knowledge about curly hair. She reccommended a conditioner with non-water soluble silicones, then said my hair is \"thick\" and \"difficult\"- now I KNOW my hair and I KNOW that it is FINE- quite dense, yes, but fine. And DIFFICULT?? Tf?\n\nSo she first washed my hair twice, no problem, I do the same. She focused on my scalp the first time- but then on my mids and ends the next. Is that normal? It was a \"deep cleanse\" apparently, so it would've been quite harsh for my hair, especially as she didn't use a conditioner afterwards. She towelled my hair so it was half-dry- I noticed she used the same one on me as she did on my mum and sister and other clients, no washing it, no replacing it. Then she brushed my hair while blow drying- again, same comb she used on other clients, no washing or replacing it, just tugged off the hairs stuck in the bristles 🤢🤢. Didn't detangle starting from the bottom, didn't do it whilst it was wet, she just ripped through my damp hair with a very stiff comb (albeit wide-toothed comb) from top to bottom. I could literally hear my strands breaking, and a bunch of hair came out. Not to mention it fucking HURT. She said that the brush she was using was really good because it detangles hair well- yeah love, by ripping half of it out so you have nothing to detangle.\n\nThen came the actual straightening- NO heat protectant. And I did ask her about heat protectant, said I have one in my bag, and she just shook her head and said, \"no, no, no it's fine\". Um, okay. I know heat protectants don't completely prevent damage but you'd want to bloody minimize it, wouldn't you?? Then she proceeded to rip through it again with the stiff comb while straightening, and going over the same strands like a million times- I'm not exaggerating, she'd go over the roots like a dozen times or more before straightening the mids and ends. Again, NO heat protectant. Then no setting spray.\n\nAnd in the end, do you want to know how much it cost? Do you want to know how much the split ends and sore scalp cost? Do you want to take a fucking guess?\n\nONE. HUNDRED. FUCKING. POUNDS.\n\nAnd I wouldn't even be this fuming about it except, you know- IT LOOKED NO FUCKING DIFFERENT TO WHEN I STRAIGHTEN IT AT HOME. I must stress this. NO. BLOODY. DIFFERENT. Except for maybe the FUCKING LOADS of split ends I can see it in now.\n\nAnd I've had my hair straightened at a salon before, and it had turned out nice- better than when I straighten it at home, because that's why you go to a salon, to get something you can't do at home, DUH. It lasts longer, and it looks smoother- you know, less like you straightened it and more like you just have straight hair.\n\nBut this looked the exact same straight-but-poofy that I can get at home. And she said it would usually be £50 for straightening- still a bit steep if you ask me, considering the quality- but that because my hair is long and thick (it's not thick) and \"DiFfiCuLt\" it would have to be more. I'm pretty sure I just paid to be hate crimed???\n\nAll that damage, all those split ends, all that pain, and all that money... for FUCK ALL.\n\nAnd I was getting so happy because I've been taking care of my hair and it's grown so long. 🙃🙃🙃\n\nLesson learned: never listen to my mum about my hair again, and go to actual curly-friendly salons.\n\nObligatory routine information: Wash with shampoo and conditioner once a week, clarify and deep condition once a fortnight, leave-in conditioner and serum and protective hairstyle like braids.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

Perfect Balance 8:2 matcha hydrating foam cleanser, a 47 Skin anti blemish serum (that i apply occasionally), a moisturizing cream i got from walgreens, and vaseline to help with dryness. and it surprisingly has worked better than most of the things ive tried. \n\ni started maybe early december and things got a lot better for a while, and i was feeling hopeful by early january (2nd pic, my skin was dry there and i wish i had a better pic but i swear it was better). however, as you can see in the last pic, things have gotten worse again. i’ve been on my period for the past 7 days so I believe this may be a contributor to my recent flare up, but i’ve still been feeling conflicted. it’s a little better than november (1st pic, which isn’t even the worst my skin has been) but my progress seems to be reversing.\n\nduring december, i went to a doctor soon after starting the routine and i was prescribed birth control and tretinoin to help me, but i haven’t started it yet because i noticed the routine might actually be improving my skin so ive been holding off. ive been scared of the side effects plus  my routine was working so why should i start? however, this new flare up has really been discouraging me. now im thinking maybe i should just start the birth control. it feels like a last resort and idk maybe my flare up was temporary and i should just keep my routine going and see where it goes? is that wishful thinking? will it just continue to get worse? additionally, i’ll be traveling to a convention in 6 months and i would really love for my skin to be improved by then so i have no idea which avenue to take. i’ve asked people and they said i should start the birth control (especially my mom who is adamant i start it), and some say i should just hold off on it and continue my routine bc the flare up is temporary and my skin is responding well to the routine. but im unsure. my skin has never worked with me and i have so many doubts about both paths to take. i just need some kind of assurance. what do i do? does anyone have advice for me?",

      "content": "Hello, l've had acne for the past 2 years (23F), I don't know why it started but it did. Before that I never had to use any special products as l've had unproblematic skin and had no reason to have a skincare routine of any sorts, I only used micellar water for cleansing and a moisturiser when i remembered/needed. I've been using sunscreen religiously since childhood because of skin cancer in my family.\n\nWhen my acne first developed I thought it was weird but i guess i was too busy to get into it. A friend who had acne previously recommended the La Roche Posay purifying foaming gel and i've been using it for the past 2 years. I would say it managed to clear my skin pretty well, to the point where I had rarely any new breakouts and could focus on healing the scars on my cheeks the acne left behind - which i did with 2 laser sessions in winter 2024 and 1 in winter 2025.\n\nHowever, about 3 months ago I started to get new breakouts and my skin is as bad again as it was 2 years ago. Roughly around the same time the acne came back I had started taking biotin for hair growth and I read that can cause breakouts so about a month ago i stopped but the acne is still here.\n\nBesides the biotin i didn't really change or add any new skincare around the time of acne reappearance.\n\nHowever, i keep getting new pimples almost daily and they stick around for a while.\n\nMy current routine is very minimal:\n\nAM: no facewash, beauty of joseon spf50+ (been using it for 4+ years) and if my skin feels dry during the day then alverde anti-age ultra sensitive daycream\n\nPM: LRP purifying foaming gel, alverde moisturiser, occasionally LRP cicaplast\n\nI would guess my skin is combination, with acne on the cheek and chin, never forehead, my diet is vegetarian with a decent variation of veg and fruits, and I’m physically active.\n\nMy question is, I live in the Netherlands and getting a referral to a dermatologist is nearly impossible and overall my gp won't take my skin concerns too seriously so prescriptions are off the table. Are there any OTC products I could try to heal this long term?",

The texture also looks rough.\n\nI consulted a dermatologist and was advised to use a moisturizer. I’ve already tried multiple brands including Cetaphil, Dermaco, and Epilyno (dermatologist-recommended), but I’m still seeing no real improvement.\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this?\n\n\t•\tWhat was the actual cause in your case?\n\n\t•\tDid anything other than basic moisturizers help?\n\n\t•\tWas it dermatitis, fungal infection, allergy, or something else?\n\nI’m not looking for a diagnosis, just real experiences or routines that worked. It’s making me feel quite insecure, so any input would really help. Thanks 🙏",

      "content": "\nHello!! To preface this- I’ve been an Esthetician for almost 3 years. This all started about 4 months into school.\n\nI started developing these small, papule type acne lesions around my hairline and jawline. I initially started by switching products (hair care, laundry detergents, makeup products, and skincare) nothing helped. I started making cuts in my diet, gluten, sugar, and dairy. But had never had issues with my diet or gut health before. No changes.\n\nI’ve seen 4 dermatologists now and have been prescribed doxycycline, spironolactone, metro gel, dapsone cream with Tret, dapsone with niacinamide, differin, sulfa cleanse, and clindamycin. (Not all at once) All of them say that this is just acne, my last appointment they wanted to put me on accuntane. \n\nI’ve considered the possibility that this could be acne rosacea, or even PIE. My current skincare routine consists of professional grade products that focus on calming and soothing. \n- Circadia Vitamin Veil Cleanser\n- Vani cream cream cleanser \n- chrono calm (Circadia)\n-Post Peel Balm (Circadia)\n-Light day sunscreen (Circadia) \n\nI’m just at a complete loss, if anyone has any advice, or has seen anything like this before I would love your opinion!! Thank you in advance :) ",
