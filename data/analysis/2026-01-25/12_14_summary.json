Then I brush style in the shower, make sure not to disturb the clumps, then once I'm out of the shower I add in Garnier Aloe Vera leave in conditioner and Hask curl cream. After that I scrunch with a t shirt and plop it until it's about 50-60% dry, before adding in the Cake curl scrunching jelly and then leaving it to air dry the rest of the way. I don't brush once I'm out of the shower and I typically wash my hair every 4-5 days :)",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "TLDR: listened to my mum's advice on hair. Regret.\n\nSo I only went to this salon because my mum reccommended it, and she and my sister were going and we had somewhere to be. But I had a bad feeling about it because it was a small salon in a shitty area, and, most of all, it was my mum's idea.\n\nContext: I've got curly hair, around 3b curls, and fine. Mum also has curly hair, but it's looser curls, mostly waves which disappear after she puts it in a bun- and she has NO idea how to deal with curly hair. She's the type to think if I just 'take care of it', it will just magically turn straight. And that it being out curly is \"messy\". Yeah, that type.\n\nAnyway, we had somewhere to be and my mum was kinda pressuring me into it and I thought, hey, I haven't had my hair done in AGES, and maybe I shouldn't be so prejudiced as to think a small business in a shit area ran by a middle aged auntie can't do anything a bigger salon can do. So I went. And yeah, my instincts were all correct.\n\nThe woman was very old school about hair, seemed to think that flat ironing curly hair was 'fixing' it (right up my mum's alley). Not a fucking drop of knowledge about curly hair. She reccommended a conditioner with non-water soluble silicones, then said my hair is \"thick\" and \"difficult\"- now I KNOW my hair and I KNOW that it is FINE- quite dense, yes, but fine. And DIFFICULT?? Tf?\n\nSo she first washed my hair twice, no problem, I do the same. She focused on my scalp the first time- but then on my mids and ends the next. Is that normal? It was a \"deep cleanse\" apparently, so it would've been quite harsh for my hair. She towelled my hair so it was half-dry- I noticed she used the same one on me as she did on my mum and sister, no washing it, no replacing it. Then she brushed my hair while blow drying- again, same comb she used on my mum and sister, no washing or replacing it, just tugged out the hairs in it 🤢🤢. Didn't detangle starting from the bottom, didn't do it whilst it was wet, she just ripped through my damp hair with a very stiff comb (albeit wide-toothed comb) from top to bottom. I could literally hear my strands breaking, and a bunch of hair came out. Not to mention it fucking HURT. She said that the brush she was using was really good because it detangles hair well- yeah love, by ripping half of it out so you have nothing to detangle.\n\nThen came the actual straightening- NO heat protectant. And I did ask her about heat protectant, said I have one in my bag, and she just shook her head and said, \"no, no, no it's fine\". Um, okay. I know heat protectants don't completely prevent damage but you'd want to bloody minimize it, wouldn't you?? Then she proceeded to rip through it again with the stiff comb while straightening, and going over the same strands like a million times- I'm not exaggerating, she'd go over the roots like a dozen times or more before straightening the mids and ends. Again, NO heat protectant. Then no setting spray.\n\nAnd in the end, do you want to know how much it cost? Do you want to know how much the split ends and sore scalp cost? Do you want to take a fucking guess?\n\nONE. HUNDRED. FUCKING. POUNDS.\n\nAnd I wouldn't even be this fuming about it except, you know- IT LOOKED NO FUCKING DIFFERENT TO WHEN I STRAIGHTEN IT AT HOME. I must stress this. NO. BLOODY. DIFFERENT. Except for maybe the FUCKING LOADS of split ends I can see it in now.\n\nAnd I've had my hair straightened at a salon before, and it had turned out nice- better than when I straighten it at home, because that's why you go to a salon, to get something you can't do at home, DUH. It lasts longer, and it looks smoother- you know, less like you straightened it and more like you just have straight hair.\n\nBut this looked the exact same straight-but-poofy that I can get at home. And she said it would usually be £50 for straightening- still a bit steep if you ask me, considering the quality- but that because my hair is long and thick (it's not thick) and \"DiFfiCuLt\" it would have to be more. I'm pretty sure I just paid to be hate crimed???\n\nAll that damage, all those split ends, all that pain, and all that money... for FUCK ALL.\n\nAnd I was getting so happy because I've been taking care of my hair and it's grown so long. 🙃🙃🙃\n\nLesson learned: never listen to my mum about my hair again, and go to actual curly-friendly salons.\n\nObligatory routine information: Wash with shampoo and conditioner once a week, clarify and deep condition once a fortnight, leave-in conditioner and serum and protective hairstyle like braids.",

I got a recommendation from a friend to use curl cream then a mousse then optional but a anti frizz cream after that. Unsure as to what brands are good though especially for the mousse and anti frizz. I have low porosity 2C/3A hair anddd goals are for my hair to have more definition and less frizziness, not much hold though!\n\nRoutine: Wash 1-2 a week, I use tsubaki shampoo and conditioner and then a few drops of coconut oil (stopped now) after for frizz",

My routine is as follows (and was the same in the US minus the brush type and I used Kenra heat protectant spray):\n\n\\- Kerastase genesis heat protectant\n\n\\- Rough dry to 80-90%\n\n\\- Revlon oval voluminizer plus blow dry brush\n\n\\- Heated comb to style/smooth\n\n\\- Moroccanoil volume spray at roots if necessary\n\nAs of now with this routine in the UK my hair stays straight for maximum 1 day (sometimes less and curls during the day).\n\nCould it be that the T3 round brush gave my hair more tension than the oval revlon? Do I need an anti humidity spray? Just not sure what to change.",

      "content": "Please help me, as I'm someone who is completely clueless when it comes to skincare. I'm getting ready to turn 28, and I recently discovered that I have crows feet that I hadn't noticed before. Just for full context, I never did any skincare previously. I'd wash my face at the end of the night, but I kid you not, it was just with a dove bar of soap. I know that's probably heinous, but that's what I used because my skin always seemed oily as a teen and a bar of soap was less likely to make my skin break out. I never did any lotions, creams, or anything until recently, but I feel completely clueless with where to start.\n\nI don't want anything that will make me break out if I can help it, because I still get acne on my chin (especially if I'm stressed out). For a while I was doing the Neutrogena Hydro Boost gel cream, but realized that this is just meant to moisturize my skin, and I'm worried that isn't exactly meant to prevent wrinkles. I have a few moisturizers that I've tried, and I recently decided to get my first anti-wrinkle cream.\n\nI picked up Loreal Revitalift and it wasn't until I got it home I realized it said it's sunscreen. Although I'm a redhead and understand that it's more important for me to wear sunscreen than others, I work remotely and almost never go outside. Would this even be beneficial for me to be wearing? I want to a product that will prevent wrinkles that won't make me break out and won't cost a fortune. And I also don't want to buy 30 different products to achieve this goal, because I've already acquired several different products for what feels like all for nothing. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",

      "content": "**The issue and the story:**  \nHello! I'm 25 and I've been using the same skincare routine for around 5 years. My skin was always quite nice, when breakouts happened I knew why - too much sweets, my period, bad sunscream. But lately, it's been getting progressively worse. English is not my first language, so I'll do my best here:\n\nI have a lot of red dots, small red patches on my cheeks, jaw, forehead. They don't always turn into full blown pimple with yellow tip. The skin is also generally more red. You can see them on a photo - I know it is not the end of the world, it just happened quite suddenly and I want to control it before it gets worse. It is also more intense in coulour that photos show.\n\nWhat changed? Well, my boyfriend dumped me 6 months ago and it was well... quite sudden and traumatic. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, lost hair, all package. So yeah, immense stress - but as I said, it was some time ago.  \nHovewer, I am crying every two days. So that is my first suspect - could crying and rubbing face cause the irritation?\n\nSecondly, I started working out. So maybe more sweating than before caused this?\n\nNo other changes happened - the same products, same city (water in pipes), I wash bedding and towels as often as before.\n\nWhat do You think? Could my suspects cause it? Or maybe it is just time to look for new products? Or idk, buy silk bedding?\n\n**Skin type:** oily in a T-zone, prone to dryness, probably combo\n\n**Current routine**: I've been using the same routine for about 5 years.\n\nMorning - Cetaphil Emulsion to wash my face, La roche-posay Toleriane sensitive creme for hydration, during sunny time I add sunscream (I know, I know, should be all year) - so latetely I haven't been using it, only when I used serum night before\n\nEvening - makeup remover tonic, Cetaphil Emulsion to wash my face again, La roche-posay Toleriane dermallergo nuit OR when I feel really dry Cetaphil lipoactive moisturizing cream. Since the problems appeared, I also use Effeclar serum from LRP - but changes on skin were first, not my usage of the serum. I use it a few times a week, after using it I add sunscream the next day.\n\nI don't use much makeup, only concealer and face powder, no foundation.\n\nI'm from Poland.\n\nThank Your for Your help!",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for experiences with UVB phototherapy (“hardening”) for sun allergy / PMLE.\n\nI have fair, sensitive skin and a history of neurodermatitis. As a child I had sun allergy, then it disappeared – but it’s been back for a few years now, mostly during vacations in southern countries. I get itchy rashes, especially at night, on arms/legs/neck.\n\nI’ve already tried:\n\n\t•\tsunscreens for sun allergy (Ladival, Nivea Sensitive)\n\n\t•\tHeliocare capsules (Polypodium leucotomos)\n\n\t•\tbeta carotene, calcium\n\n\t•\tdesloratadine daily\n\n\t•\tstaying in the shade\n\nBut nothing really helped – especially in Turkey. Mallorca was a bit better.\n\nNow my dermatologist recommended UVB phototherapy several times a week until summer to increase tolerance.\n\nHas anyone done this for PMLE?\n\n\t•\tDid it help?\n\n\t•\tWas it worth it?\n\n\t•\tDid the effect last beyond one summer?\n\nThanks in advance for any experiences! 🌞",
