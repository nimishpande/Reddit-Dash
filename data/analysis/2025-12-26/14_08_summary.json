      "content": "Hi everyone. About six months ago I posted here in a pretty desperate mood and shared a picture of what I thought was my completely unrully hair. Even back then some people were sceptical, because my hair can look good sometimes, but the issue was always that it only lasted for a day. After that the curls disappeared and I had to redo everything every single morning, which was exhausting.\n\nFor context, I straightened my hair from around age 13 for almost ten years. I have only been properly embracing my natural curls for about a year and a half, so I am definitely still figuring things out.\n\nA few months ago I got the full Bali Curls line as a gift, and since then I have actually stuck to one routine. I now wash my hair with the Bali Curls Nourishing Shampoo and Bali Curls Nourishing Conditioner, brush it while it is wet, then comb through a small amount of Bali Curls Curl Cream. After that I apply a generous but not excessive amount of the Bali Curls Curl Defining Gel. I learned the hard way that too much gel just makes my hair feel heavy and lifeless (even though a lot of peole commented on my last post that theres no such a thing as too much gel, thats just not how it works for me)\n\nI scrunch with a cotton T shirt, plop for a few minutes, then diffuse. I start diffusing without touching my hair and only scrunch later. I never fully dry it because that would take forever. After about half an hour I scrunch in a bit of hair oil (honetsly I just use whatever brand is at my hands) and that is usually when things start looking good. I also use the Bali Curls Heat Protection Spray whenever I diffuse.\n\nOn non wash days I refresh with water from a spray bottle and usually diffuse a little in the morning if I am going out. I do not add extra product. The biggest change is that my hair now actually lasts. It still needs refreshing, but it does not completely fall apart anymore, and it finally looks like curls instead of a daily mystery.\n\nThanks again to everyone who commented on my original post. You were more right than I wanted to admit.",

      "content": "The first 3 pictures are what I wanted, the second to the last is what my hair looks like out of the shower with leave-in conditioner &amp; curl cream (straightens out more once fully dries), and last picture is with full products and diffuser. \n\nI got a perm last week; I asked for big voluminous curls and got barely waves instead. If I let it air dry after brushing it, using a leave in conditioner and curl cream — when it fully dries, it looks almost straight. \n\nIf I want it to look more curly/voluminous, I have to put a TON of product in, diffuse it for a long time and even then it just doesn’t look the way I was expecting. Plus, my hair then feels like I just have so much product in it. \n\nI was hoping for big curls/waves, but ones that actually bounce back if I brush through or something (I don’t want to not brush my hair ever?!). Instead, when I brush my hair it literally looks less curly/wavy than when I’d braid my hair the night before and let it out the next day. Also, there are parts of my hair that are totally straight and when I style it I have to put extra product and extra work into those parts to “force” them to have a wave/curl. \n\nI don’t think this is how a perm should be/look? Am I doing something wrong when styling? What did the hairdresser do wrong here? Is there anything I can do right now (get this corrected with another perm or something?). HELP! ",

      "title": "Trying to grow hair long, but thinking I’m ready to call it quits. Any insight?",
      "content": "Photos 1, 2, 3, 4: From today. A decent hair day, where I styled my hair with kinky curly knot today leave in. aussie instant freeze gel, and diffused it. Not the BEST hair day I’ve had, but good. Also showing it in the bun that I like to wear.\n\nPhoto 5: The other day. Styled my hair, but you can see how dry and wispy it can look.\n\nPhotos 6, 7(😛): Hair without products or styling, air dried. VERY soft and fine and loose waves, but the next day without products, it is nearly straight, and very flat and limp, hence why I need to often style with gel.\n\nPhoto 8: Another day without products… you can see how thin my ends are. I hate how I can see my back THROUGH my hair!!!\n\nPhoto 9: An example styled of how curly my hair can get at this length when styled well, but also the thinness of the ends. \n\nPhotos 10, 11, 12: Hair when it was short with choppy layers. I loved the bounce, fullness and curl. I feel it looks healthiest here, ans maybe I could have done more style wise (updos with small claw clips, etc? at the time to scratch the itch I have to put it up lol)\n\nPhoto 13: Kind of in between. Grown out from the short hair of the previous photos, but still not even touching my shoulders. Love this length also. \n\nHonestly, I’m just very tired of attempting to grow my hair out and I’m about to give up, book a hair appointment, and get it cut back to a short bob. I LOVED my short bob, anywhere between chin length to just above shoulders, my hair is curly, bouncy and full. I’ve been attempting to grow my hair out for a year or so at this point, with 2-3 small trims in 2025. But as its gotten to collar length, it just gets SO wispy. My hair doesn’t curl like it did, and even good hair days are mainly flocked with rough ones. My ends get thin and wispy no matter what, I hate that I can see through them. My hair grows very slow, and I’m starting to wonder if this is even worth it. Sure, I love the look of long wavy hair, but even if I get there, it won’t be thick and lucsious. I’m already getting frustrated with the increased need for product, upkeep, how dry it gets, and the main things tethering me to keep on trying is the idea that I just need to “push through” the wispiness at this length so the fuller hair can catch up, AND that I love that I can put it in a messy updo finally… but again, is it worth it if I end up crying at how thin it looks most days? My hair has looked visually very much similar over the last year despite growth, you can go back and check my post from a bunch of months ago. \n\nI guess I’m just asking, does this even seem worth it for me? I was happier with short hair, but I also yearn for long hair, but frankly, I KNOW its a huge time commitment, energy commitment, etc etc that maybe I just don’t have. I dont even know what I’d do if it did get long - I don’t know how to braid, I know I won’t want to learn elaborate hairstyles or oil anyway. I just feel conflicted bc I keep getting pulled in by yayy messy bun!! Urghh i dont know what to do, I wish my hair wasn’t so fine and wispy and fragile!!😭\n\nMy CURRENT hair routine:\n\n\\- Wash and condition with herbal essence grapefruit shampoo and chamomile conditioner\n\n\\- Glaze and scrunch in kinky curly knot today leave in conditioner in shower\n\n\\- Out of shower, I lightly scrunch out excess water and glaze and scrunch in big quarter sized globs of aussie instant freeze gel\n\n\\- Scrunch hair and plop with microfiber headwrap\n\n\\- Remove wrap after I get dressed, add two more dime sized amounts of gel\n\n\\- Hover Diffuse on high heat high speed till cast forms, then low heat high speed diffuse by cupping my hair into sections\n\n\\- Scrunch out crunch and fluff. My routine has been very similar with random experimentations throughout the years, but it usually always comes back to this. \n\nWhile sleeping, if I don’t plan on showering the next day, I will sleep with my hair in a loose ponytail with a satin scrunchie on top of my head, and then glaze some water over it the next morning for an alright refresh with less defined but still voluminous curls.

When do I give up on this product?? This was literally my last hope after trying EVERYTHING else on the market because everything either my skin burn or breaks me out (I'm allergic to silicones and have fungal acne).\n\nThe rest of my routine is very focused on sensitive skin - simple cleanser morning and night, with sebamed moisturiser and gentle sunscreen AM and CeraVe in the tub PM.

I have to say this product is kinda decent, especially for oily acne-prone skin like me. I heard someone said it might ball up after layering makeup, but I normally just use a hydrating serum, moisturizer and sunscreen, so it works for me. The reason I bought this is because I want to address my redness and hyperpigmentation, and it indeed removed my hyperpigmentation but it really takes time. Lots of TikTok videos show that the hyperpigmentation would just be gone within a week, and I have to say, it’s not that magical. Aside from that, the texture likes a silky gel, which I like.\n",

      "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore anyone jumps in with “confidence is attractive” or “personality matters,” let me stop you right there. Yes, people like me. I make friends easily. I’m respected at work. People enjoy talking to me, hanging out with me, opening up to me. I’m treated well as a human being. But love? Desire? Romantic interest? That’s where the story changes. Being a man is never easy.\n\nBecause I don’t fit the Indian beauty standard for men.\n\nI don’t have that “clean,” “bright,” “presentable” look our society is obsessed with. No matter how well I dress or groom myself, how articulate I am, my skin tone quietly disqualifies me before my personality even gets a chance. It’s always subtle, never openly cruel but it’s there. You can feel it in the hesitation, the polite rejection, the “you are such a nice guy” energy.\n\nDating apps make this even worse. Swipe culture reduces you to a photo, and Indian swipe culture reduces you further to skin tone. You can literally feel that people appreciate you but don’t want you. They will talk, laugh and they will say that you are amazing, then choose someone lighter without a second thought.\n\nWhat hurts the most is that I actually like who I am. I have worked on myself. I’m confident without being arrogant. I’m emotionally aware. I’m stable. I know I’d be a good partner. I don’t hate myself. I just hate that society keeps telling me indirectly, that I’m lovable but not desirable.\n\nAnd no, this isn’t about wanting validation from everyone. I just wish someone would love me for who I am, without subconsciously wishing I looked different. I wish attraction wasn’t so tightly tied to colonial hangovers and fairness ads disguised as “preferences.”\n\nI’m tired of pretending this doesn’t affect me. It does. You can be strong and still feel unwanted. You can be confident and still wish, quietly, that someone chose you without compromise.\n\nI don’t want to be everyone’s favorite friend. I want to be someone’s first choice.\n\nThat’s it. That’s the rant. Thank you for reading. I wish I had someone in my life but it seems like a far fetched dream. I wish someone talks to me or love me at least",

The rest of my face is clear.\n\nI’m not sure what’s suddenly brought this on, but any help or advice would be appreciated.\n\nFew things to note that may or may not be helpful:\n\n\\- I’m not on birth control and haven’t been for around 6 years\n\n\\- I started taking folic acid in October which may be a contributor? (I’m not sure)\n\n\\- I have Hashimoto’s disease and take levothyroxine 75mg every morning\n\n\\- I take Magnesium Glycinate and Probiotics every evening\n\n\\- The only skin care I do is wash my face twice daily. In the morning I wash with warm then cold water and use an SPF 15 moisturise and in the evening I use “Acnecide Purifide Daily Cleanser” I would be open to changing my routine if anyone has found anything that helped them as I wouldn’t know where to start!\n\nThank you all :)",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

The liquid drips off my scalp, gets on my hands, and I'm never sure if I'm getting even coverage. I end up doing this weird gentle massage that probably isn't even helping.  \n  \nCurious if others deal with this:\n\n* Does it drip down your face/neck?\n* Do you feel like you're wasting product?\n* Hard to get it evenly on your scalp?\n* The \"massage\" part feels pointless?\n\nHave you tried any applicator tools? Did they actually help?\n\n**Just trying to figure out if I'm doing something wrong or if this is just how it is lol** ",
