On January my Mother in Law had put a ton of oil in my hair and for the first time since I can think they weren't dry. They were so soft and I loved it. My husband encouraged me to try it again and now I have a good routine for my hair and finally love how it looks and feels. The first 3 pictures are how it looked like in march, when I started the routine. The other pictures are from now.\n\nMy routine is washing once a week with the anti frizz curlshampoo and -conditioner from john frieda, brush with the conditioner in it. \n\nPut in the noname mousse from dm while wet and brush.\n\nPut in selfmade flaxseed gel and brush again.\n\n Scrunch the curls.\n\nScrunch again with a Tshirt.\n\nPlop my hair for 20-30 min.\n\nDiffuse or let it air dry.\n\nScrunch the cast out of my hair with \"Langhaarm√§dchen\" oil.\n\nIf you know something I could make better, please tell me!

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe‚Ñ¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "\nSo, I moved to Noida about four years ago ‚Äî new job, new city, new life‚Ä¶ and suddenly, new problem.\nMy hair started falling like crazy.\nLike actual bunches of hair every wash.\n\nI‚Äôve had acne since my teens, but my parents always brushed it off like, ‚Äúyeh toh normal hai.‚Äù\nOnce I started working, I finally decided ‚Äî okay, no one‚Äôs coming to save me, I‚Äôll figure this out myself.\n\nObviously, I started where everyone starts ‚Äî YouTube and Instagram üò≠.\nTried onion juice, rosemary oil, random ‚Äúhair detox‚Äù tips from influencers.\nEvery reel felt like a new hope, and every shower felt like heartbreak.\n\nThen I realised ‚Äî I‚Äôm actually going to go bald at this rate if I keep experimenting.\nSo began the hunt for a real dermatologist.\nAnd because I‚Äôm a typical social media junkie, I started with the ones who looked the most perfect online.\n\nDermat #1:\nThe ‚Äúprettiest dermatologist‚Äù in South Delhi (you know the one whose husband‚Äôs also a social media star).\nWent to her for 3 months. She‚Äôs from one of those fancy private colleges, looks amazing on Instagram‚Ä¶ but her treatment? Confusing.\nShe‚Äôd say one thing online, prescribe another in person.\nIt felt like she didn‚Äôt even believe in her own advice.\n\nDermat #2:\nNext was a senior male doctor from a big Delhi hospital.\nTotally arrogant. Didn‚Äôt listen, kept interrupting. Also, he was completely bald ‚Äî I‚Äôm sorry, but that did not inspire confidence. üòê\n\nDermat #3:\nThen I tried the husband of one of the biggest dermatologists on Instagram.\nHe was good ‚Äî calm, professional, actually explained things.\nBut their system was impossible. Getting an appointment was like applying for a visa. Truth was , on a weekday noon, which i always prefer, clinic was always empty.\nAnd when I finally got treated, I realised it was the same protocol most good dermats follow.\nNothing unique ‚Äî just great packaging.\n\n\nDermat #4:\nBy now, I had learnt some lessons.\nSo I found a young dermatologist from a government college ‚Äî she‚Äôd built her page around her degrees and her own acne journey. She was based in Hauz khas.\nI liked her vibe, but she was too cautious.\nShe kept saying my hair loss was normal, just fix your lifestyle.\nLike girl, my lifestyle is already squeaky clean ‚Äî I needed help, not another ‚Äúsleep more, drink water‚Äù lecture.\nShe waited months before starting anything real, and by then I was exhausted.\n\nFinally‚Ä¶\nOne of my office colleagues kept insisting I go to this low-profile dermatologist in Noida ‚Äî someone who isn‚Äôt even on social media.\nI went with zero expectations, honestly just out of frustration.\nAnd that‚Äôs when it hit me ‚Äî the really good doctors don‚Äôt have time for reels and filters. They‚Äôre busy doing actual work.\n\nIf you‚Äôve read this far ‚Äî thank you ü´∂\nI just wanted to share this because I know how easy it is to get swayed by social media.\nAnd atleast someone should benefit from my own hard earned money funded research. üòÄ",

Also, i live in the southeast so the moment i spend a day outside, i come home and its practically over. I turn to the mirror and see: BUSH. Well, at least its a pink bush now. \n\nCurrent routine: wash every 3-5 days. Sometimes 1 week because i procrastinate. Two types of shampoo and i only do my scalp + conditioner on the ends which i let rest for at least 5 min. Rinse out. been trying to use lukewarm water at the least. Then if i feel like it, i use the curl talk gel + mousse and maybe a lil oil on my ends. Nothing crazy. I sleep in a ponytail. Thats probably not a great idea but i cant get used to bonnets and there seem to be so many sleep methods/products/bla bla out there that i get overhwelmed asfuck. Pls help. ",

I wet my hair then add a detangler mixture (water &amp; skala &amp; Pacifica detangler) and pre-poo (African pride). Detangle my hair in sections. Usually I leave that in my hair for a little while. Then I shampoo (Native moisturizing or soapbox coconut oil bar), rinse, and put in hair mask/deep conditoner for like 5-10 minutes depending on which one. I will admit I‚Äôve been over using my hair masks, oops. So now, I will be conditioning my hair instead of masking on most wash days. But other than that tweaking, what else can I do?

I have formulated a routine and been using this for several months. I alternate my skin care routine each day when it comes to the nighttime routine. \n\nIn the mornings, I use:\n\n1. CeraVe Hydrating Cream to Foam facial cleanser \n2. CeraVe Am Facial Lotion 30 SPF\n\nAt night, the first routine is:\n\n1. Neutrogena oil-free pink grapefruit acne face wash with salicylic acid \n2. CeraVe Pm Face Lotion\n3. The Ordinary 10% azelaic acid suspension \n\nThe second night routine is: \n\n1. Botanic Tree Men‚Äôs exfoliating face wash with 2.5% glycolic acid, charcoal, jojoba oil, and aloe vera \n2. Instanatural 7% glycolic acid toner with lactic acid, vitamin c, and witch hazel \n3. CeraVe Pm Face Lotion \n4. The ordinary 10% azelaic acid suspension \n\nI do believe this helps my skin, but the results aren‚Äôt drastic or anything and I still can see the uneven texture of keratosis pilaris bumps. I feel like my routine could be overcomplicated which is making my skin a little irritated and or dryed out because there are times where it gets a little red easily. I am no expert here, it will be really satisfying to find the optimal routine. Any tips/advice is greatly appreciated! \n\n",
