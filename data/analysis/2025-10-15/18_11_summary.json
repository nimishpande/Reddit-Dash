Minimalist Sunscreen SPF 50\n\nThe “everyday reliable coworker” of sunscreens  never misses a deadline but lacks personality.\n\nLightweight and budget-friendly, but that alcohol smell lingers longer than your ex’s texts.\n\nVerdict: Solid performer, no spark.\n\n\n\n3. Fixderma Shadow SPF 50\n\nMore like Thickderma. Great protection, but the texture could double as cake batter.\n\nIf you’re oily-skinned, this will have you looking like you moisturized with candle wax.\n\nVerdict: Best for dry skin winters only.\n\n\n\n4. Re’equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch\n\nMatte? Yes. Dry touch? Sure. Comfortable? That’s a no.\n\nIt’s like applying successively smaller layers of chalk.\n\nBut hey, it’s one of the few that actually controls sweat.\n\nVerdict: Good for Athletes. Functional, not romantic.\n\n\n\n5. Dot &amp; Key Watermelon Cooling Sunscreen\n\nSmells great, feels cute, and then proceeds to melt faster than your patience in Delhi summer.\n\nGood for “I’m-just-running-to-the-café” days, not for actual sun exposure.\n\nVerdict: Influencer energy, not athlete energy.",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I wash my face like 4 to 5 times a week, first oil cleanse and after that i use a 100% natural light face foam to clean. I also use like 1 or 2 times a week either retinol, some kind of salicylic acid/blemish control/AHA BHA or bakuchiol peptide and toner after washing. For moisturising i use a 100% natural vitamin C cream.\n\nI dont know what im doing wrong and ive never found the solution to stop this from happening and taking these blackheads away.\n\nI noticed that using oil after washing to moisturise my skin is making it worse, so not doing that anymore. My skin is pretty sensitive so i usually dont try to stress it too much with all kinds of serums.\n\nIf someone could help me, id really appreciate it ❤️🙏 I am a 21 year old woman btw if thats necessary info",

For at least a year, I’ve been completely soaking my hair twice a DAY: once in the morning to style it (product and everything) and once at night while showering.\n\nBecause I want my hair to be healthy, I decided to start a new routine of having a wash day (night technically) followed by two full days of leaving my hair dry. This routine began last night:\n\n- conditioned hair in shower, brushed it out with wet brush under cool water\n- out of shower, applied It’s A 10 Miracle Leave-In Potion, Love Ur Curls Step 3, Love Ur Curls Irish Sea Moss Gel (a good palmful), and scrunched\n- left completely alone to get crunchy, stiff, and completely dry\n- loosely tied up in a pineapple and slept on satin pillowcase\n- woke up next day, lightly misted some parts with spray conditioner/water mix to try and get rid of frizzy strands (a forlorn effort, they’re still there in my picture)\n\nI’m honestly pretty happy with it, though mostly because I didn’t have to style it this morning and wait three hours for it to dry. I don’t expect it to be beautiful by the end of the day though, let alone tomorrow without a full refresh (I might trim my routine down to 48 hours between washes unless someone tells me otherwise).\n\nDoes anyone have any feedback on my day one post-sleep hair or recommendations on ways to get rid of the little frizzy/straight strands lingering?\n\n",

She looks nice with her natural hair, however, to both our surprise her hair is kinda wavy, not straight as it was while it was dyed. My mom says she can’t get it to look look good by drying it straight and doesn’t know how to care for the new (to her) type of hair she has. I don’t know how to help her either since I’ve inherited my dad’s pin straight hair, but would like to help somehow still ( and also spend some time with her since I rarely get to go home). \nSo i come to you for help.

Then tried what my skin used to like a long time ago with Ole Henrisken only to discover that Sephora doesn't carry it anymore so i tried something else and it immediately bothered my skin so i returned it right away (i don't even have sensitive skin) and now trying the Innisfree green tea set that the lady there suggested for me. \n\nI do like it a lot better. I like the gentleness of it. My skin healed shockingly fast and looks very even toned and bright right now which is what i want, but my skin is STILL SO DRY. My forehead especially. It becomes flaky and really tight only a couple hours into my work day, and when i go home for lunch, i have to put more on. My forehead has begun to lightly sting when i use certain things which i won't be doing again until this dryness is solved.\n\nThis morning, i even tried to put on my night rosehip oil and BOTH of my serums hoping it would help and STILL. Before my lunch even arrives, i HAVE to use my hand lotion to ease the discomfort of tightness because i just cannot stand the feeling of dry skin. My hand lotion is amazing for my hands but still doesn't help when im desperate. \n\nI live in Canada and winter is on its way where it gets quite dry but i was already having issues with the dry skin in the summer. I don't remember always having dry skin, this feels like a fairly new change (aside from the fact that winter is usually a bit more dry, otherwise, i've always had pretty \"normal\" skin).\n\nI've also tried for some time now to push my face moisturizer into my hair line because it feels like the dryness of my forehead carries into my hairline but i don't want to make my hair greasy either... maybe thats another post for the haircare sub.\n\nAnyway, i like a dewy, glowy, even toned skin, and clearly need much better moisture. Does anyone have any suggestions on ANYTHING to achieve all of these desires/needs? I will admit... I'm big on pretty packaging and i'm sure that's whats holding me back from actually finding something that my skin loves and i might just have to suck it up lolol.",

      "content": "You’ve probably heard of Wegovy and Mounjaro, the diet drugs that have recently become hot topics. In the past, a drug called Ozempic was introduced as a diabetes treatment, but as rumors spread that it caused weight loss, the number of people using it for dieting purposes skyrocketed.\n\n  \nThe problem, however, is that as people lose weight, their faces start to look strange. This phenomenon has even earned the nickname “Ozempic Face.”\n\n  \n“Ozempic Face” refers to a phenomenon where, as facial fat rapidly decreases—like air deflating from a balloon—the cheeks become hollow, wrinkles deepen, and the lips thin out. Some people experience such drastic changes that they look more than 10 years older.\n\n\n\nThe problem is that it’s not just fat that decreases — components that maintain skin elasticity, such as collagen and elastin, also weaken. Collagen becomes thinner and more fragile, and elastin gets damaged. It’s similar to the framework of a building corroding over time.\n\n  \nOn top of that, diet drugs suppress your appetite, making you eat less. As a result, your skin doesn’t get enough essential nutrients, causing it to lose vitality and become rough and dull.\n\n  \nYou might think, “Won’t my face go back to normal once I stop taking the drug?”  \nHowever, while your body weight may increase after quitting, the fat in your face doesn’t return to its original state.  \nAs a result, people often resort to treatments like fillers, fat grafting, skin tightening, or even cosmetic surgery to fix the so-called “Ozempic Face.”  \nIn most cases, it takes a combination of these procedures to restore facial volume and elasticity.\n\n  \nWeight loss drugs can be effective for reducing body weight, but the side effects are too serious to use them just for losing a few pounds, right?\n\n  \nIf necessary, medication can help, but a healthy diet and regular exercise are the safest and most reliable ways to lose weight while keeping your skin healthy.\n\n  \nToday’s post was written based on a paper published last week, and I tried to make it easy to understand. I hope it was helpful.\n\nI’ll bring another interesting topic next time.\n\nThank you",

Recently like just a week before I started using the Minimalist Sunscreen.. within like 3 days of using it my face started showing these bumps. I thought it was my luteal phase so pimples are obvious but these don't seem like pimples now(except one on the cheek). Please help i need your advice. I've obviously thought to discontinue using it. Previously I used fixderma gel susncreen and that suited me well still pta nhi kya masti chari thi i thought lets go for a change but big mistake. I have combination to oily skin and am only 19 with a basic CMS plus adapalene routine. Adapalene has suited my skin well so am sure nothing else rather than the sunscreen is causing this. Ab mummy daat rhi h \"or lagao ut Patang chize mu par\" \"Acha khasa mu bigar diya\"...nd endless stuff like that.😭😭😭 ",

      "content": "I used to struggle with hormonal acne until it completely cleared up. I started noticing closed comodones on my cheeks where my acne used to be. So I started using Peter thomas Roth water drench moisturizer and Paula’s choice toner. My acne IMMEDIATELY came back and went from the first picture to the second. It’s now been 4 months since the first photo and I still can’t get my skin to settle down. I wash my face with innisfree green tea face wash 2x per day, ordinary hylauronic acid serum at night and neutrogena hydro moisturizer. My biggest issue is picking, I have ADHD so it’s been really difficult. But even when I stop picking, I notice more pimples coming up on my cheeks right beside where the old pimples were. How do I get the white bumps (almost the stage right before they turn red, not white heads) gone before they start to rise? Any tips on how to heal my skin and get it back to where it was. First pic is me before PTR moisturizer and Paula’s choice toner, second photo is after. Third photo is the worst my skin got using the above mentioned products (plus others for damage control that did not work), 4th pic is what my skin used to look like before the closed comedones (and weight training 5 days a week). 5th pic is my skin today, first day off my period. Please help. I’m feeling helpless, and although this isn’t the worst my skin has ever been, I’ve had clear skin and I know I can get it again. Anyone with similar acne please comment products that worked for you. ",
