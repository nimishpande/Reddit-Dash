The other pictures are from now.\n\nMy routine is washing once a week with the anti frizz curlshampoo and -conditioner from john frieda, brush with the conditioner in it. \n\nPut in the noname mousse from dm while wet and brush.\n\nPut in selfmade flaxseed gel and brush again.\n\n Scrunch the curls.\n\nScrunch again with a Tshirt.\n\nPlop my hair for 20-30 min.\n\nDiffuse or let it air dry.\n\nScrunch the cast out of my hair with \"Langhaarm√§dchen\" oil.\n\nIf you know something I could make better, please tell me!

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe‚Ñ¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

They charge me extra because the hairdresser who did my hair was actually a manager (I was unaware of this.) I was annoyed but I paid and politely thanked them.\n\nI made another appointment with them this week for a cut and wash. I studied their price list and noticed the changes in price according to the rank of hairdresser. So I specifically requested a stylist (most reasonably priced). They mumbled about \"oh your usual will do it for you. I see here you had hair done by (manager).\" I explained that I wanted a stylist and that it was more affordable for me, they kept telling me she's unavailable. I said OK I will come in when she is there. They said she is on holiday and don't know when she's back. We ended the phone call there. I feel pretty deflated. I guess I'm not bothering with them again, so I will find somewhere out of town but WHY does this happen? Any tips on how I can speak to hairdressers next time to avoid this? I think I was polite.

      "content": "\nSo, I moved to Noida about four years ago ‚Äî new job, new city, new life‚Ä¶ and suddenly, new problem.\nMy hair started falling like crazy.\nLike actual bunches of hair every wash.\n\nI‚Äôve had acne since my teens, but my parents always brushed it off like, ‚Äúyeh toh normal hai.‚Äù\nOnce I started working, I finally decided ‚Äî okay, no one‚Äôs coming to save me, I‚Äôll figure this out myself.\n\nObviously, I started where everyone starts ‚Äî YouTube and Instagram üò≠.\nTried onion juice, rosemary oil, random ‚Äúhair detox‚Äù tips from influencers.\nEvery reel felt like a new hope, and every shower felt like heartbreak.\n\nThen I realised ‚Äî I‚Äôm actually going to go bald at this rate if I keep experimenting.\nSo began the hunt for a real dermatologist.\nAnd because I‚Äôm a typical social media junkie, I started with the ones who looked the most perfect online.\n\nDermat #1:\nThe ‚Äúprettiest dermatologist‚Äù in South Delhi (you know the one whose husband‚Äôs also a social media star).\nWent to her for 3 months. She‚Äôs from one of those fancy private colleges, looks amazing on Instagram‚Ä¶ but her treatment? Confusing.\nShe‚Äôd say one thing online, prescribe another in person.\nIt felt like she didn‚Äôt even believe in her own advice.\n\nDermat #2:\nNext was a senior male doctor from a big Delhi hospital.\nTotally arrogant. Didn‚Äôt listen, kept interrupting. Also, he was completely bald ‚Äî I‚Äôm sorry, but that did not inspire confidence. üòê\n\nDermat #3:\nThen I tried the husband of one of the biggest dermatologists on Instagram.\nHe was good ‚Äî calm, professional, actually explained things.\nBut their system was impossible. Getting an appointment was like applying for a visa. Truth was , on a weekday noon, which i always prefer, clinic was always empty.\nAnd when I finally got treated, I realised it was the same protocol most good dermats follow.\nNothing unique ‚Äî just great packaging.\n\n\nDermat #4:\nBy now, I had learnt some lessons.\nSo I found a young dermatologist from a government college ‚Äî she‚Äôd built her page around her degrees and her own acne journey. She was based in Hauz khas.\nI liked her vibe, but she was too cautious.\nShe kept saying my hair loss was normal, just fix your lifestyle.\nLike girl, my lifestyle is already squeaky clean ‚Äî I needed help, not another ‚Äúsleep more, drink water‚Äù lecture.\nShe waited months before starting anything real, and by then I was exhausted.\n\nFinally‚Ä¶\nOne of my office colleagues kept insisting I go to this low-profile dermatologist in Noida ‚Äî someone who isn‚Äôt even on social media.\nI went with zero expectations, honestly just out of frustration.\nAnd that‚Äôs when it hit me ‚Äî the really good doctors don‚Äôt have time for reels and filters. They‚Äôre busy doing actual work.\n\nIf you‚Äôve read this far ‚Äî thank you ü´∂\nI just wanted to share this because I know how easy it is to get swayed by social media.\nAnd atleast someone should benefit from my own hard earned money funded research. üòÄ",

      "content": "Hey guys \n\n\nI think I damaged my skin barrier w over exfoliation. It happened to me a few times already over the past 2yrs &amp; I‚Äôve never really seen the end of it. \n\nI have no  ‚Äú irritation/redness/ or sensitivity. My symptoms are : surge of breakouts everywhere skin oilier than usual , waxy appearance of forehead + deepening of fine lines \n\nThe 1st time it happened it took forever for me to get ahold of it bc I didn‚Äôt know how to go about it. I suspected fungal acne so I had tried nizoral among other things. \n\nI finally did a 8w break no exfo no actives. It‚Äôs hard to remember exactly how it went &amp; the progress bc I didn‚Äôt keep log of my healing journey so details are blurry. I think I cleansed 2x a day bc I still have very oily combo skin &amp; prone to breakouts . I believe I had tried to ditch the AM cleanse before &amp; while it had helped maybe for the 1st week, things were getting very congested after that. \n\n\n\nSo anyways in short I did 2x day gentle cleanse followed by my hydro boost water gel + spf. Obv no SPF in PM\n\n. After 8 weeks I reintroduced actives slowly &amp; cleared all my acne, skin looked great but I messed it up again 2mths later like an idiot w exfo. I think my skin barrier was still fragile &amp; it wasn‚Äôt resilient at all. \n\nStarted breaking about maybe 3-5 days later &amp; it got exponentially worse.\n\nI figured let‚Äôs start over again &amp; reset everything \nI took another 8w break this time I didn‚Äôt cleanse in the AM &amp; idk why I did that bc my skin got super congested. \n\nI reintroduced actives again over 1 mth period but somehow I messed up again this time with physical exfo which is a big no no on active pimples (idk why I did that I‚Äôm mad at myself)\n\n\nNow 3rd break. I‚Äôm trying to stay hopeful bc I did successfully heal my acne the 1st time so I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs possible again. \n\nBut my skin is soooooo freaking oily &amp; congested. And I feel the more oil sits on my skin the more congestion &amp; the more inflamed&amp; irritated my pores get \n\nMy question is what should I expect as I quit all actives to heal my barrier while dealing with acne prone skin that is very oily?\n\nDid anyone ever heal their barrier w oily acne prone skin? It‚Äôs so hard to stay away from actives even though it‚Äôs what I should do. it feels the more I neglect my acne the worse it gets &amp; I heard that if you don‚Äôt treat your acne, it gets worse &amp; harder to treat in the future. I‚Äôm scared things will get out of control. \n\nSo far on this active break I‚Äôve completed 3w no exfo &amp; a little over 2w no actives ( benzoyl peroxide) \n\nSkin is gross oily congested pimples multiplying faster than they heal. It‚Äôs hell. I don‚Äôt really remember how my first break went so I need to hear from others. Idk what‚Äôs normal at this point. I hear people healing their skin barrier &amp; irritation subsides after 1-2 weeks but I never had irritation just a bunch of breakouts !  I‚Äôm acne prone so w/o treatment it gets ugly regardless of the barrier . \n\n\n\nI‚Äôm hoping by week 4-5 things will calm down since it‚Äôs a full skin cycle or so?\n\nPlease tell me your stories of skin barrier repair with oily acne prone skin . How did it go. Did it get worse before it got better or only worse bc you didn‚Äôt use acne treatment ??\n\n\n\n\n",

I finished my course in March and although my skin isn‚Äôt completely acne free, it is a lot better than before. Since stopping accutane however I have been hesitant to add anything to my routine as I don‚Äôt want to end up back where I started. I‚Äôm writing in hopes that the people on this thread might be able to give me some product recommendations that might help me work towards my skin goals!\n\nMy current routine:\n(AM and PM)\n- La Roche-Posay gentle foaming cleansing oil (dry to extra dry skin)\n- La Roche-Posay triple repair moisturizing cream (extra dry skin)\n\nI have always struggled with trying to ID my skin type but I believe I lean more towards the dry side. I‚Äôm specifically looking for products that will help with the congestion of my pores (maybe an exfoliate?) and my skin texture/scars from the accutane. Any advice is greatly appreciated!!\n",

Also, i live in the southeast so the moment i spend a day outside, i come home and its practically over. I turn to the mirror and see: BUSH. Well, at least its a pink bush now. \n\nCurrent routine: wash every 3-5 days. Sometimes 1 week because i procrastinate. Two types of shampoo and i only do my scalp + conditioner on the ends which i let rest for at least 5 min. Rinse out. been trying to use lukewarm water at the least. Then if i feel like it, i use the curl talk gel + mousse and maybe a lil oil on my ends. Nothing crazy. I sleep in a ponytail. Thats probably not a great idea but i cant get used to bonnets and there seem to be so many sleep methods/products/bla bla out there that i get overhwelmed asfuck. Pls help. ",

Essentially the title is as it suggests, my hair feels dry even after washing it. It gets frizzy even when wet. When its dried off, moving my ruins any curl and it instantly turns frizzy. If I move it up, it gets ruined and doesn't go back down. Now, I assume the issue is my conditioner. After trying an array of conditioners I was recommended to try a deep conditioner. So I tried Alikay Naturals Honey and Sage Deep Conditioner and it was awful. I even tried it with a heat cap and the result was the same. I assume its due to the protein in it but I'm honestly not sure. I was recommended a moisturizing conditioner but I'm not sure about anything at this point. Do I try that, is it a deep conditioner that I need or perhaps something else.

The first picture is my hair now on a wash day, second pic was about half a year ago when I was fed up with my hair and did the bare minimum. Mostly because I was never taught how to care for my curly hair. Before I was just using leave in (usually way too thick and heavy for my curls) and a curl cream, without sectioning.\n\nNow I‚Äôve learned I was probably over moisturizing my hair with no protein. After spending way too much money on products lol, sectioning, and not being afraid to add more product that I though I needed, my hair is looking better than ever and way curlier than it‚Äôs ever been! \n\n Third pic is all the styling products I currently have in rotation. My question is, do you all find you have to rotate a lot of different products so your curls don‚Äôt get ‚Äúused to it‚Äù and have too much of the same ingredients built up? I know about deep cleansing to remove buildup, but I‚Äôm wondering if switching products a lot keeps your curls looking nicer? Because in my experience once I find products that ‚Äúwork‚Äù once I stick with them long enough I feel like they stop making my hair look as good. Just wondering if anyone has found this? Hopefully this all makes sense!\n\nMy current routine and order: (I usually wash my hair 2-3 times a week) \n\n-Shampoo either the AG Care Moisture line or Ouidad water works clarifying shampoo (once every 1-2 weeks) \n-Protein mask after shampooing with the Cecred Protein mask (once every 3-4 weeks)\n-Condition either the AG Care Moisture line or AG Mushroom deep moisture mask (once every 1-2 weeks)\n-once out of shower, Eva nyc 10-in-1 primer \n-leave in conditioner ouidad moisture lock\n-jojoba oil\n-section and wet hair, apply cream/gel either the ouidad vital curl cream-gel (what I used in the pic) or the AG Care recoil\n-finish with mousse either the ouidad vital curl soft defining mousse (what I used in the pic) or the AG Care extra firm mousse. \n-diffuse then scrunch out cast with the BB Hairdresser oil. \n-refresh days I like to use the Design Essentials mousse since it‚Äôs a very light hold and then I diffuse and add oil if needed. \n \nAlso I mix and match the creams and mousses sometimes, but I usually like to stick with the same brands together as I feel like they work the best. \n\nAny product recommendations are welcome, please and thank you! üôÇ\n",

She washes morning and night using Cerave foaming face wash or Cerave with SA and does mud masks and sulfur treatments. We were using Benzoyl Peroxide spot treatment but it didn't seem to help and was bleaching her sheets, so we stopped. She also uses pimple patches and that also doesn't seem to help. She uses moisturizer as needed, usually just Vanicream Moisturizing Cream. I'm hesitant to use anything too harsh since I don't want long term damage on her young skin. I really want to help her because she's started picking at them and I'm afraid it will scar. Anyone have recommendations for something affordable to get rid of the forehead bumps?",
