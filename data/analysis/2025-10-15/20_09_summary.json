      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

For at least a year, I’ve been completely soaking my hair twice a DAY: once in the morning to style it (product and everything) and once at night while showering.\n\nBecause I want my hair to be healthy, I decided to start a new routine of having a wash day (night technically) followed by two full days of leaving my hair dry. This routine began last night:\n\n- conditioned hair in shower, brushed it out with wet brush under cool water\n- out of shower, applied It’s A 10 Miracle Leave-In Potion, Love Ur Curls Step 3, Love Ur Curls Irish Sea Moss Gel (a good palmful), and scrunched\n- left completely alone to get crunchy, stiff, and completely dry\n- loosely tied up in a pineapple and slept on satin pillowcase\n- woke up next day, lightly misted some parts with spray conditioner/water mix to try and get rid of frizzy strands (a forlorn effort, they’re still there in my picture)\n\nI’m honestly pretty happy with it, though mostly because I didn’t have to style it this morning and wait three hours for it to dry. I don’t expect it to be beautiful by the end of the day though, let alone tomorrow without a full refresh (I might trim my routine down to 48 hours between washes unless someone tells me otherwise).\n\nDoes anyone have any feedback on my day one post-sleep hair or recommendations on ways to get rid of the little frizzy/straight strands lingering?\n\n",

Then I used a spray heat protectant and difused. \n\nLooked good on Monday. Looked okay on Tuesday morning. By the afternoon it was over. I tried to \"refresh\" last night. I used mousse, but that didn't really do much to help. I had it up in a puff today (Wednesday). \n\nDid anyone have a lot of problems keeping curls, then discovered something that worked for them? I don't even need a week. If I could have made it so that I washed again on Thursday evening, I would have been happy! My goal is to wash and redo twice a week. \n\n air. Medium to fine. I don't know my porosity, but I assume it's normal. Color treated (cause I'm gray). \n\nAny advice would be appreciated. \n\n\\------------\n\nRoutine -\n\nKind of a product junkie. Right now I switch off between Cecred Shampoo and Not Your Mother's (new version of Tahitian). Same for conditioner. \n\nUse weightless air dry cream from curlsmith and curl smith's curl retainer gel. Refreshed a bit Monday night with Curlsmith moisture memory or whatever it's called. \n\nI tried putting in a pattern mousse on Tuesday evening, but hair was still frizzy the next morning, so that was a waste of time. My hair doesn't really like Pattern, but I keep trying because I love the way the Palo Santo version smells. ",

      "content": "You’ve probably heard of Wegovy and Mounjaro, the diet drugs that have recently become hot topics. In the past, a drug called Ozempic was introduced as a diabetes treatment, but as rumors spread that it caused weight loss, the number of people using it for dieting purposes skyrocketed.\n\n  \nThe problem, however, is that as people lose weight, their faces start to look strange. This phenomenon has even earned the nickname “Ozempic Face.”\n\n  \n“Ozempic Face” refers to a phenomenon where, as facial fat rapidly decreases—like air deflating from a balloon—the cheeks become hollow, wrinkles deepen, and the lips thin out. Some people experience such drastic changes that they look more than 10 years older.\n\n\n\nThe problem is that it’s not just fat that decreases — components that maintain skin elasticity, such as collagen and elastin, also weaken. Collagen becomes thinner and more fragile, and elastin gets damaged. It’s similar to the framework of a building corroding over time.\n\n  \nOn top of that, diet drugs suppress your appetite, making you eat less. As a result, your skin doesn’t get enough essential nutrients, causing it to lose vitality and become rough and dull.\n\n  \nYou might think, “Won’t my face go back to normal once I stop taking the drug?”  \nHowever, while your body weight may increase after quitting, the fat in your face doesn’t return to its original state.  \nAs a result, people often resort to treatments like fillers, fat grafting, skin tightening, or even cosmetic surgery to fix the so-called “Ozempic Face.”  \nIn most cases, it takes a combination of these procedures to restore facial volume and elasticity.\n\n  \nWeight loss drugs can be effective for reducing body weight, but the side effects are too serious to use them just for losing a few pounds, right?\n\n  \nIf necessary, medication can help, but a healthy diet and regular exercise are the safest and most reliable ways to lose weight while keeping your skin healthy.\n\n  \nToday’s post was written based on a paper published last week, and I tried to make it easy to understand. I hope it was helpful.\n\nI’ll bring another interesting topic next time.\n\nThank you",

Recently like just a week before I started using the Minimalist Sunscreen.. within like 3 days of using it my face started showing these bumps. I thought it was my luteal phase so pimples are obvious but these don't seem like pimples now(except one on the cheek). Please help i need your advice. I've obviously thought to discontinue using it. Previously I used fixderma gel susncreen and that suited me well still pta nhi kya masti chari thi i thought lets go for a change but big mistake. I have combination to oily skin and am only 19 with a basic CMS plus adapalene routine. Adapalene has suited my skin well so am sure nothing else rather than the sunscreen is causing this. Ab mummy daat rhi h \"or lagao ut Patang chize mu par\" \"Acha khasa mu bigar diya\"...nd endless stuff like that.😭😭😭 ",
