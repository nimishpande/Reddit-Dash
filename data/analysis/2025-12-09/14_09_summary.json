      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi! \n\nI would like to start oiling my hair and I need some advice on the following: should I even do it? What's the best oil for my hair and expectations? How to oil it? (Skip paragraphs about my hair and hair care, if you don't need that information to give me advice)\n\nSo a little bit about my hair - I have straight,  fairly thin hair, natural colour. When I was a baby I had black curly hair, but with time, it has lightened to dark blonde/light brown colour and it has straightened completely. It cannot hold a curl for the life of me. My hair is around my waist length now, and it has been growing fast. It's been getting thicker too (not sure if it's bc of supplements or new shampoo conditioner). But the only issue I have - it's frizzy and although it feels soft, it can sometimes look a little bit like hay. There is not much shine to it. Also, my scalp I would say, is on the oily side.\n\nSo first question, if I want to increase the shine, maybe strengthen my hair, would oiling help? And would it be okay to do even with my scalp being quite oily already?\n\nNow when it comes to hair care, or my hair routine, this is the usual - I shampoo it and I use a silicone scalp massager to get the shampoo to reach every root, and to clean all of my scalp. I rinse and then squeeze out as much water from my hair as I can. I then lather in the conditioner, focusing mainly on the ends and avoiding the scalp. I put my hair up for a bit (1-2 minutes), while conditioner is sitting in my hair. Then I rinse the conditioner out. After I come out of the shower, I towel dry my hair and I add a hair serum, starting from the ends up. Once a month, I use a scalp scrub, to really clear out the pores. And maybe once every two months, I do an ampoule of hair \"filler\" treatment (l'ador hair fill up, korean). And I do, unfortunately, end up air drying my hair. I know I need to stop that xD.\n\nNow with all of that information, do you have any recommendations of what hair oil should I use for my hair? I want it to become shinier and less frizzy, but I also don't want to have my hair start thinning again, so what could I use?\n\nAnd most importantly, how should I use it? During my research, I got very confused, because everyone seems to do it differently, so I guess it depends on hair type. That's why I'm providing as much information that could help.\n\nThank you for advice! And sorry for such a long post 🙈\n\n",

On a little shopping spree high, I walked into Ulta for the first time and I was instantly greeted by the manager and she was extremely helpful but she was a really fast talker and well.. I got lost and was too embarrassed to ask her to repeat herself (I know, I’m working on the spine part😂) Well, long story longer, I bought these products (everything she recommended lol) but i am not sure when i should use them (in the morning? at night? both?) especially with me working 6pm- 4:40am..

It’s really starting to get to me mentally.\n\nBasic info:\n• Age/sex: 26, male\n• Location: UK\n• Back acne for: ~2 years\n\nTreatments (past + current):\n• Lots of oral antibiotics as a teenager\n• Currently on oral antibiotics again from my GP for the back acne\n• Adapalene gel at the moment\n• Previously used tretinoin (helped a bit but didn’t clear it)\n• Was on isotretinoin (Accutane) about 10 years ago for facial acne – I didn’t have back acne back then. My derm is now suggesting Accutane again.\n\nLifestyle / hygiene:\n• Eat fairly clean, exercise regularly\n• Shower straight after workouts\n• Change into clean clothes after sweating\n• Wash bed sheets 1–2x per week\n• Use a gentle cleanser on my back (no scrubs)\n• Not using moisturiser on my back at the moment – some moisturisers seemed to break me out\n• Sometimes my back feels itchy after washing, so I’m worried I might be irritating my skin barrier\n\nExtra context:\n• I sweat a lot – even when I’m sitting still and not hot, my armpits/back/chest get sweaty\n• My recent blood tests showed higher oestradiol (E2)\n• I take finasteride for hair loss (DHT blocker)\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n• Has anyone had similar back acne + sweating + hormones/finasteride, and what actually helped you long-term?\n• For those who went on Accutane for body/back acne, did it help the back specifically?\n• Any body washes/moisturisers you’ve found that don’t make things worse, especially if your skin is easily irritated/itchy?\n• For the scars and dark marks, did anything help on the back or was it mainly time + stopping new breakouts?\n\nI’ll attach pictures of my back in different lighting.\n\nI know nobody can diagnose me here – I’m just trying to get real experiences and see what’s worth discussing further with my derm.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Also, where I live, people act like it’s weird if someone uses sunscreen in public, so reapplying at school isn’t really an option.\n\nI usually apply around 2 fingers of sunscreen on my face and 1 finger on my neck in the morning.\n\nMy question is:  \nDo I actually need to reapply sunscreen before the 3 PM ride, or is the morning application enough since I’m indoors the whole day?\n\nAlso, if it helps:\n\n* It’s a mixture of chemical + physical filters.\n* I’m not sweating much during school.\n* I’m not rubbing my face a lot.\n\nWould love to know what others in similar situations do, and whether reapplication is necessary or not.",

I came in with options and showed her, and she said we could experiment and she’s like to me, “I don’t feel comfortable with many people experimenting like this but we’ve done so many colours!” so i feel bad but my hair is WAY too dark, and on top of that, another hairdresser there started cutting my hair, sometimes im booked with multiple people in a visit so i didn’t think anything of it. she just did the bottom layer at the back before my hairdresser came over and was like “oh no she’s booked with me, she has a v cut” I have a v at the back and a literal wolf cut and she fully cut it straight and took so much length off. My hairdresser i think tried to fix it but my ends are like blunt and lowkey the hair cut looks so shit too. She didn’t even mention it either, It’s just that after spending 3 days hating my hair i’ve put 2 and 2 together. \n\nI tried washing it, thinking the colour maybe just too saturated because it’s fresh but it didn’t fade at all and the cut looks even worse in my natural wavy/curly hair. I’m shattered and she charged me $300. \n\nI’m really non confrontational but I HATE my hair so much like it makes me want to cry every time i look at it. ",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
