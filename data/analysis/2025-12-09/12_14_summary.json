      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi! \n\nI would like to start oiling my hair and I need some advice on the following: should I even do it? What's the best oil for my hair and expectations? How to oil it? (Skip paragraphs about my hair and hair care, if you don't need that information to give me advice)\n\nSo a little bit about my hair - I have straight,  fairly thin hair, natural colour. When I was a baby I had black curly hair, but with time, it has lightened to dark blonde/light brown colour and it has straightened completely. It cannot hold a curl for the life of me. My hair is around my waist length now, and it has been growing fast. It's been getting thicker too (not sure if it's bc of supplements or new shampoo conditioner). But the only issue I have - it's frizzy and although it feels soft, it can sometimes look a little bit like hay. There is not much shine to it. Also, my scalp I would say, is on the oily side.\n\nSo first question, if I want to increase the shine, maybe strengthen my hair, would oiling help? And would it be okay to do even with my scalp being quite oily already?\n\nNow when it comes to hair care, or my hair routine, this is the usual - I shampoo it and I use a silicone scalp massager to get the shampoo to reach every root, and to clean all of my scalp. I rinse and then squeeze out as much water from my hair as I can. I then lather in the conditioner, focusing mainly on the ends and avoiding the scalp. I put my hair up for a bit (1-2 minutes), while conditioner is sitting in my hair. Then I rinse the conditioner out. After I come out of the shower, I towel dry my hair and I add a hair serum, starting from the ends up. Once a month, I use a scalp scrub, to really clear out the pores. And maybe once every two months, I do an ampoule of hair \"filler\" treatment (l'ador hair fill up, korean). And I do, unfortunately, end up air drying my hair. I know I need to stop that xD.\n\nNow with all of that information, do you have any recommendations of what hair oil should I use for my hair? I want it to become shinier and less frizzy, but I also don't want to have my hair start thinning again, so what could I use?\n\nAnd most importantly, how should I use it? During my research, I got very confused, because everyone seems to do it differently, so I guess it depends on hair type. That's why I'm providing as much information that could help.\n\nThank you for advice! And sorry for such a long post 🙈\n\n",

      "content": "I’ve been noticing a lot of consumerism, marketing gimmicks, and wrong skincare trends especially things like topical glutathione, 7-step routines, and overly hyped beauty serums. So here’s some simple, dermatologist-backed guidance based on personal experience and expert advice:\n\nA basic routine will always beat a complicated one. It saves money, protects your barrier, and gives long-term results.\n\nSunscreen: Use it daily (preferably a pharma-clinical grade sunscreen with a blue-light protection filter) and a lip sunscreen. If you have active, inflamed acne, avoid applying sunscreen directly on top instead use shade, or stay indoors.\n\nCleanser: Use a gentle cleanser. Double cleansing is recommended on days with heavy sunscreen or makeup and its encouraged to do so if you have oily skin. You don’t need morning cleansing cold water is enough unless you’re producing too much oil. keep the Cleansers with actives on your skin for 45 seconds before washing it off.\n\nMoisturiser: Choose one according to your skin type. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramides are helpful.\n\nThat’s all you need. If you have skin concerns, choose one active only. Get a dermatologist assessment and lean towards pharma-grade medicated products, staying consistent with one routine for at least 3 months before changing anything.\n\nRetinoids: Tretinoin is a holy grail as retinoids help with cell turnover and target many major concerns. Glycolic acid , adapalene, and azelaic acid also work well when used correctly (start slow, sandwich method, apply in moderation).\n\nExfoliation: Avoid physical scrubs and herbal DIY remedies. Only use chemical exfoliants like AHA/BHA (salicylic, glycolic, lactic acid, etc.) and use them sparingly.\n\nSheet masks: Expensive and wasteful; the fiber isn’t great for skin or the planet.\n\nToners: Mostly unnecessary. Just dampen your skin with rose water or plain water before applying products to improve absorption. All products like snail mucin, peptides, ceramides, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid should be used on Damp skin while \npotent actives should always be applied on dry skin ideally 10–15 minutes after washing.\nWhen the skin is damp, absorption increases too quickly, which can push strong ingredients deeper than intended and lead to irritation, or burning.\n\nEye creams: Often unnecessary. Under-eye darkness is mostly genetics, sleep, lifestyle, and makeup (some studies show kajal contributes to darkening).\n\nTrends: Don’t blindly follow trends like slugging with Vaseline. It only works if done properly because petroleum jelly is an occlusive  it must be layered over good hydration and only if your skin type suits it.\n\nK-beauty: Korean skincare products aren’t automatically suitable for everyone. Their products are created for Korean climate and skin, and true “glass skin” is usually genetics + aesthetic procedures.\n\nHyperpigmentation in brown skin: Brown skin produces more melanin when healing. So if glycolic acid, shaving, or any method “darkened” your skin, it’s usually because: • your barrier was weak • the product was overused • sunscreen wasn’t applied properly Barrier repair + fewer actives + gentle care is the real solution.\n\nHair removal: Face shaving and laser is usually gentler and better because they don’t pull hair from the root, unlike waxing/threading. (If you have PCOS or hormonal issues, treat the root cause first.)\n\nVitamin C: Not every active is essential. Vitamin C is helpful but potent having the ability to damage your skin instead. improving your diet with these nutrients is often more effective than relying solely on the serum.",

      "content": "Hello Reddit! Recently (the past month) my skin has been breaking out on my cheeks with the odd spot here and there which I had put down to “purging” after using retinol (the kiehl’s daily one in blue bottle), admittedly, over-zealously and the product may have been out of date. About 2.5 months into that, my skin all of a sudden had this major breakout all over my cheeks, chin and forehead and it came as a shock. I am thinking I have severely damaged my skin barrier and it is causing these breakouts, however I am majorly freaking out as I had bad cystic acne when I was 10-15 and had to go on accutane (roaccutane, specifically, as I am in the UK) and my skin has been mostly without an issue since then, just the occasional spot around the time of my period. \n\nI am now in major breakdown mode as a result of this trauma and accutane being the only thing that ever worked for me after trying everything under the sun. On top of that, I have an extended trip to Thailand coming up in early January that has been a very long time coming and it is stressing me out incase my acne hasn’t gone away before then. \n\nHowever after reading a lot I’m also unsure whether it is just acne from a damaged skin barrier or if it also looks like it may be fungal or bacterial?! It’s super difficult to get a dermatologist appointment in the UK without months-long waiting lists and it’s very expensive to go private which I can’t afford to do. \n\nThe spots have been a mix of more cystic as well as itchy white heads that have sometimes appeared in clumps. To top it off, I’m also suffering a little with angular cheilitis which is taking ages to go away which I am trying to keep moisturised with Vaseline. \n\nCurrent routine info to try combat:\nTo try and help my skin currently, I have stopped using the retinol completely and also stopped using the LRP HA B5 serum as I think that may have also been out of date (a sin I am now paying severely for!!) and just using the blue cerave moisturising lotion.  However, I noticed upon extensive scrolling of this subreddit that the cerave moisturising lotion contains HA and niacinamide and this may also be causing my skin to become extremely irritated?! I’ve ordered the viacream cream as well as the lotion as I noticed it was highly recommended here so I thought it may be worth a try to reduce my skin’s angriness and to use instead of the cerave. \n\nI cleanse my face with the garnier micellar water with oil nightly (not in the morning) and I have used the product for a few years without issues previously. \n\nI’ve also recently (maybe last 2 weeks) started to take the Aegles clear skin supplements after seeing them extensively recommended online to try and help with gut issues incase that is causing an issue combined with the damaged skin barrier as I realised my diet has been quite bad and high diary, although previously my diet hadn’t caused me issues. \n\nAlso: I realise there is no spf on here but I’m super hesitant to now try and add one to my routine incase it breaks me out more! (I am sorry skincare gods!😭)",

I discovererd that, the face wash which my dermat prescribed me was stripping my oil, as I have dry skin and I switched to simple face wash. Fortunately it is working for me. Earlier I was using dot &amp; key ceramide moisturiser, which kept breaking out my skin, so I switched to Soonjung barrier repair cream, which is working fabulously. I have been using this for more than a week and I don’t have new comedones coming. Now I have PIH marks and few healing bumps. Can someone one advise me how to fade this stubborn marks.\n",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
