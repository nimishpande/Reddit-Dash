And she prescribed me some gel, creams, acids(BHA if you call that, idk) etc. and that literally helped my skin so much. \n\nPlease visit the dermatologist. Don't experiment with different products if you have acne-prone skin. \n\nI have oily, acne-prone skin. I suffered so much because of experimenting. \n\nYes, there are many scars left still, but i believe on my dermat treatment. It should be clear by next year or so.",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

For context, before I already shaved my head bald since early pandemic due to barber closures and embraced the shaved look (been experiencing diffuse thinning and frontal balding since I was a teenager, I guess). Recently my new GF kiddingly said want to see me with hair, then due to my curious nature, I start to research about AGA and many things. After a few weeks, I decided to start with 1.25mg of oral fin and 5% topical min in late August. September was a bit of a messy routine due to my father going back and forth to the hospital ICU. Also, I'm adding a derma roller and then switching to a stamp once a week. Kinda surprised with the result just now. At first, I thought it was my bias, but when tried to collage two pictures spanning 2 months apart, it was clear there is progress. I just wish I could shown it to my recently deceased father, he jokingly looking forward to have a same hairstyle with me when I succeeded growing hair lol\n\n*My father died on age 75 with head pretty much full of hair haha Bonus pic of him added 💕",

      "content": "I have been on my own curly hair journey since 2020, and it has inspired some of my friends &amp; family members to start their own. My stepmom asked me the other day if I could come over soon to show her how to wear her hair natural/curly, as she is going on a long trip to Costa Rica and doesn’t want to deal with blow drying/straightening. She is very low maintenance/no frills, so I want to keep it as simple as possible. Over the summer she showed me her hair and said “look, I’m rocking curls like you! And I didn’t put anything in it, just air dried”. \n\nIt looks like she has a 3A curl pattern that would of course come out a lot more with products.  She has course, thick, all silver hair. I got her my favorite leave in conditioner (tres luxe untie the knot) and another favorite one-product-routine item I love, the JVN air dry cream. I also plan on getting her a spray bottle for refreshing, and maybe a gel as well. She said her only concern is that she loves to brush her hair but she knows you aren’t really supposed to brush curly hair. I’ll explain to her when you CAN brush it, but I’m not sure which brush to get her? I personally brush my hair before I shower. I’ve tried the curl bounce brush and it honestly isn’t my fav as I still can’t figure out how to properly use it. \n\nTLDR: Does anyone have any recommendations for a brush I can suggest to her for her 3A, course, thick, silver hair? One that can help her with her own curly journey. Any suggestions for a gel would be nice too! I don’t think she would want one with a gel cast; I prefer a cast as my hair holds better that way, but I think she would prefer something lighter. ",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I've been taking biotin supplements to try to get some regrowth. My hair is pretty fine. It used to get tangled and matted really easily but that's not been a problem in a year or two. \n\nRoutine: wash with Maui Moisture light weight shampoo. Conditioner is aussie 3 minute miracle curls. I use different styling products but in these pics I used some curl cream and some deva curl strong hold gel (watered down into a spray). Air dry. I also have Aussie mousse that I sometimes use. I have a silk pillow case and don't usually refresh the hair much. I am also interested in protective hairstyles I could do on day 2/3. I know putting my hair in a bun/pony tail is probably not good for it.\n\nI've had so many different routines in the past and they always seem to stop working eventually. I haven't really found anything that works super well. My hair gets a bit greasy after day 2 too. \n\nI'd love any suggestions you might have. Thanks!",

      "content": "I’ve always had quite problematic skin where I developed keratin plugs under skin, especially on my chin, but it wasn’t too bad.\n\n5 months ago I went through a very stressful situation which led to getting cystic acne almost every single day, which left my face covered in PIE that doesn’t go away. I panicked, I didn’t know what to do so I started Treclin, then read about antiobiotic resitsnace so I stopped, I tried BP 5%, then Azelaic acid (skinoren) for a couple weeks, and lastly Differin starting in September.\n\nI used Differin for a month and used Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume on a wet skin. I woke up one day with irritated face so I decided to take a break and just use Bioderma and that’s it, which didn’t help. I was getting scaly skin snd the cysts were coming, every day. My face was so oily.\n\nThen it got better and I restarted Differin again, used it twice a week for 2 weeks and one day woke up with severely dehydrated tight skin. Differin started to work at minimising the cystic acne, however my skin was extremely dehydrated and oily. I took a one week break where I introduced the Aveeno oat serum and used the LRP toleriane sensitive cream on top. My skin was getting better. I then switched to TO amino acid serum because aveeno was clogging my pores.\n\nAfter a week I decided to use Azelaic acid (Finacea) instead of Differin because I was thinking that because Differin did so well in such a shirt amount of time, the Azelaic acid might be enough, and also help me with the scars that just take ages to clear.\n\nMy skin now has a crawly feeling near nostrils and chin, and I also have bumps on my chin, which I suspect is early PD, it doesn’t itch but I can feel something is wrong. My face is dehydrated again and I’m worried that I won’t be able to treat my acne because I can’t put anything on my skin.\n\nI’m worried to try Accutane because that can flare PD and dry my skin more. I am desperate, I am not sure what I can do!\n\nLeaving my skin alone will just cause the cystic acne to come again…\n\nTL;DR: Developed cystic acne due to stress, tried too many things, ultimately differin and my barrier collapsed. Now I don’t know what to do because I can’t use anything on my face. I probably developed perioral dermatitis because I have small bumps on chin and also sides of bridge of nose, nasolabial folds. Please help!!",

It looks gross, as if I don’t wash my face but I do. It’s not itchy or painful. I’ve tried vanicream face wash, la roche tolerine for oily skin face wash, YTTP kale face wash, and cerave SA cleanser. For moisturizer, I’ve tried Purito oat cream calming gel moisturizer, cookie kind water moisturizer, skin fix water cream, vanicream daily face moisturizer, la roche double repair moisturizer, cetaphil daily moisturizer for all skin types, and no moisturizer at all. Still, nothing helps, and some products have made it worse. My routine is really simple, as it used to be much more extensive, but I feel that my old routine was irritating my skin over all. I’m ashamed to be looked at by even family members. I avoid going out because of it sometimes.",

They mentioned it could help with hair health and potentially thickness.  \n  \nI'm curious if anyone here has tried this route and noticed any actual results? How long did it take to see changes if any? And did you use it alone or in combination with other treatments?  \n  \nI know this isn't the typical min/fin stack that's discussed here, but I'm interested in hearing if anyone has had success with this more natural approach before committing to the usual medications.  \n  \nThanks in advance for any experiences you can share!",

I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

I started my 'curly hair journey' about 2 years ago and my natural texture is high density but fine and it can never make up its mind so each clump varies between 2A (my loosest) and 3-something(my curliest- on a good day). Its kind of like reverse irish curls because i dry brushed my hair as a kid and straightened + bleached it as a teen so the top is curlier than the underneath. My routine for it would consist of umberto giannini mousse all over, eco gel at the ends, and SOMETIMES a cream (same brand as mousse), seperate my hair w/ a curl brush and 'scrunch' my hair with a tshirt/microfibre towel then diffuse.\n\nMy hair will stay intact for the day but overnight it always falls out- ive tried bonnets, pinapple method, buns, plaits, silk scarves, lightweight products, heavy products, different styling methods- nothing has worked more than once!\n\nBecause of this, I would need to refresh my hair everyday or just put it up, however I'm Scottish so it gets wayyy too cold to have to do this in the winter so I've started to just do heatless waves/curls until it gets warmer again in the spring. Im worried this might mess up my pattern all over again!\n\nIm currently washing hair like normal (2-3times a week), applying heat protectant (Chi- 44 Iron Guard) and anti-frizz cream (Umberto Giannini), then blow drying with a revlon brush dryer and putting my hair in a bun overnight- it actually turns out really cute if its a wrap bun! Ive heard even blow dry brushes can damage your pattern, but my hair takes wayyy to long to air dry, and I dont want to loose all the work I put into my hair over the last two years to be gone just because I dont want to freeze to death XD\n\nAny advice?\n\nps. ive added photos of what my hair looked like a few months ago, one was using just scrunch and diffuse, the other was using brush styling (i didnt get the volume right LOL!)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/097uzwj1f76g1.jpg?width=1241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f864a79a15ecb93ef460ecc0d8da1747501c178\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ebn8maj1f76g1.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cd7738f59bbc15a9d536e40c1fa826a3839b9e4",

I'm looking into salt spray.\n\nMy questions:\nMost of these hair transformations are over a few months.  Is there a generalized time period to expect results by?  Should there be an immediate, noticeable difference in the first week or two that gets gradually further from my starting point over a few months, or will it take patience to tell if my hair is wavier/curlier than I've thought for most of my life?\n\nIf finding product that works for any specific individual is a bit of trial and error, and everyone will have different brand preferences for their hair, how do I know if products are 'working' and my hair just isn't that curly, or if I should try a different brand?  Especially when factoring in my above question about how long to see results?  \n\nSo far my hair is just a tiny bit more wavy than it had been, which is slightly disappointing, but it's only been a few days and I am aware that I am very impatient.  I just don't want to be six months in and lying to myself down the line lol",

I say \"supposedly\" because the last two hair cuts one side section has literally stood on end unless it is plastered down with product. (Please see the close up pictures). I spoke to my long-time (20+ years) hairstylist last time and asked whether she had used thinning shears on it, but she said she hadn't. I explained the problem, yet it has happened a second time -- even worse. What is she doing wrong? I can't afford to keep getting bad hair cuts. For context, my hair is somewhat textured and would be naturally curly if I didn't straighten it. I haven't changed shampoo, conditioner, or other routines. It's like she has just forgotten how to cut my hair, or is using some new shears that don't work with mixed race hair.",
