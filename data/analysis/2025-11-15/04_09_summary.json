      "content": "Tried posting this in the wavy hair subreddit as my hair texture varies from a lose curl to a sad wave, but they keep removing my posts/ wouldn’t allow new ones to go through. Im hoping that someone knows how to deal with this.\n\nThis is my natural hair with the waves and everything, just a small amount of product. About 2a-2c on a good day? Why is it that no matter what I do the top of my head refuses to have any texture? I have the same issue with some other parts of my hair and then the mid section is incredibly wavy/curly. No matter what I do my hair ends up like this and im not confident wearing it like this in public — it looks greasy. I already have layers cut into my hair to try to reduce weight and use very minimal product. It gets actually greasy fast so I usually have to wash my hair every day or every other day. I have used so many different products and I get the same results no matter what I do. Am i just screwed to have hair that doesn’t work with me?\n\nMy routine: shampoo with either raw sugar’s moisture smoothie shampoo or the truly unruly shampoo (all over, my hair hates product buildup and I need a clean canvas). Then run either raw sugar’s the grow pro conditioner or the sensitive one conditioner (i get raw/itchy spots on two sections on my scalp) through all of my hair as if i avoid my roots they get greasy faster or my hair is too dry there and i get breakage. Then squish the conditioner out under hot or slightly cold water (depending on how i feel, a chemist was able to prove water temp does not matter in hair that much), and rinse almost all of the conditioner out. Squish being’s major no-free leave in for 2a-2c into my ends to prevent dryness, and squish hairitage’s play it cool heat protectant all over as I usually have to use heat products to make me look presentable. Lastly, squish in miss jessie’s jelly soft curls soft gel to try to get some definition. I usually just let it air dry as diffusing sometimes makes it worse, but my hair is still bad when I let it air dry. If its too wet (as it gives me sensory issues) i might scrunch the ends with a hair towel (i think its microfiber?).",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I shower every day, because if I don’t the oil will build up and make my hair look gross. Freshly dried after a shower, it’s nice and soft and has at least a bit of shape, and looks pretty good!\n\nAfter I head to bed, in the morning it’s relatively passable. Usually I have to fix it a little with some water if I slept weird and it looks funky.\n\nAfter a day at school, it’s completely flat, oily, and I look and feel disgusting. I have NO idea how to stop it. I can’t control it. I’ve made an effort to stop touching it and fixing it during the day because it’s a habit I have and I assumed that might be the problem with how much stuff I’ve touched (it’s a school, it sounded reasonable). I haven’t touched it today at all and it’s yielded the exact same results of looking horrible.\n\nWhat do I do? Am I doing something wrong?? I wash my hair correctly every single day, I THINK I’m taking care of it well, I’m genuinely so lost. At the end of every day I can literally FEEL gross just sitting there. Hell, it’s affecting my self-esteem because I always have to look in the mirror to see the impression I made on other people after my hair has been ruined.

      "content": "So, here's my good side and bad side. Bad side is bad because I sleep on that side.  I have had extreme problems for a few years, one being severe static year 'round even when the dew point is in the 70's in the summer and that's crazy! And it's crazy unmanageable, esp blow-drying and flat-ironing. I think what's going on is my hair is curly and VERY thirsty and damaged from heat tools. At my last trim, about a month ago, my stylist said my hair was STRAIGHT! Um, no it's not.  It's more than wavy, it's loose curls! How could she say that?? Anyway, I didn't use heat tools today, barely any product either, just some Amika The Wizard Hair Detangling Primer where it was needed to comb through it and hey surprise, NO static whatsoever.  My hair is fine, but there's a lot of it. I literally grabbed a two gallon ziploc bag and put all my heat tools in it just now. I'm done,  I'm killing it and none of the professionals out there care. Please help, I need input. And also an idea of how long it will be until it looks healthy again with no more heat tools. Thanks so much!\nRoutine:\n1. Living Proof Hydrate Sheer Shampoo &amp; Conditioner \n2. Slight amount of Amika The Wizard Hair Detangling Primer just where needed to comb through it\n3. Air dried today to show true texture\n4. No bonnet, they fall right off",
