I don’t know if should continue cutting my own hair or if I should continue on the set h for a good curly hair stylist. \n\nAny and all options and advice are appreciated!!! \n\n\nRoutine:\n\nI wash my hair with all about curls shampoo. \n\nI skip conditioner since my hair is so fine and go straight to leave in conditioner. The leave in conditioner I use is the curl smith weightless air dry cream. \n\nWith soaking wet hair I then apply Brad mondo’s wave tech wave foam, which is godsend for anyone that has fine curly hair. It really helps clump my curls together and give them shape and volume without weighing them down.(although the last bottle I got  I noticed a formula change. It’s not as foamy which makes me sad because the foamy was is what helped it apply evenly across my hair)\n\nThe last product I apply is all about curls gel. I stuck it into my hair and then I scrunch my hair with a t-shirt to get out excess moisture and product. \n\nI usually air dry my hair unless I’m going to an event. I’ll defuse for an event just to get more defined curls. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Im hoping that someone knows how to deal with this.\n\nThis is my natural hair with the waves and everything, just a small amount of product. About 2a-2c on a good day? Why is it that no matter what I do the top of my head refuses to have any texture? I have the same issue with some other parts of my hair and then the mid section is incredibly wavy/curly. No matter what I do my hair ends up like this and im not confident wearing it like this in public — it looks greasy. I already have layers cut into my hair to try to reduce weight and use very minimal product. It gets actually greasy fast so I usually have to wash my hair every day or every other day. I have used so many different products and I get the same results no matter what I do. Am i just screwed to have hair that doesn’t work with me?\n\nMy routine: shampoo with either raw sugar’s moisture smoothie shampoo or the truly unruly shampoo (all over, my hair hates product buildup and I need a clean canvas). Then run either raw sugar’s the grow pro conditioner or the sensitive one conditioner (i get raw/itchy spots on two sections on my scalp) through all of my hair as if i avoid my roots they get greasy faster or my hair is too dry there and i get breakage. Then squish the conditioner out under hot or slightly cold water (depending on how i feel, a chemist was able to prove water temp does not matter in hair that much), and rinse almost all of the conditioner out. Squish being’s major no-free leave in for 2a-2c into my ends to prevent dryness, and squish hairitage’s play it cool heat protectant all over as I usually have to use heat products to make me look presentable. Lastly, squish in miss jessie’s jelly soft curls soft gel to try to get some definition. I usually just let it air dry as diffusing sometimes makes it worse, but my hair is still bad when I let it air dry. If its too wet (as it gives me sensory issues) i might scrunch the ends with a hair towel (i think its microfiber?).",

      "content": "(The first two photos are today and the rest are going back to August 2025 so you can see how sudden things got bad!!!!!)\n\nI’ve never had to worry about my skin besides the occasional pimple here and there. Starting last year (after I turned 28 and during a super anxious time), I noticed a bunch of closed comedones on my forehead and chalked it up to my high cortisol from anxiety. I was prescribed Cabtreo and sulfur wash but wasn’t super consistent with it and my skin was still pretty chill. Then this August (newly 29 years old) I started breaking out exponentially on my forehead. I have bangs but have for years and it’s never been an issue? I was really consistent with Adapalene and BHA for a couple months this summer but I feel like I just angered my skin barrier and everything got worse. For the last ~3 weeks I’ve been on antibiotics (doxycycline) for the inflammation, Benzyol Peroxide/Climdamycin every morning on spots, and starting November 1st I’ve been using Tretinoin 0.025% every other day using the sandwich method. Otherwise my nightly routine is La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ Gentle Foaming Cleansing Oil, La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser, then Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream. Mornings I just rinse with water and use Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer before/after the benzoyl peroxide. Is this a common thing at 29 years old? I’ve had an IUD for almost 4 years. Besides that nothing major has changed! If anything I’m healthier than I ever have been. Please tell me there’s hope 😭",

      "content": "- Joy pH 5.5 facewash: Gel facewash, affordable, gentle no frills. Full review on my profile. HG, forever repurchase \n\n- Uriage Thermal Water: Expensive water but it wakes me tf up lol. WNRP because I want to get back to a first essence (Missha Time revolution) instead. \n\n- numbuzin no 1 toner: it’s okay, not the most hydrating toner I’ve used but it’s nice. WNRP though because I want something more hydrating.\n\n- cosrx snail mucin: basic but constant in my routine, it’s not a product that wows me everyday but I definitely notice it when it’s missing. It helps with hydration and healing things faster. HG, forever repurchase \n\n- azealic acid: trying to use this for my PIE and PIH. It was very itchy as I was getting accustomed to it but now I’m fine. I actually finished this and am looking to try picspot gel (Aza 15%) since it’s supposed to be better for PIE. \n\n- Supergoop sunscreen: very moisturising sunscreen so it’s also my one and done AM product on lazy days. Not sure how good the sun protection is though since I mainly use it indoors (WFH but have a balcony with sunlight streaming right on my face). MRP\n\n- dr ceruacle kombucha essence: such a delightful product. Really fun to mix it up, super calming to just stare into it lol. Great mix of hydration and moisture in one product, feels luxurious and skin feels instantly smoothened so it’s great under makeup. May not be for extremely dry winter though (the haru haru barrier essence might be a better bet but that’s not easily available in India I guess?). WRP\n\n-Pyunkyang yul eye cream: Idk if it’s doing anything yet because my sleep hygiene has always been terrible and I’m also not fully consistent so time will tell if I will repurchase or not. \n\n- Laneige lip balm and mask: bought these because they are more fun than Vaseline but I think they’re okay. The balm is more hydrating and moistening while the mask is more emollient. For me, just the mask is never enough I need to use something underneath (even if it’s my face moisturiser). Even with both, I find my lips dry in the morning in winter. WNRP, Please suggest better alternatives.\n\nTret: Do NOT use without a derm prescription and guidance. Used it before and saw great but stopped due to eye dryness issues, now I’m super careful with it. I use eye cream as a barrier and place it very carefully outside my entire eye socket area. I also try not to sleep on my side so it doesn’t travel, wash my hands very well after etc. \n\nBioderma crème (missing in picture): I got this because the baume was too much for me sometimes but this is terrible. It’s too greasy in summer and not enough in winter with tret (to be fair, it’s not giving me flakes or anything but I like waking up with a little something on my face in the morning but this completely goes away so ymmv.) WNRP again please drop better night moisturiser suggestions for combo skin on tret that can work year round. \n\nPumpkin sleeping mask: it’s nice, does form a slight gel barrier and locks all my skincare in but it’s not a must have in my routine. \n\n\n",

I could use some assistance!\n\nI usually only buy from the ordinary since it is cheap and hasn’t caused any necessary problems to my skin.\n\n My current routine is -cerave cleanser \nThen glycolic acid 7% toner ordinary \nAnd then the 2% salicylic acid in the brown bottle from the ordinary \nAnd then I use the moisturizing + HA from the ordinary \n\nI ran out of salicylic acid and moisturizer but before I buy new ones I wanted an opinion.\n\nMy skin is both sorta oily and dry, I’d say more on the dry flaky side especially on my nose and around my eyebrows and it ruins my makeup. My pores are quite large and tend to get clogged easily.\n\nI was using this routine in both morning and night and discovered this is probably the reason my skin was dry and textured so I’m not sure what to do? Maybe start doing salicylic acid in the morning and glycolic at nights? But I’d like advice on how to get rid of this skin texture so my makeup can go on smoothly and not dry out and look crusty and dirty  by the end of the day\nI’m only 16 and I find my skin too look almost “old” ",

(eyebrows, upper lip, forehead threading, waxing, facials, hair treatments etc.)\n\nWhat at-home grooming steps do you follow?

      "content": "TLDR: how do I repair my moisture barrier and get rid of post inflammatory marks\n\n\nWriting this at 2 in the morning so sorry if this I post is all over the place. \n\nI have been on a journey (from 18-20 y/o) to get rid of my post inflammatory hyperpigmentation from hormonal acne. I have been to two different dermatologist and feel like I’ve tried everything and my skin barrier has suffered because of it. The only thing that a dermatologist has prescribed me and WORKED was spironolactone and it completely erased my hormonal acne, so again my focus is on PIH. As well as 4 sessions of microneedling a year and a half ago. My issue is the topicals I have been prescribed before (tretinoin 0.025%, adapalene 0.1%, azleiac acid 25%, clindamycin lotion, benzoyl peroxide wash 5% and 10%) have all destroyed my skin and it looks worse now compared to what it look like before i did microneedling.  I’ve been trying to trust the professionals but my skin is not making any improvements. I was told to use adapalene 3x a week and then increase to everyday (derm added  clindamycin lotion a couple weeks ago after I complained of irritation, but my own research did not motivate me to integrate it in my routine), but I can’t even do 1x a week without flaking and having irritated and flaky skin (I always use the sandwich method). How can I fix my moisture barrier and get rid of my PIH?\n\nThis is my current routine that doesn’t irritate my skin (i do this 7 days a week without fail)\n\nMornings \n- cleanse with Cetaphil (dry with daily disposable towels)\n- Dr. Althea 345 cream \n- Cerave lotion \n- Byoma Suncreen SPF 50\n- Makeup\n\nEvenings \n- Gentle makeup wipes \n- Cleanse with Cetaphil( drying with disposable towel)\n- Dr. Althea 345 cream \n- Cerave Lotion or LaRoch Posay triple repair cream ",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",

Maintain your nails.\nTakes barely any effort but instantly makes you look put-together. Clean, trimmed nails = you look like your life is in order even if it’s not 😂\n\n2. Use a loofah/exfoliating gloves in the shower.\nPeople scare you with “it’ll grow mould!!” but if you let it fully dry after every shower, it’s fine. Also, your skin feels actually clean when you remove dead skin regularly.\n\n3.Keep your lips moisturised.\nOne tiny tube of lip balm can save you from looking dehydrated and crusty in 0.2 seconds.\n\n4. Wash your pillowcases more often.\nIt’s literally one of the easiest ways to reduce breakouts and improve skin texture without buying anything.\n\nWhat are your low-effort game-changer tips? 👀✨\n",
