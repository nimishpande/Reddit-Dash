      "content": "This first photo is from the day I got it and the rest is on day three hair. Please give me HONEST opinions. \n\nI have been having the hardest time getting a good hair cut that suits my face. I got fed up with professional hairstylists that told me that they knew how to cut curly hair and give me a lifeless haircut in return. \n\nI did this haircut myself out of frustration. \n\nSo please give me honest feedback. I don’t know if should continue cutting my own hair or if I should continue on the set h for a good curly hair stylist. \n\nAny and all options and advice are appreciated!!! \n\n\nRoutine:\n\nI wash my hair with all about curls shampoo. \n\nI skip conditioner since my hair is so fine and go straight to leave in conditioner. The leave in conditioner I use is the curl smith weightless air dry cream. \n\nWith soaking wet hair I then apply Brad mondo’s wave tech wave foam, which is godsend for anyone that has fine curly hair. It really helps clump my curls together and give them shape and volume without weighing them down.(although the last bottle I got  I noticed a formula change. It’s not as foamy which makes me sad because the foamy was is what helped it apply evenly across my hair)\n\nThe last product I apply is all about curls gel. I stuck it into my hair and then I scrunch my hair with a t-shirt to get out excess moisture and product. \n\nI usually air dry my hair unless I’m going to an event. I’ll defuse for an event just to get more defined curls. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

It hasn’t been bothering me but recently it has started to. It now feels tender.\n\nI went to check it out at the doctors because I’m a woman and although it’s not a bump under the skin but rather ON my skin, it’s still in my armpit so I went to confirm it wasn’t anything concerning. She immediately knew it was an ingrown hair the moment I showed her.\n\nStill, this thing is huge, tender, and I want it gone. I’ve read that a warm compress could help open up the pore. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get rid of this thing?",

It was so annoying having to put the diffuser back on every couple of mins. I didn’t have any elastics big enough so I tried using a shoelace and it worked perfectly. This solution allows me to use the hairdryer without the diffuser too. \n\nI thought about using a rubber band or tape to give the inner rings more grip but I wasn’t sure how they would hold up against the heat in the barrel. \n\nI have 2B-2C hair. My current routine: \n\n• Wash with Tresemme Clean &amp; Natural shampoo every other day\n• Condition with Herbal Essences Hello Hydration and clip my hair while I do my other washing, and shaving, if needed. Comb out knots when I’m ready to rinse\n• Apply LUS All-in-One Styler, about 2-3 pumps, followed by a tennis ball sized thing of Herbal Essences Body Envy mousse, all while standing right side up. I don’t style upside down much anymore \n• Diffuse for about 10 mins and air dry for 45-60 mins\n• Scrunch out the crunch \n",

The marketing sounds great but I don’t want to fall for just fancy wording.\n\nIf you’ve used it, how was your experience?\n\nDid it help with pigmentation or dark spots?\n\nAny improvement in texture or irritation?\n\nWorth the price or just average?\n\nDoes it work like a night cream?\n\nI have combination, sensitive skin with acne / dark spots, so I’m trying to figure out if this is actually effective before buying.\n\nWould love honest reviews!",

Please help me diagnose what I need for a better style. My hair goals are to look less messy (maybe that means more consistent pattern?), reduce frizz, maintain only washing 2x a week.\n\nCurrent routine:\n- using kitch rice water protein solid shampoo bar. Shampoo scalp, rinse with cooler water.\n- using kitch rice water protein solid conditioner bar. Condition from ears to ends and let it sit on hair for 5/10 minutes while I do everything-shower things.\n(Both of these are bars because they travel well/ have low weight but open to other products if needed)\n- comb hair with conditioner in to detangle, rinse with cold water.\n- squeeze out 50% of water in the shower (don’t scrunch)\n- out of shower, section hair in top and bottom + use prayer hands to apply TreLuxe ReFlex. Scrunch in.\n- use teeshirt to remove excess water \n- scrunch in TreLuxe Hi!Definition gel\n- plop hair in teeshirt wrap on top of head for ~10 minutes \n- diffuse to 70%-80% dry\n\nI sleep with hair pineapples and in a silk scarf. I Wash at night so don’t scrunch out - there is no crunch by morning. \n\nHair:\n- bleach highlights done 3/4 times a year\n- I straighten my hair exclusively for 10+ years.\n- Have been wearing exclusively wavy/ curly for 9 months.\n- I wash 2x a week. \n- shower is hard water\n\nLiving in a humid, hot environment with sporadic rain. If anyone has product recs I can get in Thailand, even better but welcome things I can ship to someone in the US to bring.\n\nPhotos are from same wash day \n\n",
