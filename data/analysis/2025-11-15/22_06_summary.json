      "content": "Thanks to this post https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/b8jtf7/black_orchid_large_hair_diffuser_hack_when_it/\n\nI don’t think the OP posts anymore but thank you nonetheless! It was so annoying having to put the diffuser back on every couple of mins. I didn’t have any elastics big enough so I tried using a shoelace and it worked perfectly. This solution allows me to use the hairdryer without the diffuser too. \n\nI thought about using a rubber band or tape to give the inner rings more grip but I wasn’t sure how they would hold up against the heat in the barrel. \n\nI have 2B-2C hair. My current routine: \n\n• Wash with Tresemme Clean &amp; Natural shampoo every other day\n• Condition with Herbal Essences Hello Hydration and clip my hair while I do my other washing, and shaving, if needed. Comb out knots when I’m ready to rinse\n• Apply LUS All-in-One Styler, about 2-3 pumps, followed by a tennis ball sized thing of Herbal Essences Body Envy mousse, all while standing right side up. I don’t style upside down much anymore \n• Diffuse for about 10 mins and air dry for 45-60 mins\n• Scrunch out the crunch \n",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I've been recommended wide-tooth combs a lot, but I can't even pass fingers through my hair. It gets tangled and matted so fast! \n\nMy living conditions are also far from ideal. I work in wildland fire in the summer, and chainsaw work in the winter. So I wear hardhats all the time, in very hot and very cold conditions, I always end up with twigs and branches struck through my hair, which end up damaging my hair when I try to pull it out. \n\nI also live in a dry cabin with a woodstove, so its very dry inside in the winter, and I don't have a regular access to a shower. (I setup a camping shower in the greenhouse this summer and it's been awesome, but it's now winter and I'm not showering outside at -30 😅)\n\nSo far, my routine has been to shampoo, condition and use a detangle brush every time I shower, then air dry. It varies from everyday up to a week between a proper overhead shower. I'm not brand-loyal when it comes to toiletries, but I try to avoid the cheaper brands.\n\nI always wear hats, but I'm hoping for a way to get better coils/waves instead of a giant poof in the back of my head.

I want to try to use this as a healing restart to finally learn how to care for my 4C Haitian hair with love and patience.\n\nI was adopted by a white family when I was a baby, and never really learned how to care for my afro. My family learned how to do box braids, so I’ve just rocked those my whole life. \n\nBut now I could really use some help building a daily/weekly/monthly routine, with affordable product suggestions. I’m also open to beginner-friendly protective style recommendations. \n\nThank you all ahead of time for any feedback.",

We’re in Canada, and I’m not seeing too many skincare advent calendars worth getting. I’m not very familiar with the products anyways but I figured I could make a nicer set with only items that are actually worth getting. Can you please give me some suggestions? I already have a few fat oil lip gloss, some la Roche posay lip cicaplast balms and lipikar baume moisturizer, a charcoal Konjac sponge…so looking for another 15 or so items. Cost is not too much of any issue, I’m ok with spending up to $500. \n\nJust for context on what she likes if it helps…In the past I know we’ve ordered some avene sunscreen from France, some Korean skincare products, she likes la Roche posay and cerave and the ordinary.\n\nI hope this post is allowed, I tried reading the wiki rules and I think I didn’t break any rules….",

I touch up the roots every 3 months and use manic panic or arctic fic interchangeably around every 3 ish weeks to keep the red fresh. Around 4 months ago I did rebleach the pieces to make the switch over to a more vibrant red (I was using a deeper red before). \nI've been debating going from red to blond for these peices for a few months and finally decided to start the process yesterday.\n\nI bleach with the loreal colorista box bleach (its all I had on hand) and left it on for about 45 minutes total. afterwards I used just the little purple conditioner on it it for about 20 minutes and this is the result. You can see my roots lifted as expected, and some parts of the red lightened up to an icy pink tone and others lifted to the normal bleach red tone. The hair feels good still and isn't too horribly damaged.\n\nSo where should I go from here? I am honestly looking to have any tone of blond, like seriously anything from straight bleach yellow blonde to ice white I am fine with, as long as it's all even (for the most part, I'm not expecting this all to be perfectly on tone lmao).\n\nI've considered getting a blue shampoo to put on an leave on and then repeating with a purple shampoo just to see where that gets me without applying more damaging products. I've also considered getting Wella T14 + a 10 vol and just going for it and seeing what happens. But if anyone has suggestions for how to even this out I'd appreciate it! ",

With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry?

It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

I wear Round Lab sunscreen every day and 2 moisturizers (on rotation) that I think suit my skin really well: CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion and Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream. Now i recently ran out of the Round Lab sunscreen and picked up the new American formula, which doesn’t really feel great on me like the Korean formula used to 🫠 So i was thinking of getting some new products to revamp my skincare routine! My concerns right now are:\n\n1. post-hormonal acne scars: i only get one or two annoying pimples once a month but they take FOREVER to fade—i’ve had a post acne scar from the beginning of january and it finally faded a bit 😭\n2. hyperpigmentation around the mouth: i’ve heard wearing sunscreen can help but i’ve been doing that for a few years now and tried various niacinamide products that don’t seem to help much.\n\nfor reference, i’ve got pretty dry skin and try to avoid vitamin C products since they don’t suit my skin. can anyone recommend any products that target hyperpigmentation, fade post acne scars, and sunscreens that are similar to Round Lab’s Korean formula?",

I was wondering if I can use the RedKen Shades EQ hair gloss since it would be the least damaging- my hair is already fried + super thin (genetics unfortunately). Would hair gloss be strong enough to dye it? I’m not sure what level my natural hair is and what shade to use either if anyone can help with that lol. I included some very old pictures of my virgin hair at the end that’s all I can find lol. I’m not sure if it’s cool or neutral, but since I have copper hair rn and it’s already “warm” would getting ashy brown dye work on “canceling it out” lol idk what I’m talking about, but I want to be able to do this at home. And I’m not really interested in blending my roots I just want brown hair again. Which brown… is the question.. appreciate any help! :,)",

Please help me diagnose what I need for a better style. My hair goals are to look less messy (maybe that means more consistent pattern?), reduce frizz, maintain only washing 2x a week.\n\nCurrent routine:\n- using kitch rice water protein solid shampoo bar. Shampoo scalp, rinse with cooler water.\n- using kitch rice water protein solid conditioner bar. Condition from ears to ends and let it sit on hair for 5/10 minutes while I do everything-shower things.\n(Both of these are bars because they travel well/ have low weight but open to other products if needed)\n- comb hair with conditioner in to detangle, rinse with cold water.\n- squeeze out 50% of water in the shower (don’t scrunch)\n- out of shower, section hair in top and bottom + use prayer hands to apply TreLuxe ReFlex. Scrunch in.\n- use teeshirt to remove excess water \n- scrunch in TreLuxe Hi!Definition gel\n- plop hair in teeshirt wrap on top of head for ~10 minutes \n- diffuse to 70%-80% dry\n\nI sleep with hair pineapples and in a silk scarf. I Wash at night so don’t scrunch out - there is no crunch by morning. \n\nHair:\n- bleach highlights done 3/4 times a year\n- I straighten my hair exclusively for 10+ years.\n- Have been wearing exclusively wavy/ curly for 9 months.\n- I wash 2x a week. \n- shower is hard water\n\nLiving in a humid, hot environment with sporadic rain. If anyone has product recs I can get in Thailand, even better but welcome things I can ship to someone in the US to bring.\n\nPhotos are from same wash day \n\n",
