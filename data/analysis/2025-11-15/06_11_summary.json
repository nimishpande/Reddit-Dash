      "content": "Tried posting this in the wavy hair subreddit as my hair texture varies from a lose curl to a sad wave, but they keep removing my posts/ wouldn’t allow new ones to go through. Im hoping that someone knows how to deal with this.\n\nThis is my natural hair with the waves and everything, just a small amount of product. About 2a-2c on a good day? Why is it that no matter what I do the top of my head refuses to have any texture? I have the same issue with some other parts of my hair and then the mid section is incredibly wavy/curly. No matter what I do my hair ends up like this and im not confident wearing it like this in public — it looks greasy. I already have layers cut into my hair to try to reduce weight and use very minimal product. It gets actually greasy fast so I usually have to wash my hair every day or every other day. I have used so many different products and I get the same results no matter what I do. Am i just screwed to have hair that doesn’t work with me?\n\nMy routine: shampoo with either raw sugar’s moisture smoothie shampoo or the truly unruly shampoo (all over, my hair hates product buildup and I need a clean canvas). Then run either raw sugar’s the grow pro conditioner or the sensitive one conditioner (i get raw/itchy spots on two sections on my scalp) through all of my hair as if i avoid my roots they get greasy faster or my hair is too dry there and i get breakage. Then squish the conditioner out under hot or slightly cold water (depending on how i feel, a chemist was able to prove water temp does not matter in hair that much), and rinse almost all of the conditioner out. Squish being’s major no-free leave in for 2a-2c into my ends to prevent dryness, and squish hairitage’s play it cool heat protectant all over as I usually have to use heat products to make me look presentable. Lastly, squish in miss jessie’s jelly soft curls soft gel to try to get some definition. I usually just let it air dry as diffusing sometimes makes it worse, but my hair is still bad when I let it air dry. If its too wet (as it gives me sensory issues) i might scrunch the ends with a hair towel (i think its microfiber?).",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I have naturally dry skin, like it can feel tight and flaky sometimes, and now I’m really starting to see the deeper lines forming on my forehead and around my eyes. They’re getting kinda bad, tbh. Up until now, my \"routine\" was basically just splashing water on my face in the shower. I'm a total newbie. I’m trying to find something that actually works for smoothing out those deep wrinkles and helping with the dryness, but I need it to be super simple. I don't want a 10-step process or a ton of different bottles. What are the absolute must-haves for a guy who just wants to stop his face from getting more like a raisin? cleanser, something for wrinkles, and sunscreen? Is that all I need to start? Any advice on keeping it simple but effective would be huge. Thanks!",

I’ve never really had a consistent skincare routine so I’m looking for some advice on where to start. \n\nSome background about my skin: I’m very fair, get occasional hormonal breakouts when on my periods, I spend a lot of time outdoors and feel like I have lines from squinting. I don’t wear any makeup unless on special occasions. Also I’m currently breastfeeding so not sure if that might affect some recommendations. \n\nI’m looking for any and all help with where to start in creating a routine/getting some products! I generally lean very “clean” and natural when it comes to putting things on/in my body. \n\nThanks in advance for any help!",
