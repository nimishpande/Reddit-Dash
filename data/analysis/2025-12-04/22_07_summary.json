      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

She told me the hand situation is eczema. Prescribed me a steroid cream but I haven't used it so far. Probably won't use it. \n\n\n- Added a pinch of salt in my water bottles daily. 2-3L water w lemon and salt.\n\n- I drank coconut water in the morning. 2-3 days only. \n\n- Moisturized a LOTTTTT. Used CeraVe cream. Bioderma atoderm. \n\n- Amd I avoided washing my hands more than necessary.\n\n\nThe sandpaper-y texture near the valley of fingers has gone down 70%. Hands feel normal again. Knuckles feel not as raw and scale-y as earlier.\n\n\nI don't know what worked but yeah my hands don't burn or feel streched near the knuckles anymore.",

      "content": "I'm in my early twenties and get told regularly that I look as if I'm still freshly in high school. I noticed that I have a lot of features that just make me look a lot younger than my age group, such as having a much smaller nose, rounder face, and big round eyes. This really bothers me though because I don't like it when others call me a baby or need to ask me for my ID to prove if I'm legally old enough for certain things. Even when I tell people that I'm in my 3rd year of college they cannot believe it, or when I mention that I have my own place since they assume I'm a little teenager. I'm not that tall either, so that doesn't help. On the contrary, my boyfriend is only a year older but actually looks his age, so people don't really assume he is younger than what he is. I don't want to do anything to my face that would damage it since I like how I look and know that I would age well with my young-looking features. But, I do really want to find something to make me look my age. I don't like having people give me weird looks and ask my age constantly-- I find it pretty bothersome and rude for people to ask of my age, but at the same time I understand why they would. Are there any makeup tricks to at least help me look more my age?",

      "content": "Sorry this is a long one so please bear with me! Pictures are from march 2024, April 2024, and today. Obviously something triggered this after that first pic, not sure what but it’s gotten worse and worse :( When I first started to get the bumps I got triple cream from Curology (ivermectin, azaleaic acid, and metro gel). I’d get purging and then clear skin for a day, then bumps again, but since the redness persisted I stopped using it. Got convinced I had fungal acne last month, so I looked for fungal acne safe creams and used Purito Oat in Calming Gel… BIG mistake. Woke up more red and broken out than ever, and it’s been like this ever since. I started using ketoconazale to treat fungal acne, which wasn't really working, until I looked at my skin under a blacklight and it was a coral color all over my t zone (bacterial, not fungal). Now, EVERYTHING makes me feel red, tight, or itchy. I tried going back to Vanicream in the tub since it’s what I’ve used for years, but now that makes me itchy, hot, and red. I tried Sebamed Care Gel and Eucerin healing cream, but both make me flush and itch! The only things that don’t cause a reaction (that I can see or feel) are:\n\n* Vanicream gel cleanser\n* Uriage Cica Daily Gel (so expensive lol)\n* SKIN 1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n* Diaper rash cream (literally the ONLY thing that calms my skin immediately, Ive been wearing at night) \n* Haven’t worn sunscreen in forever because I know it’ll burn\n\nMy skin gets so angry without a moisturizer, and yet I feel like the Uriage gel isn’t enough. Literally what do I do?? Do I need to treat this with medicine? Or, if my skin barrier is broken, what else do I need to do to heal it? My dermatologist basically threw like 5 actives at me and told me to use them at the same time (which got me into this mess in the first place, so I didn’t listen to him). Any advice is welcome :(",

Before these were just small itchy bumps and now I see pus filled acne. I don't know what to use. I live in gurgaon and haven't came across any good dermat with decent fee. All the dermat I've been to has made my skin worse. These bumps are also leaving marks and I'm not poppping them.

Some of it seems to be in the form of closed comedones, and the texture of the skin is bad as well.\n\nI currently use tazarotene and azelaic acid as the only actives in my routine (2-3 times a week each) a cetaphil gentle cleanser, sunscreen(boj/skin1004), barrier repair moisturizer (aestura and atoderm) and oil cleanser occasionally. I used tretinoin before and faced the same issue.\n\nThough right now I'm going through a little bit of a purge due to increasing taz concentration, apart from the active acne on my forehead, it's usually what it looks like. I have used a lot of different products and actives in my routine and the one thing that's stayed the same is my forehead, even when the rest of my skin was good, and I'm not sure how to fix it for good. I have seb derm in my scalp, though I'm not sure if its related.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar issues before and has any suggestions or advice it'd be much appreciated. I think l've covered everything here but may make an edit if i can add more context. Thank you!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
