      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

It tends to be itchy half the time, and it’s inflamed and some look like there’s balls of blood underneath the surface of my skin. I’m not fully sure what the cause is, at first I thought it was my medication, but after I lowered the dosage, my acne still got worse. Could be my diet? Unsure. \nMy dermatologist canceled on me so I have to wait a whole month and I’m pretty upset about it. My face makes me insanely insecure and I’m not sure how to fix it. Googling just says this type of acne needs professional help. \nMy current routine is using 10% BPO Cerave day and night. Was using differin as well but I recently stopped a few days ago. Not sure if that was a good idea cause I can’t tell if it was helping or not. I also use the lightweight cerave daily moisturizer. I also saw that washing my face with a cleanser at night and then only rinsing with water in the mornings is good.\nA few years ago when I went to the dermatologist, they recommended me tretinoin and that seemed to work but eventually I ran out and didn’t need it after 2 years. Unfortunately my acne came back unexpectedly. Might go on that again but just wondering what steps can I do myself to better my acne cause I’m so tired and I get so insecure making eye contact with others cause of it.\n\nWhat can I do to clear this up? \nThank you!",

I feel like the big issue is I'm not using the right products, but I also don't have money right now for more professional products that will get better results.\n\nWhat would you suggest? Right now my hair goals are for it to be smoother, softer, and maybe even help with grown and volume/thickness. I've also been shedding A LOT to the point I'm surprised I have hair left. I would like help with the shedding and maybe even help encourage new growth. Routine suggestions would be great as well.\n\nCurrently I don't have a fixed hair product, but I don't use heat on my hair at all and I hair/towel dry my hair. I used to dye it but the last time I dyed it was probably 2-3 years ago and all the dyed hair has been cut off.\n\nI'm just frustrated because my hair quality used to be REALLY GOOD, very fine and soft but it's gotten more concerning to me within the last year or so.\n\nTL:DR My hair quality is getting worse and I need recommendations for it to start feeling stronger, fuller and softer again without absolutely breaking my bank. I'm willing to put the money in if it will actually work for my hair and get the results I'm looking for.",

      "content": "\nokay this is gonna be a super long explanation-  i want to get to the bottom of this because ive tried so many things and i cant find a solution!!!!! my hair used to be way more curly than now, it has become SIGNIFICANTLY less curly and i really loved the curls and i want that texture back. im just going to go chronologically and explain how the texture has changed.\n\n- this is WAY BACK but just in case it has significance i wanted to mention it. when i was born up until i was like 5 by hair was very curly, big fat ringlets, curlier than any pictures shown here.\n- around 5 it slowly started to become more and more straight. my hair was super super straight with little to no waviness- straighter than any of these pictures!\n- at 12 i cut my hair very short (like \"boy hair cut\" short) and it became curly again! i had big fatttt ringlets every single day- when it grew to a stage where i could do pigtails, if i put them in while my hair was still a little damp, each pigtail would form a single perfect, fat ringlet. never used any product and wouldnt even scrunch it or anything!!\n- i continued to let it grow and got trims every once and a while, it was still really  really curly!!! (pics 1-4) never used ANY product, i let my hair air dry and would sometimes scrunch it but most of the time i would just let it be\n- i had colored hair for a while and i bleached all of my hair a SINGLE time and only did root touch ups about 2 times total. i only ever used conditioner based dyes when dying my hair. the damage caused it to become SLIGHTLY less curly, i had less ringlets than before, BUT it was still very curly and i really like how it looked at this point! (pics 5-8) never used ANY product, i let my hair air dry and would sometimes scrunch it but most of the time i would just let it be\n- i decided to get my hair cut short. this caused it to be way way way less curly and i still am so perplexed by why this happened because i thought my curls would thrive in short layers since they had previously??? (pic 9)\n- now im jumping like 2-3 years from then to now because i have just been struggling with trying everything i could to bring my curls back. when my hair is completely wet and i scrunch it with no product, it is decently curly, and getting my hair to stay that curly when it is dry would satisfy me even if its not as ideal as my old curl pattern (photos 10-11) \n- after my hair looks like it does in those photos, if i let it air dry it becomes mostly straight with a slight wave. if i dont use any product, but diffuse it, it does the same. if i use foam mousse and let it air dry, it is SLIGHTLY more wavy, but never super curly. if i use my foam mousse and plop it into a t shirt to dry, its a good bit more wavy. if i use the foam mousse and diffuse it, its wavy but curly in some spots, but never close to the amount of curl i used to have, and not even as curly as it is when i scrunch my wet hair now with no product. (photos 12-15)\n- i know this part might not be able to be helped, but i honestly really hate having to do any sort of hair routine because it takes a lot of time out of my day, and i have to wash my hair every other day because my roots get super oily super fast(yes i have tried training it or whatever, it hasnt worked, its just my genes that cause this.) when i do do more than just scrunching it with no product, i most often use mousse and plop my hair in a t shirt- i almost never have time for diffusing it. i dont understand how a routine is required to get my curls to show now, and it wasnt a few years ago. i really just want that back☹️ but if that's not possible, im open to other low maintenance recommendations \n\nother details that have a possibility of being relevant???:\n\n- ive tried a lot of other curl products aside from foam mousse, like curl creams, sprays leave in conditioners, etc, and nothing has worked as well as it\n- when i go on vacation by the ocean, my hair tends to be more curly, but i have tried sea salt spray and it does something but the effect isnt very significant \n- my hair responds horribly to gels and stuff like that- i think it's because it gets weighed down. even when it was at its most curly i tried gel a few times and it made it a lot less curly.\n- for all of the haircuts ive gotten since my hair stopped being curly, i have specifically asked for a layered haircut that would take weight off and engance my curls, ive been to a fee different hairdressers and idk if they are like not doing something that needs to be done, dont know how to help me, are doing as much as they can, or what??\n- im most successful with scrunching my hair when it is dripping wet. i scrunch it until it stops dripping and then scrunch it once lightly with a t shirt. if my hair is damp and not wet, it does not curl a lot when i scrunch it.\n- i have tried to look for hairdressers that have good reviews about curly hair specifically, but they are really hard for me to find in the area and even those ones have resulted the same. i dont have the money to be paying someone who specializes in curly hair because theyre always like 50+ dollars over what i am comfortable spending\n- the mousse that has worked for me is the pattern brands foam mousse\n\nthis is all i can think of, i hope someone out there can help me because ive been struggling to figure this out for SO LONG..",

It’s lightweight, absorbs quickly, and never feels greasy, which makes it great for daily use or under makeup. It’s gentle and affordable, so it’s one of those products you don’t feel bad slathering on. The downside is that it’s not super rich, so in colder weather it might not be enough on its own, and it definitely doesn’t help with oil control if you’re on the oilier side. But here’s what surprised me the most: whenever my skin suddenly gets red or irritated, I put two or three pumps on at night as a thick layer and seal it with Vaseline. Every time I do this, I wake up with the redness noticeably reduced. So overall, it’s a reliable, no-drama moisturizer that works well for everyday hydration, even if you might need something heavier for extreme dryness.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
