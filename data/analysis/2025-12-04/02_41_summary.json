      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Please ignore my face in them. I took these just to track my hair and never thought I’d be posting them 😬\n\nI only found out I had curly/semi-curly hair a couple months ago after literally years of blow-drying it straight. So I’m still figuring everything out and honestly I feel like half the time I have no clue what I’m doing. I get some decent results but it’s inconsistent and I know the routine probably needs work. I really like the look and I feel like it could be way better.\n\nHere’s my routine right now:\n\n**Right after shower (still dripping):**\n\n1. Quick rake-through\n2. Distilled water mist\n3. Light rake and shake for clumps\n4. SheaMoisture Curl and Shine spray\n5. Another light rake and shake\n6. 50/50 mix of Hairstory Hair Balm + OUAI Curl Cream\n7. Final rake and shake\n8. Scrunch\n\n*I do almost all the rake-and-shake/scrunching upside down so gravity helps the curls form.*\n\n**Drying:**\n\n* Diffuse about 80-90 percent dry, moving around to avoid overheating anything\n* Let the last little bit air dry\n\n**Finishing:**\n* Very gentle lift at the roots to break the cast without ruining the curls\n* Small amount of Based Styling Powder for volume/hold\n* Tiny bit of hairspray (Kenra 25 or 35)\n\n\n\nStuff I’m confused on and hoping for advice about:\n\n* Am I doing the rake and shake too early?\n* When should styling powder actually be used? Before scrunching, after, only when dry?\n* Does my product order make sense or am I mixing things wrong?\n* Any tips to get bigger clumps?\n* Better diffusing tips for hair that’s around 6-7 inches long?\n* Anything in the pics that jumps out as an obvious fix?\n* Any reference or inspo photos with similar hair is greatly appreciated  \n\nI appreciate any help. Just trying to go from “decent” to “actually good” and not screw this up lol",

It tends to be itchy half the time, and it’s inflamed and some look like there’s balls of blood underneath the surface of my skin. I’m not fully sure what the cause is, at first I thought it was my medication, but after I lowered the dosage, my acne still got worse. Could be my diet? Unsure. \nMy dermatologist canceled on me so I have to wait a whole month and I’m pretty upset about it. My face makes me insanely insecure and I’m not sure how to fix it. Googling just says this type of acne needs professional help. \nMy current routine is using 10% BPO Cerave day and night. Was using differin as well but I recently stopped a few days ago. Not sure if that was a good idea cause I can’t tell if it was helping or not. I also use the lightweight cerave daily moisturizer. I also saw that washing my face with a cleanser at night and then only rinsing with water in the mornings is good.\nA few years ago when I went to the dermatologist, they recommended me tretinoin and that seemed to work but eventually I ran out and didn’t need it after 2 years. Unfortunately my acne came back unexpectedly. Might go on that again but just wondering what steps can I do myself to better my acne cause I’m so tired and I get so insecure making eye contact with others cause of it.\n\nWhat can I do to clear this up? \nThank you!",

Since I only have access to a limited number of options, I figured asking here might help in my search.\n\nI’m especially touch-sensitive, and the feeling of oil on my skin—whether it’s lotion, sunscreen, concealer, or otherwise—drives me up a wall. I genuinely can’t stand it. This wouldn’t be such a big issue if I didn’t work in the marine science field, but because I do, finding a sunscreen that works for me is critical. I work long hours in the sun and in wet environments, so wearing sunscreen is necessary for safety.\n\nI’ve considered powder sunscreen in the past, but since I’m in frequent contact with water, I’m unsure how effective it would be. It would likely wash off and be impossible to reapply while wet. On top of that, it’s pretty expensive for the amount you get, and I need close to full-body coverage since I work in a fishing shirt and shorts. I’ve also used a number of “dry touch” and “non-greasy” sunscreens from big box stores, but I haven’t found a single one that lives up to their claims. \n\nIf possible, I’d also like to find one that’s reef-safe since many of the chemicals in sunscreen are really bad for aquatic life, but I’d take something that won’t trigger my touch-sensitivity, since I’d be less likely to just not apply it.",

I’m also looking for moisturizer suggestions that would suit acne-prone, normal-to-dry skin. Do you guys think this routine makes sense, or is there something better he should use?

It’s lightweight, absorbs quickly, and never feels greasy, which makes it great for daily use or under makeup. It’s gentle and affordable, so it’s one of those products you don’t feel bad slathering on. The downside is that it’s not super rich, so in colder weather it might not be enough on its own, and it definitely doesn’t help with oil control if you’re on the oilier side. But here’s what surprised me the most: whenever my skin suddenly gets red or irritated, I put two or three pumps on at night as a thick layer and seal it with Vaseline. Every time I do this, I wake up with the redness noticeably reduced. So overall, it’s a reliable, no-drama moisturizer that works well for everyday hydration, even if you might need something heavier for extreme dryness.",

I didn’t really have a proper hair care routine, I was a kid. Didn’t care at all just used stuff lol. I started birth control at 19, and about 3 years later  my curls disappeared. All new hair had replaced it. I chopped it off hoping something would happen— straight/wavy.  Mortified. After that, for the past few years did a few hair masks, including castor oil masks once in a while (I also put a few drops in my shampoo) got better hair products, all the things. I have a few ringlets now mostly at the root, spirals downward, then literally one straight section at the bottom. I cut it often and it doesn’t change. I miss my hair— will I ever get it back? It’s healthier than ever, thicker strands and all. Right now I use the Mane  choice “the alpha” shampoo and conditioner, Camille rose curl love moisture milk leave in, ALL ABOUT CURL curl cream and mouse, hair oil. I diffuse my hair on cool, use a  microfiber towel. Do the whole Shazam while my hair is wet. \n\nSorry the first couple of pics are so blurry, they’re from a 10 year old snap lol.",
