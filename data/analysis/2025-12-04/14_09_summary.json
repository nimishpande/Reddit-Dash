      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "For context I’m a 20yrs old woman and have never had such bad acne until recently. I haven’t had any acne throughout my teens until my late teens around 18yrs old. At first it wasn’t that bad a few bumps a month, spots showing up and leaving, things of that nature until around the age of 19 where I’ve started to have the worst flare ups ever. Monthly my acne worsens around my chin, forehead, and cheeks. At first when it started I thought it was because of my weight loss. When I finally lost the weight around 18 I thought it was my hormones regulating that caused the acne, but I’m not sure anymore. It’s honestly so horrible and what makes it worse is that I have very sensitive skin while also having certain areas that overproduce oil (my forehead and nose) and my face is very sensitive when it comes to any products. During winter I suffer from dryness around my cheeks and they begin to flake. I’ve been trying to get into skincare but nothing is working. When I mention it to my mom she claims it’s hormones as well and it will eventually go away since I was late hitting puberty I think it may be a late acne spree now, but again I’m not sure. The acne around my chin won’t go away and the cleanser I’m using makes the problem worse I think but I’m not sure. I use “The Beauty of Joseon” products like their double cleansing set, their AHP BHA toner and moisturizer, while also sometimes using a Aztec clay mask and a CeraVe cleanser bar for oily skin, but they don’t seem to help. I can’t use their (BOJ) Ginseng products because it starts to burn my face super bad and I’ve even suffered from chemical burns before, other products also cause this reaction. I workout almost everyday and get 4-6 hours of sleep 3-4 days a week while getting around 8-10 hours for the remainder of the week and it interchanges because of work. I drink 2-3 bottles of water a day and try to eat relatively healthy foods. Can anyone recommend anything to help or is this normal? Any products I should try out or avoid?",

My lips are a bit \"deflated\" and have some wrinkles, which I am guessing is mostly a result of aging.\n\nI was very ill for four years and I am too scared to be one of the people who get side effects/symptoms from botox or fillers.\n\nI've tried drinking more water and am still working on making sure I drink enough each day. I use Laneige Lip Mask every night after putting hyaluronic acid serum on my lips and I find it's helped a little. Probably no more than any decent lip moisturizer but I also love the smell and feel of it and that helps me always remember to put it before bed. \n\nI use The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2%  peeling solution on my face but not on my lips. Is there anything like that for lips I should be using? Or are lips too sensitive for exfoliation like that? (I am assuming they are but figured I would ask.)\n\nThank you! 💜",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
