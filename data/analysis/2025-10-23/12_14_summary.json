I don't have an income so I get what I can. I only air dry, I don't have a diffuser. just a dryer with no attachments. if I gel I will put it up in a cheap bonnet for 10-15 so I'm not dripping water everywhere.

I also seem to completely miss the back of my hair when I make extra sure I get gel back there... I wonder if I'm doing it wrong or if my bonnet is absorbing it? \n\nI also have autism and the feel of gel in my hair makes my skin crawl. so I don't usually gel. \n\nis there anything I can try doing different? my budget is insanely tight so I can't spend more than $15-$20 on products. \n\nthanks in advance.",

I’ve also bleached and dyed my hair a few times. But tell me is my hair actually seeing some improvement or am I being delusional I really don’t know to trust my judgment bc I asked my sister and she isn’t entirely convinced about any of my hair texture and says I “might have wavy hair” \n\nI use Pantene sheer volume shampoo for well shampooing it and I do it twice, after that I use the shampoo sheer volume conditioner, I finger brush through my hair to get the tangled and then I use a brush to comb all the products into my hair thoroughly, once I rinse the conditioner I used a leave in conditioner called “kinky curly knot today” and rake that through my hair, which I’m again finger combing it to get the tangled out, after basically lathering it through all hair and detangling I brush again to get it really deep in the scalp. After that I use curl gel called “not your mothers sculpting gel” so I rake it in alll over, after coating all the layers through, I shake my head a little, I lift my my hair up a few times and then I start to scrunch, now for drying I plopped my hair by tying it a t-shirt, and then waited for 20 minutes, after that I micro plop for 15 or so minutes but I’m thinking of doing it for less time and after micro plopping I just diffused it in a specific\n\n\nNow as for the routine I did a few nights ago I only changed up my diffusing a tad, didn’t plop or microplop and just diffused. Also I will admit I do not have heat protectant spray but I don’t diffuse all that often tbh. I also finger coiled my hair in sections that night but idk how well it works with wavy hair (or possibly even loose curly hair? Idk)  my hair is thick with fine strands.\n\n\nDoes my hair even have a possibility of getting curlier? Any and all constructive criticism is allowed and encouraged Im still a beginner to this all ",

      "content": "Hello, I really want to bleach and dye my hair to this dusty pink color, but I'm not sure if that would be possible to do because of my hair history. I originally had bleached blonde strips on my virgin hair as shown in the pics attached, and then I had to color it brown (at a salon) for work a few months later. I'm pretty sure the hairstylist used some black dye shades to cover a skunk strip I had to make sure it wouldn't show up.\n\nA few months later, I boxed dyed it permanent red hair dye, but it didn't even show up, so my hair looks the same as the last picture attached. I would prefer not to go to a salon, as that would definitely be too expensive for me. So, should I use a color remover first before bleaching? Or just go for it with 20 vol bleach? Or wait for it to grow out a few years before trying? I'm also fine with having stripey tones of different pink throughout the hair if it's not possible to avoid. Honestly any advice or thoughts are appreciated, thank you!",

I'm fairly a lower middle class guy who's recently dived into skincare routine. And being learning how to use the products affectively at low cost.\n\nMy current product stack :\n- Pond's Super Light gel\n- Joy Hello Sun Tinted Sunscreen \n- DermaTouch Salicylic 2% facewash \n- Minimalist 9% AHA + 1% BHA serum\n- Tretin 0.05%\n\nI moisturize the moment I come out of bath. Slap sunscreen twice (once at morning, again after lunch). Tretinoin every alternate night. \n\nWhere I did a mistake, was to misjudge the frequency of cleansing and exfoliating. I used to pretty much cleanse at the morning before first sunscreen application, then at noon before 2nd application, then again at night before the active. It was freaking 2% salicylic acid, so most of the times I suffered from the dryness &amp; oilyness rebound cycles throughout the days, weeks &amp; months. 3 times a day ! My routine itself was the culprit for what I thought of fixing it. And then the serum twice every week. It was already a lot of barrier damage, triggering red acne bumps, flaky skin &amp; oil rebounds.\n\nTHE FIX :\n\nI've now toned down my cleanser usage to just at night. Being only water rinsing at daytime when I get oily from sunscreen application. Reduced serum to only once a week. And started applying moisturizer only when I feel my skin is about to get dry.\n\nThe results were fantastic ! With the same product stack, all of my acne vanished. The barrier isn't inflamed anymore. And it's thickened a lot, with less open pores.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR : Reduced cleanser frequency to just once everyday and my obsession with over cleansing habit. And fixed my flaky inflamed red skin with red acne bumps.",

I tried writing a mail to nykaa but it isn’t reaching them. There’s no ‘Have a concern’ option either. \nI’m thinking of doing a patch test to see if it irritates my skin and if not ill just use it. \n\n\n I just feel overwhelmed because this has never happened before and i don’t know how to deal w it:/\n\nalso, I’m new to reddit",
