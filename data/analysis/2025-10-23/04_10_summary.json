      "content": "\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm Suyog, 34 years old. I wanted to share my 5-month update after finally taking the plunge for a hair transplant earlier this year.\n\nBefore going ahead, I had actually consulted one of the top clinics in India ‚Äî the kind everyone recommends when you search online. But somehow, I wasn‚Äôt convinced with the cookie-cutter approach they suggested. My baldness had been stable for quite some time, and I wanted something customized and artistic, not just a generic dense-pack.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I came across some really honest and detailed discussions here on Reddit‚Äôs Hair Transplant community. Reading through patient feedback and doctor reviews gave me the confidence to look beyond the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù names and focus on skill, design sense, and ethics.\n\nLong story short ‚Äî I found a surgeon in Patna who completely understood what I wanted: a natural, 3-peaked frontal hairline with temporal point enhancement that would suit my face and age.\n\nüå± The Journey So Far\n\nIt‚Äôs been 5 months since the procedure, and I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm at about 60% growth right now. The remaining 40% should fill in over the next few months. Even at this stage, the hairline looks super natural, and the temporal points blend beautifully ‚Äî exactly what I hoped for.\n\nI‚Äôm honestly thrilled with the outcome so far, especially knowing this is just the partial result.\n\nüôè A Note of Gratitude\n\nA big shout-out to this Reddit community ‚Äî without your posts, before-after pictures, and candid feedback, I might have gone for marketing hype instead of real artistry. You guys unknowingly guided me toward the right hands.\n\nWill post my full 8‚Äì12 month update later with detailed pictures once the growth completes.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything about my experience ‚Äî happy to give back to the same community that helped me so much!\n\n",

I've been struggling with skincare for years, fell for more than one \"miracle cures\" now I can smell this BS from a mile away.\n\nThe amount of sponsored content I'm seeing on Insta and TikTok about beef tallow being some magic skincare ingredient is disturbing. These influencers are literally getting paid to lie through their teeth about how \"life-changing\" rubbing cow fat on their face has been. It's so obvious that big animal agriculture is trying to create a new market for their waste products by marketing to vulnerable people desperate to clear their skin up.\n\nNot to mention with RFK now saying stupid dumb stuff like \"make tallow great again\", i've had enough.\n\nWhat really gets me is how they frame it as this \"natural, ancestral\" solution while completely ignoring that there are plant-based alternatives that work just as well¬†*if not better*¬†without supporting an industry that's destroying our planet. Shea butter, coconut oil, jojoba oil all amazing for skin and none of them require animal suffering.\n\nI've been down the rabbit hole of researching this and it's basically just another way for the meat industry to monetize every single part of the animal. They create the waste, then convince people it's a premium skincare ingredient. It's honestly genius marketing but absolutely disgusting ethics.",

But I‚Äôve been diligently growing my hair out with the hopes of finally embracing the curls again (I prefer long curls on me)!\n\nMy one non-negotiable is keeping the length, no trim necessary quite yet. At this point when the curls are happy it looks good, I think I only need a little shaping, face framing, some curly curtain bangs and some layering around the cheek to eye level. What do you think would look best on me? I believe my head shape to be square-square/oval and feel a bit insecure about a fuller jaw area, so I feel that bringing more attention higher on my head will help with that? I do really like curly shags, especially more wolf cut less mullet for myself :) I love feminine, ethereal, natural, lived in vibes!\n\nThis routine was pretty simple, I washed with Garnier Whole Blends Honey Treasures shampoo and Camille Rose Guava Slip conditioner. I dried with a T-shirt then applied Ouai hair oil, finger coiled front an some other top pieces and diffused mostly dry, then air dried the rest of the way.",

Skincare product and routine recommendations, questions, random tips, even just helping me to figure out WHAT is wrong!!!\n\nThe red dots are not bumpy and they do not hurt. They are completely smooth all-over, and they don‚Äôt develop into acne (although I do GET real acne, but not nearly as much as I used to). They are just persistently *there* all over my cheeks and jawline. They don‚Äôt extend to the middle of my face, nose, or forehead (although those areas are still just a bit red in general).\n\nMy skin is combination, it is super oily along the T-zone (and also my cheeks) but my jawline extending into my cheeks, can be dry or regular. My skin is highly sensitive, and I believe I might have a damaged skin barrier??\n\nMy current skincare routine (all from The Ordinary) are:\n\nMORNING:\n- Cream cleanser\n- Milky toner\n- Cream moisturiser (first moisturiser that doesn‚Äôt make me break out)\n- Sunscreen (different brand, Australian)\n- LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING GOOD, BUT LOOKING VERY RED COMPARED TO WHEN I WOKE UP\n\nEVENING:\n- oil-to-balm makeup remover (Australian brand again)\n- oil-to-balm cleanser\n- salicylic acid serum\n- Cream moisturiser (stings when I use after the acid)\n\nI wear a lot of makeup, but these skin issues started well before that.

I also do get bumps ?comedones - not sure if I need more chemical exfoliation or to be more consistent with oil cleansing.\n\nI currently MOSTLY use the same routine for both AM and PM (Korean x Japanese products mainly)\n\nAM\n- Senka perfect whip (works best w my skin as it doesnt strip)\n- innisfree green tea seed serum\n- innisfree green tea seed cream (both innisfree products I've been using for years and have been happy with but happy to upgrade)\n- la roche anthelios invisible fluid for sunscreen (previously used beauty of joseon but it left me feeling quite oily?)\n\nPM (im working on double cleansing more but don't do it daily):\n- if double cleansing: kose softymo deep cleansing oil\n- senka perfect whip\n- innisfree green tea seed serum\n- innisfree green tea seed cream\n- paula's choice BHA 2% liquid exfoliant (i used to use this for both AM and PM which may be overkill so ive stopped for a couple of weeks now and only leave it for 1x a day)\n\nEssentially, I'm looking for suggestions for my routine - whether it's product or routine related.

      "title": "I have CURLY hair. No I do NOT want layers. Anyone relate to my story?",
      "content": "\nI spent my entire life with all sorts of layers, haircuts, colors. I started dying and cutting my hair all sorts of ways starting at 13. I am 26 now. I was always jealous of girls with flowing, luscious long hair who didn't have to think about how they were going to get their weird layers to lay correctly. I decided to do a big chop 3 years ago to get rid of any last fried bleached hair so I could finally start growing it out to be the long princess hair that I was always jealous of. I was getting haircuts every few months but every hair dresser I went to would not do what I asked even remotely. It started getting so frustrating that I stopped going 2 years ago. For the last year I have just been letting my hair grow and I am only about 1 year away from my length goal that I have dreamed of my whole life. I even spent thousands on extentions when I was 18 to have this length, but they never matched my texture and I gave up on that. \n\nEven though I haven't use any heat at all in one year, unfortunately  I have a lot of split ends from not caring for my hair in ways that I was ignorant of like hard water and the type of brush I was using. I realized if I don't get them cut I will end up losing way more hair than I want to. I did 2 months of research before I finally found a curly hair specialist. I was extremely excited for her to help my hair. I told her I only want 1 inch off, no layers and to fix my bangs and face framing pieces that I have been cutting myself. She asked me multiple times why I was wanting her to do my hair that she specializes in curly cuts and I am not wanting a curly cut. I said because she understands curly hair and she would cut my hair correctly. She said she doesn't understand why I wouldn't go to a cheaper hair dresser who isn't known for curly cuts. She said that unless I want layers she would not be cutting my hair how she recommends. I said I am growing my hair and I refuse to have layers. She asked if i ever had layers before. I said most of my life. She said \"well you haven't had my layers\" . I said I don't care if layers make my hair more curly, I just want long hair with healthy curls coming out. She kept pointing to all the parts of my hair that she insisted come off. She asked if she could take some pieces in the front off since they \"don't contribute to my length\". I said \"personally I believe they do co tribute to my length and I cannot\" she said \"it's not that you cannot, it's that you will not. There is a difference. I don't want you to say cannot. I want you to keep an open mind\". I broke down in tears because I felt like she wasn't listening to me. She said she is trying to get me to open my eyes of possibilities with my hair. I told her I JUST want long hair. THAT'S IT. \n\nI was hoping to leave her salon with my hair full and voluminous like I get it at home, but she left my hair 70 % dry because she ran out of time. She made a remark before she defused it that since I didn't care about volume it didn't matter about certain things that she would normally do. I said \"that is not true I really care about volume you should see it when I do it at home\" and she was kind of just passive agressive because I didn't want layers. \n\nI left with a good haircut since she has a massive reputation to uphold, but I left feeling bad about myself for wanting long one length hair? I just want long disney princess hair... that would heal my inner child who had an ear length bob against my will. I just want to feel pretty, and layers would set back 3 years of growth. Why couldn't she respect me? ",
