      "content": "\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm Suyog, 34 years old. I wanted to share my 5-month update after finally taking the plunge for a hair transplant earlier this year.\n\nBefore going ahead, I had actually consulted one of the top clinics in India ‚Äî the kind everyone recommends when you search online. But somehow, I wasn‚Äôt convinced with the cookie-cutter approach they suggested. My baldness had been stable for quite some time, and I wanted something customized and artistic, not just a generic dense-pack.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I came across some really honest and detailed discussions here on Reddit‚Äôs Hair Transplant community. Reading through patient feedback and doctor reviews gave me the confidence to look beyond the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù names and focus on skill, design sense, and ethics.\n\nLong story short ‚Äî I found a surgeon in Patna who completely understood what I wanted: a natural, 3-peaked frontal hairline with temporal point enhancement that would suit my face and age.\n\nüå± The Journey So Far\n\nIt‚Äôs been 5 months since the procedure, and I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm at about 60% growth right now. The remaining 40% should fill in over the next few months. Even at this stage, the hairline looks super natural, and the temporal points blend beautifully ‚Äî exactly what I hoped for.\n\nI‚Äôm honestly thrilled with the outcome so far, especially knowing this is just the partial result.\n\nüôè A Note of Gratitude\n\nA big shout-out to this Reddit community ‚Äî without your posts, before-after pictures, and candid feedback, I might have gone for marketing hype instead of real artistry. You guys unknowingly guided me toward the right hands.\n\nWill post my full 8‚Äì12 month update later with detailed pictures once the growth completes.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything about my experience ‚Äî happy to give back to the same community that helped me so much!\n\n",

I‚Äôve also bleached and dyed my hair a few times. But tell me is my hair actually seeing some improvement or am I being delusional I really don‚Äôt know to trust my judgment bc I asked my sister and she isn‚Äôt entirely convinced about any of my hair texture and says I ‚Äúmight have wavy hair‚Äù \n\nI use Pantene sheer volume shampoo for well shampooing it and I do it twice, after that I use the shampoo sheer volume conditioner, I finger brush through my hair to get the tangled and then I use a brush to comb all the products into my hair thoroughly, once I rinse the conditioner I used a leave in conditioner called ‚Äúkinky curly knot today‚Äù and rake that through my hair, which I‚Äôm again finger combing it to get the tangled out, after basically lathering it through all hair and detangling I brush again to get it really deep in the scalp. After that I use curl gel called ‚Äúnot your mothers sculpting gel‚Äù so I rake it in alll over, after coating all the layers through, I shake my head a little, I lift my my hair up a few times and then I start to scrunch, now for drying I plopped my hair by tying it a t-shirt, and then waited for 20 minutes, after that I micro plop for 15 or so minutes but I‚Äôm thinking of doing it for less time and after micro plopping I just diffused it in a specific\n\n\nNow as for the routine I did a few nights ago I only changed up my diffusing a tad, didn‚Äôt plop or microplop and just diffused. Also I will admit I do not have heat protectant spray but I don‚Äôt diffuse all that often tbh. I also finger coiled my hair in sections that night but idk how well it works with wavy hair (or possibly even loose curly hair? Idk)  my hair is thick with fine strands.\n\n\nDoes my hair even have a possibility of getting curlier? Any and all constructive criticism is allowed and encouraged Im still a beginner to this all ",

I'm fairly a lower middle class guy who's recently dived into skincare routine. And being learning how to use the products affectively at low cost.\n\nMy current product stack :\n- Pond's Super Light gel\n- Joy Hello Sun Tinted Sunscreen \n- DermaTouch Salicylic 2% facewash \n- Minimalist 9% AHA + 1% BHA serum\n- Tretin 0.05%\n\nI moisturize the moment I come out of bath. Slap sunscreen twice (once at morning, again after lunch). Tretinoin every alternate night. \n\nWhere I did a mistake, was to misjudge the frequency of cleansing and exfoliating. I used to pretty much cleanse at the morning before first sunscreen application, then at noon before 2nd application, then again at night before the active. It was freaking 2% salicylic acid, so most of the times I suffered from the dryness &amp; oilyness rebound cycles throughout the days, weeks &amp; months. 3 times a day ! My routine itself was the culprit for what I thought of fixing it. And then the serum twice every week. It was already a lot of barrier damage, triggering red acne bumps, flaky skin &amp; oil rebounds.\n\nTHE FIX :\n\nI've now toned down my cleanser usage to just at night. Being only water rinsing at daytime when I get oily from sunscreen application. Reduced serum to only once a week. And started applying moisturizer only when I feel my skin is about to get dry.\n\nThe results were fantastic ! With the same product stack, all of my acne vanished. The barrier isn't inflamed anymore. And it's thickened a lot, with less open pores.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR : Reduced cleanser frequency to just once everyday and my obsession with over cleansing habit. And fixed my flaky inflamed red skin with red acne bumps.",

I don't have an income so I get what I can. I only air dry, I don't have a diffuser. just a dryer with no attachments. if I gel I will put it up in a cheap bonnet for 10-15 so I'm not dripping water everywhere. I used to cowash but I can't anymore, my hair is way too greasy!\n\nmy hair is very greasy and when I gel, it's a grease bomb the next day. sometimes when I gel, it either looks nice or doesn't do much. I also seem to completely miss the back of my hair when I make extra sure I get gel back there... I wonder if I'm doing it wrong or if my bonnet is absorbing it? \n\nI also have autism and the feel of gel in my hair makes my skin crawl. so I don't usually gel. \n\nis there anything I can try doing different? my budget is insanely tight so I can't spend more than $15-$20 on products. \n\nthanks in advance.",

I'm unsure what type it is, but it's very fine, wavy/curly, frizzy. My guess is somewhere in between 2a, 2b, and 3a. This is the aftermath of me actually making an effort to do something with it.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n‚Ä¢ DesignMe shampoo and conditioner (clarifying shampoo once a week, sometimes biweekly. I also like to switch up the conditioner sometimes from my curly one to a moisture specific one. Same brand.)\n\n‚Ä¢ Loma leave in conditioner \n\n‚Ä¢ DesignMe curl cream with lots of scrunching on damp hair\n\n‚Ä¢ Diffuse on low-med and 'bounce' the hair gently as I dry and continue to scrunch as needed. \n\nIt starts to fall out and lose the more defined curl/wave after like maybe 20min (as seen in pic 3 and 4). The top and sides are doing what they're supposed to, but the back and bottom layer is fluffy and dry and straight in comparison. \nSomeone please give me tips on making it stay the way I make it. It looks so stringy to me üò≠ ",
