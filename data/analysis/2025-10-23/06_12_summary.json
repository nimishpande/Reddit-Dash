      "content": "I've seen tallow everywhere lately and it's driving me absolutely insane. I've been struggling with skincare for years, fell for more than one \"miracle cures\" now I can smell this BS from a mile away.\n\nThe amount of sponsored content I'm seeing on Insta and TikTok about beef tallow being some magic skincare ingredient is disturbing. These influencers are literally getting paid to lie through their teeth about how \"life-changing\" rubbing cow fat on their face has been. It's so obvious that big animal agriculture is trying to create a new market for their waste products by marketing to vulnerable people desperate to clear their skin up.\n\nNot to mention with RFK now saying stupid dumb stuff like \"make tallow great again\", i've had enough.\n\nWhat really gets me is how they frame it as this \"natural, ancestral\" solution while completely ignoring that there are plant-based alternatives that work just as well¬†*if not better*¬†without supporting an industry that's destroying our planet. Shea butter, coconut oil, jojoba oil all amazing for skin and none of them require animal suffering.\n\nI've been down the rabbit hole of researching this and it's basically just another way for the meat industry to monetize every single part of the animal. They create the waste, then convince people it's a premium skincare ingredient. It's honestly genius marketing but absolutely disgusting ethics.",

      "content": "\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm Suyog, 34 years old. I wanted to share my 5-month update after finally taking the plunge for a hair transplant earlier this year.\n\nBefore going ahead, I had actually consulted one of the top clinics in India ‚Äî the kind everyone recommends when you search online. But somehow, I wasn‚Äôt convinced with the cookie-cutter approach they suggested. My baldness had been stable for quite some time, and I wanted something customized and artistic, not just a generic dense-pack.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I came across some really honest and detailed discussions here on Reddit‚Äôs Hair Transplant community. Reading through patient feedback and doctor reviews gave me the confidence to look beyond the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù names and focus on skill, design sense, and ethics.\n\nLong story short ‚Äî I found a surgeon in Patna who completely understood what I wanted: a natural, 3-peaked frontal hairline with temporal point enhancement that would suit my face and age.\n\nüå± The Journey So Far\n\nIt‚Äôs been 5 months since the procedure, and I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm at about 60% growth right now. The remaining 40% should fill in over the next few months. Even at this stage, the hairline looks super natural, and the temporal points blend beautifully ‚Äî exactly what I hoped for.\n\nI‚Äôm honestly thrilled with the outcome so far, especially knowing this is just the partial result.\n\nüôè A Note of Gratitude\n\nA big shout-out to this Reddit community ‚Äî without your posts, before-after pictures, and candid feedback, I might have gone for marketing hype instead of real artistry. You guys unknowingly guided me toward the right hands.\n\nWill post my full 8‚Äì12 month update later with detailed pictures once the growth completes.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything about my experience ‚Äî happy to give back to the same community that helped me so much!\n\n",

      "content": "I have a curly cut coming up late November and I‚Äôm so excited! I usually get my hair cut for straight hair since I most often style it blown out. But I‚Äôve been diligently growing my hair out with the hopes of finally embracing the curls again (I prefer long curls on me)!\n\nMy one non-negotiable is keeping the length, no trim necessary quite yet. At this point when the curls are happy it looks good, I think I only need a little shaping, face framing, some curly curtain bangs and some layering around the cheek to eye level. What do you think would look best on me? I believe my head shape to be square-square/oval and feel a bit insecure about a fuller jaw area, so I feel that bringing more attention higher on my head will help with that? I do really like curly shags, especially more wolf cut less mullet for myself :) I love feminine, ethereal, natural, lived in vibes!\n\nThis routine was pretty simple, I washed with Garnier Whole Blends Honey Treasures shampoo and Camille Rose Guava Slip conditioner. I dried with a T-shirt then applied Ouai hair oil, finger coiled front an some other top pieces and diffused mostly dry, then air dried the rest of the way.",

I have struggled with acne all my life, however in the last few years, my face has mostly redeemed all over, and I have these small red dots everywhere. I am looking for ANY and ALL advice!! Skincare product and routine recommendations, questions, random tips, even just helping me to figure out WHAT is wrong!!!\n\nThe red dots are not bumpy and they do not hurt. They are completely smooth all-over, and they don‚Äôt develop into acne (although I do GET real acne, but not nearly as much as I used to). They are just persistently *there* all over my cheeks and jawline. They don‚Äôt extend to the middle of my face, nose, or forehead (although those areas are still just a bit red in general).\n\nMy skin is combination, it is super oily along the T-zone (and also my cheeks) but my jawline extending into my cheeks, can be dry or regular. My skin is highly sensitive, and I believe I might have a damaged skin barrier??\n\nMy current skincare routine (all from The Ordinary) are:\n\nMORNING:\n- Cream cleanser\n- Milky toner\n- Cream moisturiser (first moisturiser that doesn‚Äôt make me break out)\n- Sunscreen (different brand, Australian)\n- LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING GOOD, BUT LOOKING VERY RED COMPARED TO WHEN I WOKE UP\n\nEVENING:\n- oil-to-balm makeup remover (Australian brand again)\n- oil-to-balm cleanser\n- salicylic acid serum\n- Cream moisturiser (stings when I use after the acid)\n\nI wear a lot of makeup, but these skin issues started well before that. Im only wearing makeup to cover the skin issues up. I am willing to buy more heavy duty serums, toners, whatever I need.",

Same brand.)\n\n‚Ä¢ Loma leave in conditioner \n\n‚Ä¢ DesignMe curl cream with lots of scrunching on damp hair\n\n‚Ä¢ Diffuse on low-med and 'bounce' the hair gently as I dry and continue to scrunch as needed. \n\nIt starts to fall out and lose the more defined curl/wave after like maybe 20min (as seen in pic 3 and 4). The top and sides are doing what they're supposed to, but the back and bottom layer is fluffy and dry and straight in comparison. \nSomeone please give me tips on making it stay the way I make it. It looks so stringy to me üò≠ ",

      "title": "Found out my routine was weighing my (super) fine hair down, but not sure what and how to change it",
      "content": "Hi! I am currently SO lost in my hair care routine and would deeply appreciate any advice. Firstly, I think my hair is between a 2c and 3a, because my hair definitely isn't wavy but isn't as curly as some of the 3a photos I've seen. My hair is also ULTRA fine, and I realized I've been weighing it down w/ my old routine. Please don't judge the amount of products, I was trying all the things recommended to me in hopes that something would work out... \n\nFor more context, I wash my hair every 3rd day. I spent many years insisting my was straight and using straight hair products (it was a bird's nest but at least the curls were all brushed out right? /s). I've always thought my roots were VERY oily, but once I spaced out washes and started using shampoos for curly hair, it helped tremendously. Additionally, the very beginning of my roots are straight, so the hair starts to curl 1-2 fingers away (unless it is being weighed down). Now, my roots aren't dry but they aren't as oily -- they only start to get oily at the end of the 3rd day. \n\nPRODUCTS (and how I used them): \n\n* L√≥real Metal Detox shampoo (1x/month)\n* Aveda Be Curly Advanced shampoo, conditioner, curl enhancer cream, and gel. Plus the mask (substituting the conditioner) every once in a while. Here's how I use them: \n   * Shampoo twice, then conditioner paired with the Tangle Teezer Ultimate Detangler brush. After detangling, I pin my hair up while I wash my body etc, and later take out the clip to wash it off\n   * Right after I turn off the faucet, without squeezing any water out of my hair, I split it in half. Then, I split it in between the hair in front of and behind my ears. I pin the front part and brush the curl enhancer cream with my fingers on the back half. After that, I use the Bounce Curl Volume Edgelift brush and scrunch\n   * Repeat on the front part, and then apply gel and scrunch with my head down. Then I scrunch it a bit with a DevaCurl hair towel and then put it on my head\n* Styling mousse I bought in my area. I use it after I take off the hair towel and scrunch\n* Heat protecting, volumizing spray (used to be OUAI thickening spray but I started using the Olaplex volumizing blow dry mist)\n* Diffuse\n* Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Smooth Shine oil to break the cast afterwards\n\nAs you can probably imagine, all of this weighed down my hair. I had curl definition, but my roots seemed glued to my head. The curls would start to 'die' (can't find a better word) from the root down. Frustrated, I even bought a bunch of drugstore hair clips to try creating volume (after diffusing). I looked insane, and I was willing to keep doing that if it worked. It kinda worked, but only for a few hours.\n\nI gave up and decided my hair did not, and would not, ever have volume. Fast forward to one night when I started feeling off after I got out of the shower: I decided I would style it in the morning. The next day, when I took my hair out of the bonnet, it *magically* had volume I hadn't seen in ages. Plus, my curls were still pretty defined on their own (not as defined as they can get, but still pretty good). I did this a couple times, and it worked. Still, some of my curls weren't looking as good, specially my bangs (I have a curly cut w/ curtain bangs).\n\nYesterday, I tried washing my hair as normal, scrunching out the water, and then using a towel I got at the curly hair salon to scrunch and put up my hair to dry. After a bit, I put my hair down, used a water spray to get my hair soaking wet again (except the roots -- as suggested by a stylist). Then I split my hair into top &amp; bottom to try to give the roots and bangs 'special attention.' I used the *tiniest* amount of curl cream, the Bounce Curl brush, and another tiny amount of gel on all my hair. I then put it up to dry a bit with a 100% organic cotton t-shirt. Afterwards, to diffuse, I sprayed the smallest amount of the Olaplex spray I could use while still feeling confident about the heat protection. My hair looked good, but the next morning it still looked like it was weighed down (not as much as before though). The ends (&amp; most of the middle) of my hair had pretty defined curls, but some of the top and most of the front of my hair (specially my bangs) looked lifeless and limp, with my curls 'dying' (I hope this makes sense lol) starting from the top of my hair. \n\nSome more info that I'm not sure is relevant: sometimes my hair looks curlier and w/ more volume right after being twisted up in a bun for a while, and I don't understand why.\n\n",

I'm fairly a lower middle class guy who's recently dived into skincare routine. And being learning how to use the products affectively at low cost.\n\nMy current product stack :\n- Pond's Super Light gel\n- Joy Hello Sun Tinted Sunscreen \n- DermaTouch Salicylic 2% facewash \n- Minimalist 9% AHA + 1% BHA serum\n- Tretin 0.05%\n\nI moisturize the moment I come out of bath. Slap sunscreen twice (once at morning, again after lunch). Tretinoin every alternate night. \n\nWhere I did a mistake, was to misjudge the frequency of cleansing and exfoliating. I used to pretty much cleanse at the morning before first sunscreen application, then at noon before 2nd application, then again at night before the active. It was freaking 2% salicylic acid, so most of the times I suffered from the dryness &amp; oilyness rebound cycles throughout the days, weeks &amp; months. 3 times a day ! My routine itself was the culprit for what I thought of fixing it. And then the serum twice every week. It was already a lot of barrier damage, triggering red acne bumps, flaky skin &amp; oil rebounds.\n\nTHE FIX :\n\nI've now toned down my cleanser usage to just at night. Being only water rinsing at daytime when I get oily from sunscreen application. Reduced serum to only once a week. And started applying moisturizer only when I feel my skin is about to get dry.\n\nThe results were fantastic ! With the same product stack, all of my acne vanished.

      "title": "I have CURLY hair. No I do NOT want layers. Anyone relate to my story?",
      "content": "\nI spent my entire life with all sorts of layers, haircuts, colors. I started dying and cutting my hair all sorts of ways starting at 13. I am 26 now. I was always jealous of girls with flowing, luscious long hair who didn't have to think about how they were going to get their weird layers to lay correctly. I decided to do a big chop 3 years ago to get rid of any last fried bleached hair so I could finally start growing it out to be the long princess hair that I was always jealous of. I was getting haircuts every few months but every hair dresser I went to would not do what I asked even remotely. It started getting so frustrating that I stopped going 2 years ago. For the last year I have just been letting my hair grow and I am only about 1 year away from my length goal that I have dreamed of my whole life. I even spent thousands on extentions when I was 18 to have this length, but they never matched my texture and I gave up on that. \n\nEven though I haven't use any heat at all in one year, unfortunately  I have a lot of split ends from not caring for my hair in ways that I was ignorant of like hard water and the type of brush I was using. I realized if I don't get them cut I will end up losing way more hair than I want to. I did 2 months of research before I finally found a curly hair specialist. I was extremely excited for her to help my hair. I told her I only want 1 inch off, no layers and to fix my bangs and face framing pieces that I have been cutting myself. She asked me multiple times why I was wanting her to do my hair that she specializes in curly cuts and I am not wanting a curly cut. I said because she understands curly hair and she would cut my hair correctly. She said she doesn't understand why I wouldn't go to a cheaper hair dresser who isn't known for curly cuts. She said that unless I want layers she would not be cutting my hair how she recommends. I said I am growing my hair and I refuse to have layers. She asked if i ever had layers before. I said most of my life. She said \"well you haven't had my layers\" . I said I don't care if layers make my hair more curly, I just want long hair with healthy curls coming out. She kept pointing to all the parts of my hair that she insisted come off. She asked if she could take some pieces in the front off since they \"don't contribute to my length\". I said \"personally I believe they do co tribute to my length and I cannot\" she said \"it's not that you cannot, it's that you will not. There is a difference. I don't want you to say cannot. I want you to keep an open mind\". I broke down in tears because I felt like she wasn't listening to me. She said she is trying to get me to open my eyes of possibilities with my hair. I told her I JUST want long hair. THAT'S IT. \n\nI was hoping to leave her salon with my hair full and voluminous like I get it at home, but she left my hair 70 % dry because she ran out of time. She made a remark before she defused it that since I didn't care about volume it didn't matter about certain things that she would normally do. I said \"that is not true I really care about volume you should see it when I do it at home\" and she was kind of just passive agressive because I didn't want layers. \n\nI left with a good haircut since she has a massive reputation to uphold, but I left feeling bad about myself for wanting long one length hair? I just want long disney princess hair... that would heal my inner child who had an ear length bob against my will. I just want to feel pretty, and layers would set back 3 years of growth. Why couldn't she respect me? ",

I was having laser removal to combat this but I‚Äôm currently 38 weeks pregnant so this hasn‚Äôt been an option for me.\n\nWhen I got pregnant my doctor recommended switching to a natural deodorant. I went for wild. There was an adjustment period but it started working quite well.\n\nAnyway to cut a long story short, ever since starting the natural deodorant I‚Äôve suffered with lumps forming in my armpits about every 2 weeks. They‚Äôre hard and firm and resolve on their own. My doctor is stumped and prescribed some antibacterial wash to use.\n\nI did my own googling and found that a few people report similar problems when using natural deodorant. Has anyone else experienced this? I‚Äôm wondering if there are other brands I should try or even if I should go back to high street brands.\n\nThanks so much if you read my ramble!!

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm exploring an idea for a new kind of **skincare shopping platform** and I‚Äôd love some honest feedback from this community.\n\nI feel like skincare shopping online today is mostly guesswork ‚Äî we rely on ads, influencers, or random reviews, and half the time the product doesn‚Äôt suit our skin type.\n\nSo here‚Äôs the idea I‚Äôm testing:\n\n**1Ô∏è‚É£ Try free samples before you buy.**  \nWhen you place an order, you can choose a few skincare samples (from verified brands) to try for free. If something works for you, you can come back and buy the full size confidently.\n\n**2Ô∏è‚É£ Only verified, expert-reviewed products.**  \nEvery product we list is reviewed by qualified skincare experts ‚Äî not influencers. You‚Äôll know exactly what‚Äôs in it, how it works, and who it‚Äôs best suited for. As a consumer you could see a short video of expert sharing opinion.\n\nMy goal is to make online skincare shopping feel **safe, trustworthy, and personalized** ‚Äî instead of hit or miss.\n\nI‚Äôm not launching yet, just validating whether this actually solves a real problem for skincare buyers.\n\nI‚Äôd love your help:  \nüí¨ Would you use something like this?\n\n  \nReally appreciate your honest thoughts ‚Äî brutal or positive, all welcome üôè",

I rarely have acne on my face anymore ‚Äì I have taken care of it with a simple CeraVe routine. It seems like I‚Äôve had the stomach acne forever though.
