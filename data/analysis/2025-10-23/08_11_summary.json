      "content": "I've seen tallow everywhere lately and it's driving me absolutely insane. I've been struggling with skincare for years, fell for more than one \"miracle cures\" now I can smell this BS from a mile away.\n\nThe amount of sponsored content I'm seeing on Insta and TikTok about beef tallow being some magic skincare ingredient is disturbing. These influencers are literally getting paid to lie through their teeth about how \"life-changing\" rubbing cow fat on their face has been. It's so obvious that big animal agriculture is trying to create a new market for their waste products by marketing to vulnerable people desperate to clear their skin up.\n\nNot to mention with RFK now saying stupid dumb stuff like \"make tallow great again\", i've had enough.\n\nWhat really gets me is how they frame it as this \"natural, ancestral\" solution while completely ignoring that there are plant-based alternatives that work just as well¬†*if not better*¬†without supporting an industry that's destroying our planet. Shea butter, coconut oil, jojoba oil all amazing for skin and none of them require animal suffering.\n\nI've been down the rabbit hole of researching this and it's basically just another way for the meat industry to monetize every single part of the animal. They create the waste, then convince people it's a premium skincare ingredient. It's honestly genius marketing but absolutely disgusting ethics.",

      "content": "\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm Suyog, 34 years old. I wanted to share my 5-month update after finally taking the plunge for a hair transplant earlier this year.\n\nBefore going ahead, I had actually consulted one of the top clinics in India ‚Äî the kind everyone recommends when you search online. But somehow, I wasn‚Äôt convinced with the cookie-cutter approach they suggested. My baldness had been stable for quite some time, and I wanted something customized and artistic, not just a generic dense-pack.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I came across some really honest and detailed discussions here on Reddit‚Äôs Hair Transplant community. Reading through patient feedback and doctor reviews gave me the confidence to look beyond the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù names and focus on skill, design sense, and ethics.\n\nLong story short ‚Äî I found a surgeon in Patna who completely understood what I wanted: a natural, 3-peaked frontal hairline with temporal point enhancement that would suit my face and age.\n\nüå± The Journey So Far\n\nIt‚Äôs been 5 months since the procedure, and I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm at about 60% growth right now. The remaining 40% should fill in over the next few months. Even at this stage, the hairline looks super natural, and the temporal points blend beautifully ‚Äî exactly what I hoped for.\n\nI‚Äôm honestly thrilled with the outcome so far, especially knowing this is just the partial result.\n\nüôè A Note of Gratitude\n\nA big shout-out to this Reddit community ‚Äî without your posts, before-after pictures, and candid feedback, I might have gone for marketing hype instead of real artistry. You guys unknowingly guided me toward the right hands.\n\nWill post my full 8‚Äì12 month update later with detailed pictures once the growth completes.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything about my experience ‚Äî happy to give back to the same community that helped me so much!\n\n",

      "content": "I have a curly cut coming up late November and I‚Äôm so excited! I usually get my hair cut for straight hair since I most often style it blown out. But I‚Äôve been diligently growing my hair out with the hopes of finally embracing the curls again (I prefer long curls on me)!\n\nMy one non-negotiable is keeping the length, no trim necessary quite yet. At this point when the curls are happy it looks good, I think I only need a little shaping, face framing, some curly curtain bangs and some layering around the cheek to eye level. What do you think would look best on me? I believe my head shape to be square-square/oval and feel a bit insecure about a fuller jaw area, so I feel that bringing more attention higher on my head will help with that? I do really like curly shags, especially more wolf cut less mullet for myself :) I love feminine, ethereal, natural, lived in vibes!\n\nThis routine was pretty simple, I washed with Garnier Whole Blends Honey Treasures shampoo and Camille Rose Guava Slip conditioner. I dried with a T-shirt then applied Ouai hair oil, finger coiled front an some other top pieces and diffused mostly dry, then air dried the rest of the way.",

I have struggled with acne all my life, however in the last few years, my face has mostly redeemed all over, and I have these small red dots everywhere. I am looking for ANY and ALL advice!! Skincare product and routine recommendations, questions, random tips, even just helping me to figure out WHAT is wrong!!!\n\nThe red dots are not bumpy and they do not hurt. They are completely smooth all-over, and they don‚Äôt develop into acne (although I do GET real acne, but not nearly as much as I used to). They are just persistently *there* all over my cheeks and jawline. They don‚Äôt extend to the middle of my face, nose, or forehead (although those areas are still just a bit red in general).\n\nMy skin is combination, it is super oily along the T-zone (and also my cheeks) but my jawline extending into my cheeks, can be dry or regular. My skin is highly sensitive, and I believe I might have a damaged skin barrier??\n\nMy current skincare routine (all from The Ordinary) are:\n\nMORNING:\n- Cream cleanser\n- Milky toner\n- Cream moisturiser (first moisturiser that doesn‚Äôt make me break out)\n- Sunscreen (different brand, Australian)\n- LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING GOOD, BUT LOOKING VERY RED COMPARED TO WHEN I WOKE UP\n\nEVENING:\n- oil-to-balm makeup remover (Australian brand again)\n- oil-to-balm cleanser\n- salicylic acid serum\n- Cream moisturiser (stings when I use after the acid)\n\nI wear a lot of makeup, but these skin issues started well before that. Im only wearing makeup to cover the skin issues up. I am willing to buy more heavy duty serums, toners, whatever I need.",

I'm fairly a lower middle class guy who's recently dived into skincare routine. And being learning how to use the products affectively at low cost.\n\nMy current product stack :\n- Pond's Super Light gel\n- Joy Hello Sun Tinted Sunscreen \n- DermaTouch Salicylic 2% facewash \n- Minimalist 9% AHA + 1% BHA serum\n- Tretin 0.05%\n\nI moisturize the moment I come out of bath. Slap sunscreen twice (once at morning, again after lunch). Tretinoin every alternate night. \n\nWhere I did a mistake, was to misjudge the frequency of cleansing and exfoliating. I used to pretty much cleanse at the morning before first sunscreen application, then at noon before 2nd application, then again at night before the active. It was freaking 2% salicylic acid, so most of the times I suffered from the dryness &amp; oilyness rebound cycles throughout the days, weeks &amp; months. 3 times a day ! My routine itself was the culprit for what I thought of fixing it. And then the serum twice every week. It was already a lot of barrier damage, triggering red acne bumps, flaky skin &amp; oil rebounds.\n\nTHE FIX :\n\nI've now toned down my cleanser usage to just at night. Being only water rinsing at daytime when I get oily from sunscreen application. Reduced serum to only once a week. And started applying moisturizer only when I feel my skin is about to get dry.\n\nThe results were fantastic ! With the same product stack, all of my acne vanished. The barrier isn't inflamed anymore. And it's thickened a lot, with less open pores.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR : Reduced cleanser frequency to just once everyday and my obsession with over cleansing habit. And fixed my flaky inflamed red skin with red acne bumps.",

      "title": "Found out my routine was weighing my (super) fine hair down, but not sure what and how to change it",
      "content": "Hi! I am currently SO lost in my hair care routine and would deeply appreciate any advice. Firstly, I think my hair is between a 2c and 3a, because my hair definitely isn't wavy but isn't as curly as some of the 3a photos I've seen. My hair is also ULTRA fine, and I realized I've been weighing it down w/ my old routine. Please don't judge the amount of products, I was trying all the things recommended to me in hopes that something would work out... \n\nFor more context, I wash my hair every 3rd day. I spent many years insisting my was straight and using straight hair products (it was a bird's nest but at least the curls were all brushed out right? /s). I've always thought my roots were VERY oily, but once I spaced out washes and started using shampoos for curly hair, it helped tremendously. Additionally, the very beginning of my roots are straight, so the hair starts to curl 1-2 fingers away (unless it is being weighed down). Now, my roots aren't dry but they aren't as oily -- they only start to get oily at the end of the 3rd day. \n\nPRODUCTS (and how I used them): \n\n* L√≥real Metal Detox shampoo (1x/month)\n* Aveda Be Curly Advanced shampoo, conditioner, curl enhancer cream, and gel. Plus the mask (substituting the conditioner) every once in a while. Here's how I use them: \n   * Shampoo twice, then conditioner paired with the Tangle Teezer Ultimate Detangler brush. After detangling, I pin my hair up while I wash my body etc, and later take out the clip to wash it off\n   * Right after I turn off the faucet, without squeezing any water out of my hair, I split it in half. Then, I split it in between the hair in front of and behind my ears. I pin the front part and brush the curl enhancer cream with my fingers on the back half. After that, I use the Bounce Curl Volume Edgelift brush and scrunch\n   * Repeat on the front part, and then apply gel and scrunch with my head down. Then I scrunch it a bit with a DevaCurl hair towel and then put it on my head\n* Styling mousse I bought in my area. I use it after I take off the hair towel and scrunch\n* Heat protecting, volumizing spray (used to be OUAI thickening spray but I started using the Olaplex volumizing blow dry mist)\n* Diffuse\n* Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Smooth Shine oil to break the cast afterwards\n\nAs you can probably imagine, all of this weighed down my hair. I had curl definition, but my roots seemed glued to my head. The curls would start to 'die' (can't find a better word) from the root down. Frustrated, I even bought a bunch of drugstore hair clips to try creating volume (after diffusing). I looked insane, and I was willing to keep doing that if it worked. It kinda worked, but only for a few hours.\n\nI gave up and decided my hair did not, and would not, ever have volume. Fast forward to one night when I started feeling off after I got out of the shower: I decided I would style it in the morning. The next day, when I took my hair out of the bonnet, it *magically* had volume I hadn't seen in ages. Plus, my curls were still pretty defined on their own (not as defined as they can get, but still pretty good). I did this a couple times, and it worked. Still, some of my curls weren't looking as good, specially my bangs (I have a curly cut w/ curtain bangs).\n\nYesterday, I tried washing my hair as normal, scrunching out the water, and then using a towel I got at the curly hair salon to scrunch and put up my hair to dry. After a bit, I put my hair down, used a water spray to get my hair soaking wet again (except the roots -- as suggested by a stylist). Then I split my hair into top &amp; bottom to try to give the roots and bangs 'special attention.' I used the *tiniest* amount of curl cream, the Bounce Curl brush, and another tiny amount of gel on all my hair. I then put it up to dry a bit with a 100% organic cotton t-shirt. Afterwards, to diffuse, I sprayed the smallest amount of the Olaplex spray I could use while still feeling confident about the heat protection. My hair looked good, but the next morning it still looked like it was weighed down (not as much as before though). The ends (&amp; most of the middle) of my hair had pretty defined curls, but some of the top and most of the front of my hair (specially my bangs) looked lifeless and limp, with my curls 'dying' (I hope this makes sense lol) starting from the top of my hair. \n\nSome more info that I'm not sure is relevant: sometimes my hair looks curlier and w/ more volume right after being twisted up in a bun for a while, and I don't understand why.\n\n",
