I wash my hair every other day with the following routine:\n\n1. Shampoo: Head and Shoulders\n2. Conditioner: A small amount of Maui Moisture's lightweight curls + flaxseed conditioner (only around 75% of the time, otherwise it starts to feel over-moisturized)\n3. Scrunch upside down with a towel and then air dry\n\nI'd like to start trying more products/a better routine, but it's been demoralizing to try that in the past and end up with mushy hair that's somehow even more frizzy and less curly than it is right now. I think it's also kind of a weird shape because I'm growing out a mullet, and the way my hair forms these spiral clumps when it gets long enough makes the cut look even more unbalanced. I want to love my hair - and I do, sometimes - but lately it just feels like it looks awful.\n\nI don't even know exactly what I'm looking for from this post. Maybe just insight or advice from other people who have dealt with similar issues? Or who have similar hair types? Thanks all &lt;3",

I want to add that I’ve avoided posting because I know you guys are about to fry me lol.\n\nI’ll admit I was very fortunate and uneducated in my youth and early adulthood - I could put whatever on her and she flourished.  Her best look was when I was using healthy sexy hairs tri wheat leave in and garniers spray gel. Then one day I thought I should start using actual curly products and it all kinda went to hell from there, slowly but surely. \n\nCurrent routine is:\n\n\\- wash every 2 days with redKen all soft \n\n\\- oribes hair alchemy fortifying treatment for leave in \n\n\\- I’ve tried numerous gels and mousses but the current one I’ve had luck with is miss Jessie’s pillow talk lotion which I comb throughout my hair then scrunch with a t shirt \n\n\\- air dry \n\nYou read all that correctly - I use no masks, have no protein (I just learned this is a big necessity which is wild), etc, no clarifying shampoo, etc.\n\nI’d like to also note I HAVE to wash every 2 days. I have tried and tried to prolong it with a bonnet, wrap, satin pillowcase, etc and my hair wads up and gets oily. Any tips for that is great too! When I do refresh, I use a tiny bit of oribe oil on the tips to give some hydration back to them. \n\nBack when my hair looked its best, I’d like to note how that looked: \n\n\\- wash every day with tresemme moisture shampoo and conditioner\n\n\\- towel dry, and when damp, use healthy sexy hairs tri wheat soy leave in and then brush out with a wet brush (still use this) \n\n\\- garnier spray gel, sprayed throughout then scrunch with hands \n\n\\- air dry \n\nIf you are wondering why I strayed from this - my hair began feeling dry and curling weird, so I swapped things out until my hair was soft again but at the cost of my curls it seems\n\nI’m here because she has really stopped forming full curls around my face and at my root/crown. All of my ringlets start at collarbone level and go to my ends. They also have started tangling together and wadding up (I hope that makes sense.) I’ve began wearing my hair up in a clip to avoid this and i actually have an appointment to cut it to shoulder length again tomorrow (it’s currently a little longer than mid back.) \n\nSo my question is what do I do? What do you recommend? When I began searching, I found a million answers to what I COULD do, but then determined the best route was to actually show you guys my hair and embarrassingly admit that I don’t do much. I need products, a routine, all the things. Is cutting it going to be good for it? I know it’s heavy and weight can impact how it curls up top. Anyway - sos send help and thanks in advance 😭",

I have like 2b-2c hair and it’s almost to my waist but the inner bit (underneath like next to my neck) is always so frizzy and almost straight but the outside bits are really curly in comparison. I would really appreciate it if someone could possibly help me come up with a curly hair routine with some product recommendations and what I might be doing wrong.\n\nOh and also I have a hair drying with a diffuser end but I have no clue how to use it. And it’s like almost near my waist so I know it’s probably being weighed down but I would really not like to cut it off.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciate!!\n\nMy current routine is:  \n\\-Shower (elvive nourishing shampoo and conditioner) and I leave in conditioner for a while before detangling and washing out  \n\\-Use the John Freida mousse using prayer hands and then scrunch in after.  \n\\-Then I use the Eco style argon oil gel and scrunch it in (I don’t put my head upside down by the way. I don’t know if that help) and it just kind of stays curly for a few seconds like 30 seconds and then falls. I make sure my hairs wet whilst doing this.  \n\\-Then I use a cotton t-shirt to microplop and then I have to go to sleep so I put on a silk bonnet and hope for the best. I don’t have time to do it in the morning and stuff soooo…",

My main questions are what is a good routine for my hair (in general and to prevent frizz) and how do I maintain it after shampoo days. \n\nFirst 2 pics were taken second day after shampoo. If anything, this is the least frizzy my hair gets. 3rd pic is an average day of frizz. My current hair stats are 2b/2c hair on top and 2c hair on the back (at least I think). Low Porosity all around. Thick to Medium Hair.  I have a satin pillowcase. shower at night. Use a widetooth comb. I like to air dry. Haven't had a hair cut since May 2025 which was a buzz. \n\nCurrent Wash routine (every 3 days):  \n\\-Necessaire Shampoo Hyaluronic Acid. I double shampoo.  \n\\-herbal essence argan oil conditioner  \n\\-Sheamoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Conditioner Treatment (Only use it on wash days. Don't really know what it does or if its even necessary)  \n\\- (Once a week) loreal bond repair pre shampoo. Been using it for a month but don't really know if its working.  \n\n\nIn between Washes:  \nIn the morning to detangle and style I only use Pantene 10 in 1 Miracle Rescue.  \nI don't do anything else. I dont even wet my hair till next wash. \n\nLike I said, I genuinely don't know what I'm doing but I'm here to learn. Some people have told me to get a curl gel and mousse combo as well as a hair oil but I wanted to consult this sub before making any purchases. And I'd like some tips on how to maintain my hair between washes. Thanks",

It makes my acne flare up due to this and I want it to stop.\n\nI have tried acne patches but it doesn't really help with my obsessive picking. The clear acne patches easily fall off and I tend to still pick them because I can feel the bump. The only solution I have found to prevent me from picking/popping pimples are bandaids. I cannot feel the bump on bandaids so I do not pick them when I use a bandaid.\n\nBandaids look like something happened to me and makes people question. I don't like being asked this nor do I want people do worry about me for no reason. I also read bandaids aren't really recommended for long term use for acne. As it can make scarring worse.\n\nI am wondering if there is any particular brand that \\\\\\*feel\\\\\\* like a rough bandaid. Where it is not clear or thin where I can see/feel it either. I need to be unable to feel the bump on my face. I just need patches I can use long term that have that particular bandaid texture.\n\nI hope I make sense. I am sure there are also some obsessive compulsive pimple poppers here too and understand what I mean.",
