I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

Ill post pics of what i use and my skin and if this isnt the right spot then ill find and post elsewhere. I wash my face once a day at night before I go to bed. I use a wet towel to wash the soap off my face and to dry my face because I get water all over the place when trying to wash the product off in the sink and its really frustrating. I cant use ceraVe stuff on my face since that made me itchy and didn't help my face at all. I try to avoid super expensive things because i just cant afford them.

I was annoyed bc like I came for solutions not homework but started tracking with waterminder to prove I drink enough and turns out I average 30oz a day which is apparently nowhere close to adequate for skin health. She's recommending 80oz minimum before we discuss adding anything else to my routine.\n\nI've been hitting 70-80oz for past week and my skin already looks more plump, texture is smoothing out, that dull tired look is improving. Ofc Im still using my products but the internal hydration was clearly the missing piece\n\nI feel dumb for spending $400 when the solution was free tap water but at least I know now.

I think it looks decent in the mirror untill I take photos and realize how messy and disgusting one of the the sides are, and that it's overall really isemetrical. I also then look at it from different angles and I just think it looks nasty. I was wondering if anyone knows any hair styles that would go good or maybe even ways to style it? Even if you guys think it looks good I still don't think it suits me all that much and I'd wanna look into other styles. I don't really know what I want or how to figure out how to style and stuff, so that's why I'm asking. I know it might be a little farfetched but I don't like how flat and greasy some part of my hair look and was wondering if I could maybe cook something up that's a little curly like these photos from Pinterest. I was thinking maybe hair products like curl cream, texture powder, or maybe even a perm, but I just wanna know since I'm clueless. I'm really insecure about my hair so thanks a lot.",

I know I need it and I know losing some length will help my curls bounce up :) \n\nAfter spending all of 2025 trying this that and the other I am realizing that everything I have tried (curl creams, mousse, foam, leave -in, gel) weighs down my hair- even watered down versions of leave-in and gel in a spray bottle which was hardly any product. Did a clarifying shampoo the other day and removed all silicones and my hair feels light and bouncy like it used to. Now I know my hair doesn’t like silicones so much and everything I’ve tried has weighed it down so I’m back to where I started a year ago. Can anyone recommend silicone free styling products that are truly lightweight? The lightest of the light weight!! I’d love more definition of my waves/curls, but I do still need to detangle at night so I’m happy to refresh on day 2.\n\nHair type: low porosity, fine, low density, 2b/2c/3a waves and curls \n\nCurrent routine:\n\nOdele clarifying shampoo\n\nAussie waves shampoo (for second shampoo)\n\nMaui hibiscus conditioner (and combing through my hair wet in the shower)\n\nDrying with t shirt wrapped around my head (plopping has always made my curls weird somehow)\n\nAir dry with roots clipped up or diffusing on no heat low speed\n\nVery gentle detangle at night and morning (I must do this to avoid very stressful matting)\n\nJojoba oil on ends and lengths\n\nProtective style with satin bonnet\n\nAny advice is appreciated thank you thank you !!

Not necessarily great, not necessarily terrible, just always slightly above or below the middle line.\n\nThe title of this asks about the frizz but I'm also looking for some critiques and general advice. \n\nIs the pictured average day one as good as I can realistically ask for? \n\nIs it normal for curly hair to look pretty good from a few feet away but bad up close in the light?\n\nAre my routine's products (which I had lying around for months already, and did not find through any sort of research) too much together for my hair?\n\n  \n**ROUTINE:**\n\n\\- At night, wash hair with Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo (every two weeks substitute with QUAI Detox Shampoo), letting shampoo soak down my strands\n\n\\- Condition everything past my scalp with Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Conditioner via praying hands\n\n\\- Use wide tooth comb to gently detangle bottom to top, then squish my hair (feeble attempt at squish to condish)\n\n\\- Out of shower, keep hair wet with continuous spray bottle\n\n\\- Apply Love Ur Curls Step 3 and a liberal amount of LA Looks\n\n\\- Use Denman brush to gently brush some product through my hair, but otherwise praying hands it again and try and get it into big clumps myself\n\n\\- Scrunch hair and plop with a cotton t-shirt for 20-30 mins\n\n\\- Take it out, let it air dry into a gel cast\n\n\\- Tie up in pineapple and wear bonnet to sleep\n\n\\- No refreshing anymore, hair is left totally dry until next wash (felt like trying to refresh it always made it look greasy, stringy, and overall worse than it would if I just left it as is)\n\nI do this routine every 72 hours.\n\nAs it stands, my day one usually looks pretty good. Day two it's a coin toss between good again or barely average. Day three is almost always mediocre, though the routine, in my opinion, never gives me hair that is so bad I don't want to wear it down in public.\n\nAny critiques would be greatly appreciated.",

Something about this doesn’t sit quite right for me idk. Like surely one brand can’t work for every client. \n\nI have an appointment with an esthi and she has her own formulas that she’s made. I was kind of looking to have someone recommend things that aren’t all $100-$150 per product. That seems insane for a product I’m not even really able to read reviews on.  And a $400-600 skincare routine isn’t feasible for me. She also says if you’re her client, you have to be using her skincare and can’t use outside brands.\n\nI’d also rather have something that I don’t have to come directly to her for. Just something I can order routinely from Amazon or grab at Sephora if I run out.\n\nPeople get perfect skin with more reasonably priced things every day.

It is also a little dry in places and I get a lot of hairfall. Also my curls look really messy and unstructured after a couple of days.\n\nI just need some advice on what I can add to my routine to tackle these problems without using too many products. And also need help on identifying what's the root problem.\n\nI don't want to mess up things coz I'm satisfied with the volume, and the way my hair feels.. coz I recently tried a bonding spray which made me hair look terrible! I dont blow dry either coz I've tried many times even with cold air and it makes me look like a witch lol. So I just air dry now. I also dont brush my hair.. just use my hands.. I'm really not into using styling products either, it's too much stress and weighs my hair down and make it look greasy, just wanna nourish them from within.

      "content": "Hi everyone! I have just started exploring using products on my hair and wanted to get some tips. Before a week ago I never wore my hair down, having it in a low bun at all times of the day for YEARS, so I never really learned what to do with it. I only washed my hair every few days which is good, but I didn't even really use conditioner so I'm not sure what state my hair is in. I haven't changed my shampoo or conditioner, but have started using them properly and now added more products. \n\nI'm pretty sure I have fine hair, probably also dry, and a mix of 2c-3b. It dries extremely quickly, so I think it's low porosity? My issue is I don't think I'm getting a real gel cast. It depends on how literal the phrase \"scrunch out the crunch\" is, but I'm not getting anything really crunchy, maybe a bit stiff but nothing like hairspray crispy. This is my third wash day, previously I tried just scrunching in the gel but I think brushing it in worked better, that's the only change between the 3 days. It looks nice enough all pulled forward like the first picture, but the second picture taken 30 minutes later shows how it actually is very stringy and frizzy. It's like the pretty ringlets are hiding under a layer of thin frizz and only show themselves when I pull it all forward. \n\nI noticed the front section of my crown looked better than the rest of it and Im 90% sure I accidentally put gel in that section twice cuz I got distracted. So maybe I need more gel? But it feels like I'm using a lot and that section still didn't get actually crunchy. Maybe I add a curl cream? It also only lasts 2-3 days despite the bonnet and idk if that's the norm or not. Im gonna try to be as specific as possible with this routine so PLEASE critique literally anything you think I could do differently.\n\nNotes: I clarified with a shampoo that has sulfates a few days ago, and I know I need more layers to get volume at the roots, and I know that having longer hair just makes the curls more likely to be flat. So maybe don't comment that unless there's something more specific I'm missing! I also know that air drying isn't going to be as good as a diffuser but I am not ready for it and want to perfect what I can right now. Ty :)\n\nMy current routine: \n\nIn shower- shampoo twice with Aveda Rosemary Mint Purifying Shampoo, condition with Aveda Rosemary Mint Weightless Conditioner, brush it in with detangling brush, scrunch, rinse, scrunch out some excess water so it's not dripping wet.\n\nOut of shower- I use a spray bottle to keep my hair moist, separate crown from rest of hair, then further separate the crown into 3 sections coronally. Separate the non crown section into two layers. \n\nStarting at the bottom layer I brush in Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream with my detangling brush, scrunch, further separate into smaller sections, brush in Curlsmith Curl Defining Styling Souffle, scrunch, use the Bounce Curl Define EdgeLift Brush and brush from under the hair pulling up and away from my scalp, scrunch. Repeat on the upper layer. Flip my head over and do this for my crown sections working back to front. Spot correct some curls that dried super scraggly and frizzy by spraying them with water and finger curling.\n\nAir dry. I have a fan that I sometimes sit in front of but never very strong wind cuz I'm scared of making the curls frizz. Once fully dry flip my head over and put a satin scrunchie around the hair (not tying it up tight, just surrounding the hair as a single loop) gather it into a satin bonnet and go to bed.\n\nIn the morning rub a few drops of Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Oil Mist on my hands (Not the one with cocoa butter. It says it's a body oil but had all the same ingredients as the hair oils I saw and was cheaper??) scrunch out hair for a few minutes, shake the roots out and fluff as best I can, spot correct curls that look like they're made of pure frizz.\n\nThanks for reading, ik it was a long post and I appreciate any advice!

I’m going to try my best to outline my routine below:\n\nMornings:\n\n\\- Wash with cetaphil nourishing oil to foam cleanser OR prequel facial gleanser (only when feeling with outbreaks)\n\n\\- Moisturizing with cera ve moisturizing cream or prequel urea advanced relief moisturizing milk\n\nEvenings:\n\n\\- If I wore makeup I will use a damp makeup eraser towel\n\n\\- Wash with cetaphil sa cleanser\n\n\\- Same morning moisturizers\n\nIt’s important to note that I have very, very delicate\\* \\*skin. I did accutane in 2019, the results were great and I never had a “major” breakout until now.
