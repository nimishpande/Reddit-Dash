      "content": "I went to derm last week for dull skin texture issues, brought my current routine which is like 8 products totaling $400 from sephora. she looked at it and said okay but how much water are you drinking daily lol\n\nI was like idk enough?? she said track it for 2 weeks and come back before we add any prescriptions. I was annoyed bc like I came for solutions not homework but started tracking with waterminder to prove I drink enough and turns out I average 30oz a day which is apparently nowhere close to adequate for skin health. She's recommending 80oz minimum before we discuss adding anything else to my routine.\n\nI've been hitting 70-80oz for past week and my skin already looks more plump, texture is smoothing out, that dull tired look is improving. Ofc Im still using my products but the internal hydration was clearly the missing piece\n\nI feel dumb for spending $400 when the solution was free tap water but at least I know now. If your skin looks dehydrated maybe check your actual water intake before buying more serums",

I’ve been doing that for a year now. I asked them to let me see a dermatologist, but they say it’s a waste of money and they’re not allowing me to go.\n\nThey also don’t want me to cut my hair (it’s almost back-length). My mom says I don’t comb daily, and when I comb after one day, that much hair fall is normal. But I usually keep my hair in a braid and comb only 2–3 times a week because I’m scared of losing more hair.\n\nWhat should I do? Is there any oil or home remedy? I’ve been using homemade oil but it’s not working.",

I have a total of 8 between both feet.\n\nMy dermatologist has treated me with cryo every visit, beetle juice in almost every visit, and she has tried Cimetidine, Bleomycin, Imiquimod, and most recently even did surgery to cut it out and cauterize the big one.\n\nDespite all of this, and seeing her almost every other month, there is little to no progress. I’m at my wit‘s end and don’t know what to do. It’s impacting my life massively and I don’t know if a different doctor is the move, a different type of specialist (Podiatrist maybe?), or if I should go more extreme and push for laser surgery.\n\nAny advice would be helpful.

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

It means  I dont want to wear it wavy, the rest I can pin back/ do half and half but Ive got a 5 head and so like to keep bits at the front but it just looks a mess. \nI have regular cuts etc and have tried finger coiling and using a denman brush to shape but doing that means im going against the curl halfway down because it changes direction and so it unravels and just looks a mess. My routine works for the rest of my hair but absolutely not the front. Any suggestions or people with similar issues? I want it to be fairly low maintenance so I dont tend to shape the rest of it, just brush through product and scrunch a bit.\n\nMy routine is ouai curl cream and gel then diffuser or leave to dry. ",
