Ill post pics of what i use and my skin and if this isnt the right spot then ill find and post elsewhere. I wash my face once a day at night before I go to bed. I use a wet towel to wash the soap off my face and to dry my face because I get water all over the place when trying to wash the product off in the sink and its really frustrating. I cant use ceraVe stuff on my face since that made me itchy and didn't help my face at all. I try to avoid super expensive things because i just cant afford them.

I also then look at it from different angles and I just think it looks nasty. I was wondering if anyone knows any hair styles that would go good or maybe even ways to style it? Even if you guys think it looks good I still don't think it suits me all that much and I'd wanna look into other styles. I don't really know what I want or how to figure out how to style and stuff, so that's why I'm asking. I know it might be a little farfetched but I don't like how flat and greasy some part of my hair look and was wondering if I could maybe cook something up that's a little curly like these photos from Pinterest. I was thinking maybe hair products like curl cream, texture powder, or maybe even a perm, but I just wanna know since I'm clueless. I'm really insecure about my hair so thanks a lot.",

Day two it's a coin toss between good again or barely average.

I know I need it and I know losing some length will help my curls bounce up :) \n\nAfter spending all of 2025 trying this that and the other I am realizing that everything I have tried (curl creams, mousse, foam, leave -in, gel) weighs down my hair- even watered down versions of leave-in and gel in a spray bottle which was hardly any product. Did a clarifying shampoo the other day and removed all silicones and my hair feels light and bouncy like it used to. Now I know my hair doesn’t like silicones so much and everything I’ve tried has weighed it down so I’m back to where I started a year ago. Can anyone recommend silicone free styling products that are truly lightweight? The lightest of the light weight!! I’d love more definition of my waves/curls, but I do still need to detangle at night so I’m happy to refresh on day 2.\n\nHair type: low porosity, fine, low density, 2b/2c/3a waves and curls \n\nCurrent routine:\n\nOdele clarifying shampoo\n\nAussie waves shampoo (for second shampoo)\n\nMaui hibiscus conditioner (and combing through my hair wet in the shower)\n\nDrying with t shirt wrapped around my head (plopping has always made my curls weird somehow)\n\nAir dry with roots clipped up or diffusing on no heat low speed\n\nVery gentle detangle at night and morning (I must do this to avoid very stressful matting)\n\nJojoba oil on ends and lengths\n\nProtective style with satin bonnet\n\nAny advice is appreciated thank you thank you !!

I dont blow dry either coz I've tried many times even with cold air and it makes me look like a witch lol. So I just air dry now. I also dont brush my hair.. just use my hands.. I'm really not into using styling products either, it's too much stress and weighs my hair down and make it look greasy, just wanna nourish them from within.

A week ago I re-started my birth control after being off it for 5 months (insurance issues). Before all this my skin was dry and riddled with eczema but it was clear of acne. I’m not sure exactly what caused it and I’m getting frustrated as it doesn’t seem to be going away. I’m going to try my best to outline my routine below:\n\nMornings:\n\n\\- Wash with cetaphil nourishing oil to foam cleanser OR prequel facial gleanser (only when feeling with outbreaks)\n\n\\- Moisturizing with cera ve moisturizing cream or prequel urea advanced relief moisturizing milk\n\nEvenings:\n\n\\- If I wore makeup I will use a damp makeup eraser towel\n\n\\- Wash with cetaphil sa cleanser\n\n\\- Same morning moisturizers\n\nIt’s important to note that I have very, very delicate\\* \\*skin. I did accutane in 2019, the results were great and I never had a “major” breakout until now. I also have some allergies to common ingredients in skincare like quaternium and anything formaldehyde related. I just recently moved so I don’t currently have a derm but I will be looking for one.

And it’s like almost near my waist so I know it’s probably being weighed down but I would really not like to cut it off.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciate!!\n\nMy current routine is:  \n\\-Shower (elvive nourishing shampoo and conditioner) and I leave in conditioner for a while before detangling and washing out  \n\\-Use the John Freida mousse using prayer hands and then scrunch in after.  \n\\-Then I use the Eco style argon oil gel and scrunch it in (I don’t put my head upside down by the way. I don’t know if that help) and it just kind of stays curly for a few seconds like 30 seconds and then falls. I make sure my hairs wet whilst doing this.  \n\\-Then I use a cotton t-shirt to microplop and then I have to go to sleep so I put on a silk bonnet and hope for the best.

      "content": "I know this is probably a weird question but I have a problem with obsessively popping/picking my pimples. It makes my acne flare up due to this and I want it to stop.\n\nI have tried acne patches but it doesn't really help with my obsessive picking. The clear acne patches easily fall off and I tend to still pick them because I can feel the bump. The only solution I have found to prevent me from picking/popping pimples are bandaids. I cannot feel the bump on bandaids so I do not pick them when I use a bandaid.\n\nBandaids look like something happened to me and makes people question. I don't like being asked this nor do I want people do worry about me for no reason. I also read bandaids aren't really recommended for long term use for acne. As it can make scarring worse.\n\nI am wondering if there is any particular brand that \\\\\\*feel\\\\\\* like a rough bandaid. Where it is not clear or thin where I can see/feel it either. I need to be unable to feel the bump on my face. I just need patches I can use long term that have that particular bandaid texture.\n\nI hope I make sense. I am sure there are also some obsessive compulsive pimple poppers here too and understand what I mean.",
