Fucked up my mental pretty hard so I went to another one and basically had to convince her to give me Finasterid (this doctor also is not deep in hair loss).\nStarted taking 0.5mg at the first picture cause I was scared about sides. Had a tiny bit of pain in the balls every now and then for 2 weeks and increased libido and then everything went back to completely normal.\nAfter a year I decided to up the dose now to 1mg before going for a transplant (mainly the hairline is fucked)\nI experienced pretty hard shedding for 2 months with like 100+ hairs in the sink, which got me flashbacks to the times I was not on it and wasn't easy on the mind but pulled through.\nNow it's looking better than ever and just got done with my hairtransplant.",

      "content": "So lately I've been seeing a lot of posts saying CeraVe has moved it's manufacturing in India for the Indian market and they are giving low quality or different ingredients as compared to its US or EU counterparts. \n\nSo, I took some time and did some digging on one of it's products (more comparisons may come soon): \n\nCeraVe Foaming Cleanser:\n\nLeft (India) &amp; Right (USA)\n\nAs you can see in the above comparison, Indian one is almost neck to neck similar with the USA one. It's also Paraben free and Reef safe. \n\nNext I checked the full ingredients list. Here's what I found:\n\nThere are a few differences within the ingredients:\n\nHumectants: India uses Propanediol | USA uses Propylene Glycol\n\nHyaluronic Form: India uses Sodium Hyaluronate | USA uses Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid\n\nPreservatives: India uses Phenoxyethanol and Ethylhexylglycerin | USA uses Parabens, like Methylparaben &amp; Propylparaben\n\nRest all ingredients as similar to the USA variant!!!\n\nRight now I just kept it short and simple. Let me know if you guys wanna see more of such comparisons 🙂",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I have just started exploring using products on my hair and wanted to get some tips. Before a week ago I never wore my hair down, having it in a low bun at all times of the day for YEARS, so I never really learned what to do with it. I only washed my hair every few days which is good, but I didn't even really use conditioner so I'm not sure what state my hair is in. I haven't changed my shampoo or conditioner, but have started using them properly and now added more products. \n\nI'm pretty sure I have fine hair, probably also dry, and a mix of 2c-3b. It dries extremely quickly, so I think it's low porosity? My issue is I don't think I'm getting a real gel cast. It depends on how literal the phrase \"scrunch out the crunch\" is, but I'm not getting anything really crunchy, maybe a bit stiff but nothing like hairspray crispy. This is my third wash day, previously I tried just scrunching in the gel but I think brushing it in worked better, that's the only change between the 3 days. It looks nice enough all pulled forward like the first picture, but the second picture taken 30 minutes later shows how it actually is very stringy and frizzy. It's like the pretty ringlets are hiding under a layer of thin frizz and only show themselves when I pull it all forward. \n\nI noticed the front section of my crown looked better than the rest of it and Im 90% sure I accidentally put gel in that section twice cuz I got distracted. So maybe I need more gel? But it feels like I'm using a lot and that section still didn't get actually crunchy. Maybe I add a curl cream? It also only lasts 2-3 days despite the bonnet and idk if that's the norm or not. Im gonna try to be as specific as possible with this routine so PLEASE critique literally anything you think I could do differently.\n\nNotes: I clarified with a shampoo that has sulfates a few days ago, and I know I need more layers to get volume at the roots, and I know that having longer hair just makes the curls more likely to be flat. So maybe don't comment that unless there's something more specific I'm missing! I also know that air drying isn't going to be as good as a diffuser but I am not ready for it and want to perfect what I can right now. Ty :)\n\nMy current routine: \n\nIn shower- shampoo twice with Aveda Rosemary Mint Purifying Shampoo, condition with Aveda Rosemary Mint Weightless Conditioner, brush it in with detangling brush, scrunch, rinse, scrunch out some excess water so it's not dripping wet.\n\nOut of shower- I use a spray bottle to keep my hair moist, separate crown from rest of hair, then further separate the crown into 3 sections coronally. Separate the non crown section into two layers. \n\nStarting at the bottom layer I brush in Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream with my detangling brush, scrunch, further separate into smaller sections, brush in Curlsmith Curl Defining Styling Souffle, scrunch, use the Bounce Curl Define EdgeLift Brush and brush from under the hair pulling up and away from my scalp, scrunch. Repeat on the upper layer. Flip my head over and do this for my crown sections working back to front. Spot correct some curls that dried super scraggly and frizzy by spraying them with water and finger curling.\n\nAir dry. I have a fan that I sometimes sit in front of but never very strong wind cuz I'm scared of making the curls frizz. Once fully dry flip my head over and put a satin scrunchie around the hair (not tying it up tight, just surrounding the hair as a single loop) gather it into a satin bonnet and go to bed.\n\nIn the morning rub a few drops of Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Oil Mist on my hands (Not the one with cocoa butter. It says it's a body oil but had all the same ingredients as the hair oils I saw and was cheaper??) scrunch out hair for a few minutes, shake the roots out and fluff as best I can, spot correct curls that look like they're made of pure frizz.\n\nThanks for reading, ik it was a long post and I appreciate any advice!

      "content": "My son is 5 and got a haircut in March 2025. I called everywhere and verified they were a curl specialist and knew how to cut curly hair before making the appointment. The first 3 pics are of my son’s hair before the cut, next 2 are after the cut and the last two are now how it always looks now and the school pic is “styled”. I’ve given it so much time and they are just ruined 😭  when his hair is wet or he sweats it still curls up and he has ringlets, so I know the curls are still there. But now his hair is super thick and poofy and the curls are not defined and won’t hold. His dad has 3b hair. All the men in the family do. I can try to style it but it’s never like before and the curls won’t stay. Is there any way to fix this? Please tell me what to do. Curly hair is new to me and my husband always just shaved his off. I actually had him grow it out so I could see what it looks like. (It’s GORGEOUS)\n\nRoutine is wash once a week, we use as I am coconut cowash, comb through while wet, microfiber towel dry, sometimes use curlychic leave in (I’ve been playing with that to see if not using makes a difference, maybe it’s too heavy?) I also have tried purad’or organic argan oil and Jamaican black castor oil but that one is too greasy/heavy.  I’ve also tried the Cantù curly kids line (shampoo, styling custard, leave in, curling cream) with no difference. I am open to any and all advice please and will buy whatever needed.",

I don't even want to go to hair saloon because they once told me I should take care of my hair. Nobody understands how deeply painful this is.Sure I do have other problems in my life but nothing hurts as hairloss does.I can never accept this.Im just post shower and looking at my wet scalp and crying.Even my boyfriend doesn't understand me ,he tells me just take vitamins ,but all my vitamin levels are good.Im so scared if he leave me if my hair loss gets worse.People are making fun of balding men but as a women this shit is 10× times worse and hopeless.If I had other types of alopecia or on chemo ,I'd at least have some hope my hair would come back but instead I'm watching my hair slowly go away..I can't even imagine myself in 10 years.In where I live its hard to find good toppers,wig etc,.How can I accept myself while everyone is talking about how hair is important for women?I'm sorry if what I wrote triggered anyone,I'm just so fucking exhausted,wanted to share.",

Maybe you lovely people could suggest any changes to help get a bit more definition and less poofiness? You can see my hair is really trying!! I would love just some nice beach waves to be honest. And my curtain bangs to be less weird shaped haha \n\n2 washes ago I started! I double shampooed, first with head n shoulders and then with the L’Oréal clarifying shampoo as shown in pic 3. I wash hair like once or twice a week and it’s so thick I tend to shampoo twice to get it nice and clean. Planning to use L’Oréal shampoo every couple of weeks or so as our water is very hard here. \n\nMy routine: double shampoo using head and shoulders, then use wella conditioner in pic 3 and let it sit while I wash my body. Then rinse and plop for a bit with my towel before applying the garnier curl cream, scrunch it a bit with my hands and then try not to touch it and pray that my daughter doesn’t pull the crap out of it… once it is dry I add a bit of the argan oil serum in like a wiping and scrunching motion on the frizzy bits and ends. \n\nI’m trying not to buy more crap I don’t need so not sure I need to invest in silk pillows and special microfibre towels? My hair is too thick for a T-shirt to plop with I think. ",

This medication basically worked by drying out his skin so it didn’t have the oil needed to produce acne (it was the early 2000s so who knows what kind of crap they were giving him lol) But ever since then, even now almost 20yrs after stopping the medication, he has struggled with desert dry skin. To the point that it gets cracked and becomes super painful for him.\n\nNow, I have told him a MILLION times that if he doesn’t atLEAST apply a moisturizer every day it’s never going to get better. But he INSISTS that no matter what it won’t change anything and says he hates feeling sticky from a lotion/moisturizer…\n\nSo I’m here. BEGGING the people of the internet for some opinions on what I can do for him? What kind of holy grail products do you or your man SWEAR by for soft skin?! He says his leg hair also makes it hard for him but I know they make stuff just for men so I HAVE to believe there is SOMETHING out there for him🥹\n\nPlease leave ALL comments, questions and/or suggestions here so I can prove to him that he’s not alone AND there is something out there that will help him😭🙏\n\n\\*PS - I have been looking into getting him an in shower lotion. Do those actually work? I’ve heard mixed reviews but no one seems to have strong feelings either way so I’m wondering if it’s worth a shot? Maybe bc he rinses it off he would be more inclined? I don’t know I’m just grasping at straws here 🙈😂🤷🏻‍♀️",

Very red, very splotchy.\n\nI use right now haruharu Black Rice Cleanser, witch hazel (alcohol free), Paula’s Choice Collagen moisturizer and top it with CeraVe healing ointment. \n\nI don’t wash my face everyday, as it seems to make everything worse. On days I don’t wash I use micellar water. \n\nPlease help, I’m so frustrated. ",

Thick individual strands but not a ton of density.\n\nroutine: \n\nshampoo: TGIN rose water shampoo for regular wash days, OUAI detox for deep cleaning\n\nconditioner: I almost never use this because it weighs my hair down but I do deep condition occasionally with Rizo’s deep conditioning or do a hair mask with Pattern transition mask \n\n  \ntreatments done to hair: occasional hair dye, no lifting used. maybe 1-2x/year. recently accidentally used permanent dye at home with ion hair color :( \n\nstyling products:\n\nTGIN rose water leave in condish (my holy grail fav product)\n\nTGIN hydrating curl cream \n\nmiss Jessie’s pillow soft curl gel for harder hold, or ouidad for lighter and humid days\n\napplication: typically apply all products while hair is soaking wet and add more water while applying. I dont separate the layers of my hair and do the rake and shake method. too lazy and it’s hard. I just comb leave in through my ends, part my hair how I prefer, then use praying hands to apply and rake through all other styling products. then I flip my head over upside down, shake left/right and up/down to get my natural curl clumps, and scrunch to the heavens. I’ll flip back up and scrunch a few times again before I throw my hair into a microfiber hair towel to plop for \\~20-30 mins. After, I take my hair out, rescrunch again, and I usually just let my hair air dry.\n\nwill hover diffuse my hair dry with warm/high settings on my cheap conair hair dryer until \\~75% dry and let hair dry if I’m feeling extra, but I almost always get frizz and don’t like my curls as much. \n\nsleep: I pineapple my hair and sleep on regular cotton pillow cases. I know I should wear a bonnet or use a satin case but I get so hot and can’t stand anything on my head when I sleep.",

      "content": "I have been going to the same Med Spa for the past 6 months, we’ve been doing monthly hydra facials and trying to get me on a good routine because honestly before I was trying so many thing I never gave anything enough time to work. Well about 2 months ago I let one of the estheticians know that I felt like my skin was feeling on the dry side (which is crazy because I normally have oily skin) and I was having crazy breakouts because there wasn’t really a whole lot of moisture in the products we were using. I think my skin barrier was screaming for help so she gave me a lipid serum and that helped A-LOT. \n\nFast forward to last weekend I got my very first chemical peel. I did the perfect Derma peel and it has been an… interesting process. I did not sheet peel like most people my peeling has been in a ton of small pieces. I am on day 7 and I am still peeling quite a bit around my whole face. I truly think it’s going to be over 10 days before I am done peeling fully. The skin that has peeled though is so dry. I talked to my esthetician and she told me to get the cerave healing ointment and to put a very light bit on at night which I did last night and it really helped BUT i feel like once the peeling is done I want something different. I want to help out my barrier because I do not want to breakout like I did last time my barrier was compromised. I want to talk to my esthetician about it but idk what products to ask her about so that’s why I am here. \n\nI would assume a chemical peel would do some damage to your skin barrier but idk which products to ask my esthetician about for after the peeling process that would actually be helpful. Anyone have any recommendations? Or am I overthinking this and over time my skin will be hydrated again I am just being impatient?",

I’ve been doing that for a year now. I asked them to let me see a dermatologist, but they say it’s a waste of money and they’re not allowing me to go.\n\nThey also don’t want me to cut my hair (it’s almost back-length). My mom says I don’t comb daily, and when I comb after one day, that much hair fall is normal. But I usually keep my hair in a braid and comb only 2–3 times a week because I’m scared of losing more hair.\n\nWhat should I do? Is there any oil or home remedy? I’ve been using homemade oil but it’s not working.",

      "content": "I have naturally curly hair, or at least I did as a child (photos attached as proof). I had ringlets when I was itty bitty, and it got less and less so as I got older. I was never taught how to care for my curls and it was treated as straight hair which made taking care of it as an overwhelmed autistic child absolutely awful 😭 I've spent my teenage and young adult years denying my curls and trying to hide them completely, but I don't want to anymore! I can't find things that pertain to short hair like mine and I'm struggling to live up to my fullest curl potential. The first photo is about 12 hours after a shower.\n\nMy current routine:\nI don't use curly specific shampoo or conditioner, I use refillable bottles that I refill at our local eco grocery store.\n\nDry with an old shirt by scrunching\n\nComb with a wide toothed comb\n\nA small amount of Marc Anthony curl cream\n\nSome Marc Anthony beach spray\n\nScrunch and hope for the best\n\nSometimes I use a blow dryer with a diffuser, but that is dependant on my energy level\n\nMy curls seem to look better the day after a shower, but never as good as they look when leaving from a haircut. I've been trying to figure this out for the last year now and I have made some good strides, but I feel like I could be doing more/better but I don't know where to start or what to change or do different.\n\nHonestly I could use any general tips or advice, but specifically...\n\n1. Are there any specific after-shower products that I should be looking into?\n\n2. Is Marc Anthony a decent brand? I honestly gravitated to it because the packaging was my favourite colour and I didn't know where else to start.\n\n3. Does curl shampoo/conditioner actually make a difference? I didn't notice anything significant when I was using it. \n\n4. Is there anything that I should be doing different or adding to my routine? \n\nThank you 🥰",
