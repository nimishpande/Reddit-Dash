      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe‚Ñ¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I don't think I have fungal acne.   \n  \nOld routine:\n\nAM: wash with water, Ole Henriksen Peptide Boost Moisturizer, sometimes Ole Henriksen vitamin C\n\nPM: wash with FAB gentle skin cleanser, exfoliate with PC BHA or PC Mandelic Acid every 3 nights, Ole Henriksen Peptide Boost Moisturizer\n\nI tried the Aveeno Oat Gel Cream and it clogged my pores more. I tried the Purito Oat In Calming Gel Cream and I actually think it's helped with my pores within just a few days BUT I woke up with tons of whiteheads all over my face and that's never been an issue for me before. According to what I read there's no actives so this shouldn't be purging? I think my skin might be unhappy with the squalane but I'm not 100% sure. Also I'm out of the OH moisturizer so as much as I don't want to try too many new moisturizers at once I kind of have to :(\n\nI've spent so much time reading through articles and reddit and I got super overwhelmed and would love to hear from anyone that might have advice.",

I stopped using serums because they didn‚Äôt help. I wash my face with the Simple Face Wash twice a day and use Vaseline for my lips.\n\nAt night, I sometimes apply the epiduo cream prescribed by my dermatologist for 15 minutes before washing it off, it helps with my acne.

      "title": "Is this a problem with the lash lift, my lashes, or my lash care?",
      "content": "I started getting a lash lift/tint combo back in March of this year from a new salon. Before that, I regularly had my lashes tinted at a different salon for years but they didn‚Äôt offer lifts.\n\nI use a lash serum twice a day on the top lash line and a conditioner on the lashes themselves every night. I rarely wear mascara and, if I do, it‚Äôs a tubing mascara once a month, maybe twice. I don‚Äôt wear eye shadow. The only serums I put on my lids are the typology wrinkles serum and cream and usually that‚Äôs just the outer corners. I go in with no eye makeup on and she cleans the whole area before starting anything. \n\nI started out getting my lashes done about every 6 weeks along with a brow wax and tint (same as I did with just the tint alone). I felt like they had fallen out, gotten new lashes growing in, or the tint had significantly faded on my bleach blonde lashes by week 5, so I switched to every 5 weeks. \n\nThe very first time I had my lashes lifted, she used a small rod and it was wayyy over curled. I have hooded eyes and these lashes were hidden underneath and poking back into my lid. I couldn‚Äôt wear any mascara. I thought it was just my hooded lids, so I didn‚Äôt say anything that first time until I came back for the second time. \n\nThe next time I went in and the last 3-4 times since then, she‚Äôs used a medium rod and it seems to be the right size. The large rod looks too big and the outer corners seem perfectly curled with the medium. The problem is, they‚Äôll look perfect once she removes everything and shows them to me, but the inner corners and maybe some other random lashes will start to over curl within an hour or so after leaving. I‚Äôve only had them stay mostly the same as when I left 1 time. \n\nI‚Äôve mentioned this to her, which is why we switched from a small rod to a medium rod the first time. Since then she says she‚Äôs tried: processing the inner corners last, processing them for the shortest time (I think she said 3 minutes but she may have said 1 minute), I think she also said she‚Äôs tried to not process the lashes that still looked over curled, not using the cellophane stuff to keep the heat as high, and she talked about placement of the solutions on the lash as well. She even thought maybe the heat of the wax on the brows was causing extra heat in some spots near my lashes. \n\nThe last time I went in (3 days before the photos), they came out looking perfect. She removed everything, showed me the lashes, and I loved them. She tinted my brows, and while they were sitting, the inner corners curled to an extreme again. So it obviously wasn‚Äôt the brow wax. She brought in the store owner and main lady and they discussed. Every possible solution her boss brought up, she had done. They were super confused. She does the most lash lifts + tints of any tech in the salon and she‚Äôs never had this issue where she can‚Äôt fix it with some adjustments. \n\nI have extremely sensitive skin but it never burned. Maybe some irritation but never a burn. The lashes don‚Äôt feel crispy or dry, they don‚Äôt look crispy or dry, and they don‚Äôt fall out quickly. We‚Äôre all at a loss. I think we discussed trying the large rod next time but I think the outer corners will be too straight if we do that. \n\nAnyone had a similar problem or have any ideas of what to try? Do I need to adjust my lash care or find a new tech? Is the large rod my only solution? Thanks for any help!",
