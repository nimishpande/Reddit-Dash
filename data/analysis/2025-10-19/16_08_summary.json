For the last few months they have been so limp and lifeless. I finished my bottle of expensive curly conditioner and just could not afford another $40-$50 for a small tube. \n\nSo off I went to Walmart and picked up *Tresemme Botanique Nourish &amp; Replenish* for $6. I've done 2 washdays with it now and the difference is incredible. I haven't changed anything else in my routine and my curls haven't looked this good in forever! \n\nJust goes to show that more expensive does not always = better.

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Ok embarrassing story time. \n\nI tried a new salon for a Brazilian wax and the lady was super kind and she did an amazing job- no issues. After her services she told me that the next time I book through the phone or website, I should mention the fact that I am pregnant so that she can use a type of wax ‘more suitable for sensitive skin’. I booked another appt a couple months later via online and mentioned in the notes that I was pregnant. Same experience with no issues. Then when it was time for my third appointment, I booked online and noticed that they added a ‘Maternity Brazilian’ option that was $10 more than the regular Brazilian option. This honestly caught me so off guard and now I feel super self conscious about coming back. This salon is Korean owned and a majority of their clientele are Korean. I’m also East Asian (just not Korean) and to be honest, I don’t grow a TON of hair down there and I make sure to shower before every appt. I feel personally attacked by this ‘maternity Brazilian’ option because I feel like it was added specifically for me 😭 is this a thing? ",

I think at 30, it makes me look older too. I have lots of pockmarks/enlarged pores and some wrinkles already. My face is also constantly kind of reddish (if I raise my brows and lower them quickly, pale creaselines briefly appear on my forehead). \n\nAfter wash, my face feels tense, dry, flaky and sensitive. My skin gets oily quickly, so much so that if I sweat or stay up late, the oil from my eyelids creeps into my eyes and burns. Despite washing my face every night before bed, my pillowcases start to feel like waxed canvas in 5 days or so 🤢\n\nIn the summer, sweating, heat and sun make it worse. In the winter, it's coldness, dry air and heating.\n\nI'm pretty clueless when it comes to cosmetics. The second photo shows my current skincare routine. The toner has a pH of 5,5. I've occasionally tested some pharmacy products and stuff from Body Shop (gel moisturizer with algae?) but they didn't seem to make much difference.\n\nAny routine or product recommendations (based in EU) appreciated!

So I have a few questions for everyone! How did you juggle the cost with your preferred style? I have been quoted upwards of $300-$400 for bridal hair, but I want to wear my hair down mostly. That feels like a lot of money for not-an-up-do. \n\nDid stylists start with your hair wet and use their own/your products or did you do your own curly hair routine and then the stylist worked with it dry? \n\nI think ultimately I would love to have my hair mostly down and with my natural curls, but a few of the wonky or frizzy parts corrected with a wand. Then maybe some sort of hair piece that stays in all night like a fancy headband or something. Something where I feel like the most elevated version of myself! \n\nI have considered doing my own hair but that feels like SUCH a gamble and I would only wear it down with no styling and I think the look would feel incomplete. My bridesmaids also have requested a hair stylist and I think it would be challenging to find someone for just them and no bride where a stylist can make the most of their money! \n\nHere's a picture from a photoshoot I did from an album photo shoot (I'm a musician) that I think shows off my curls and currently hair style pretty well! \n\nWould love any tips and tricks from the brides here! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jg7tqdnkk2wf1.jpg?width=4527&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b65cb765b26098c6f13ebb8c985b0e6a6966c86e\n\n",

Skin on my face is extremely, and I mean EXTREMELY, oily. I have a lot of blackheads, especially on my nose, and my skin feels like sand paper. At times when I do go out my skin is a tiny bit less oily, but I cannot go out more than I do now. What can I do? I honestly gave up trying different skin care products and I've only been using basic Dove creme soap and Nivea creme. I tried going to a dermatologist but I'm not sure what to say about that. I wasn't really taken seriously.\n\nIs there something that could help with that God forsaken oiliness? I'm a bit insecure about my skin and its so frustrating when I can't go without an oily mess on my face for 10 minutes. I live in Europe so preferably something that is available here? It would be nice if a product was vegan and cruelty free too, but I understand if that is too much to ask for, hahahaha. Thank you in advance &lt;3333",

I’ve also been having some acne breakouts, likely because I don’t know what I’m doing anymore. \n\nMy skin used to be mostly dry to combination but now it’s oily. I don’t know what products to use for oily skin. I also don’t really have a routine anymore, not that I had much of one to begin with, because I didn’t really need to use much during pregnancy and now I struggle with making sure to take the time for skin care.  As for the acne, I’m having a mild breakout and I think it’s probably from all the oil that I didn’t used to have. \n\nAdmittedly I don’t really know much about skin care or how to properly do a routine. My old routine was essentially wash my face with a cleanser in the shower and put on moisturizing lotion.\n\nPlease help me with what products to use for my oily skin and acne and help me get a routine that doesn’t take too much time!\n\nThank you for any advice, tips and/or help!",

I want to lean in to letting my Irish curls do their thing, but I have one major obstacle- I LOVE taking baths every night. They are totally non-negotiable for me, it’s my time to relax, read, and destress after the craziness of full time job, parenting and all the other fun things life throws my way. I have yet to find a cap that keeps my hair dry, so wondering if there is a way to make this work.\n\nI bath at night and only wash my hair every-other day, so it’s less an issue of washing, not of getting it wet. I do use conditioner every day. \n\nRight now my routine is something like:\nWash (not every day)\nCondition\nTowel off gently\nAir dry for a bit\nPut in top knot to sleep\nWake up, spritz with heat protectant or argan oil\nBlow dry\nCurl (or just leave, if I’m not doing anything where I need to look nice)\n\nClearly I need to redo several of these steps, but mainly wondering how to incorporate nightly baths into whatever routine I do. Any suggestions?\n\nLove this group and love seeing all your amazing curls!!!",

I'm 29, very pale, at this time of year my skin gets quite dry, I'm pretty bad at remembering to Moisturise but I do wash my face every day, I use Neutrogena clear and defend face wash that keeps any spots at bay, and Simple kind to skin light Moisturiser (when I remember), generally speaking except some dryness and oily skin around my nose my skin is pretty good which is why I don't pay too much attention on it, I just feel like I don't know where to start and would love recommendations of products! I do also get dry skin on my hands, feet and elbows. Thank you so much in advance for any hints/tips!",
