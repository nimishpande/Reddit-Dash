For the last few months they have been so limp and lifeless. I finished my bottle of expensive curly conditioner and just could not afford another $40-$50 for a small tube. \n\nSo off I went to Walmart and picked up *Tresemme Botanique Nourish &amp; Replenish* for $6. I've done 2 washdays with it now and the difference is incredible. I haven't changed anything else in my routine and my curls haven't looked this good in forever! \n\nJust goes to show that more expensive does not always = better. We don't have to spend hundreds of dollars to have our dream curls. And don't be afraid to try things even if they aren't marketed towards curly hair.",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

(Any advice would be extremely appreciated!)\n\nMy family is on my mom and dad side are notorious for having really big recession in the temples and I started noticing it on myself too so I decided to hop on 1mg of finasteride. \n\nIve been taking it for about 6 and a half months now, I have not noticed any side effects (even in bed I can go for multiple rounds). I decided to start derma rolling and using minoxidil at night for the last 2 weeks because I haven’t seen from what I can tell any regrowth from finasteride atall.\n\nIve also started to try taking some supplements. I take protein powder, vitamin d3, k2 and Zinc, magnesium(all in one pill). Omega 3 fatty acids (consumed via a can of sardines). Lastly I just started some ashwaganda (300mg) a couple days ago so we’ll see if it will help manage stress.",

When wearing makeup I use the skin1004 oil cleanser.\n\nIn all honesty, my diet isn’t good because I’m living in a college dormitory with no fridge meaning I can’t eat vegetables or healthy gut foods like yogurt because they require a fridge and purchasing food everyday isn’t an option as I’m budgeting. I eat rice everyday and I can only eat canned goods like meat loaf, corned beef, and vienna sausages— however, I also have eggs and instant noodles. I try my best to cut the sodium and sugar, but living in a dormitory means that I have no fruits because most need to be refrigerated and the fruits in the supermarket are expensive.\n\nMy sleep schedule is also really messed up. I sleep at around 4-5 am, but I have silk pillow cases and I always change them frequently.\n\nI always stay hydrated, I always wear SPF even if I’m at home, and I’m taking pro and prebiotic supplements for my gut. \n\nSo why is it still there? It’s getting harder to look at myself everyday and I’m unsure which products to get too. I was thinking about going into accutane, but I know it has a lot of risks and I think my acne is still salvageable. I just need tips man, I’m trying to fix my sleep cycle but I physically can’t sleep. I’ve really tried my best to do everything I can to get rid of my acne.\n\nWhat do I do? 🙁\n\n",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "title": "“Irish Curls” Please Help",
      "content": "reposted because I forgot to cover my face in a photo.\n\n\n\nHi, I am new here, and looking for help with styling and caring for my hair. Sorry this is long. I’ve struggled with my hair my whole life. It’s always had wave in front and wavier in back, like ropes, so I mostly kept it long and wore it down to cover “Irish curls”. I started getting salon cuts as a kid and have had decades of layering and thinning it, and spent my teens and early 20s straightening it. A couple of years ago I decided to grow out the layers and thinning and trim the ends at home, and ended up with a giant curly bump under the back. Recently the bump became bigger and completely unmanageable, so I did some layering, and I have been stunned with how wavy/curly it is. \n\n\n\nMy biggest issue is that it’s still only slightly wavy in front even with diffusing. I do have a bad habit of touching the front of my hair so I’m trying to quit. Clarifying has also seemed to help a little. Did I cut front pieces too short? The front is finer but very thick, and the back is very coarse, tangles easily and very thick. I actually kind of like how it looks with just a scrunch, minimal product and air drying and think the front blends better, but I’m curious whether I can get it to look more like the back so I have the option of wearing it wavier.\n\n\n\nI’m not really sure I have a specific question, but has anyone else found a solution to Irish curls? I’m considering giving up and just growing it long again and using heatless curlers at night, but I’m only a few weeks in to CGM, so trying to not let myself quit. \n\n\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nWash Aveda sapmoss shampoo, nutriplenish conditioner. Lolavie or innersense protein mask every once in awhile when it feels dry. Styling: brush in shower while soaking wet then scrunch, Aveda be curly cream and or gel, brush in sections ecotools curl defining brush, scrunch with t shirt and diffuse \n\n\n\n\n\n* I haven’t colored it since 2017, and sun bum spray on lightener in 2022 once. very rarely use heat, haven’t straightened in about 15 years, stay out of the sun, and only wear it up in a clip. I love hot showers so am trying to use less hot water in the shower. Idk if the front is damaged, but it’s always been straighter than the back.\n* I have to use a clarifying shampoo often and wash daily to every other day because of a scalp condition. I try to make up for it with hydrating conditioner, masks, and leave in conditioner on ends.\n* We have very soft water.\n\n\n\nPics:\n\n1 My hair pre thinning as a kid. The front has some wave so I’m hopeful that will come back\n\n2 the bump pre layers\n\n3 layered no styling\n\n4 diffused\n\nThank you for any advice/ tips! ",

I am including a before photo of what it normally looks like. \n\nMy hair isn’t super curly, but it’s also not pin straight so I went to a stylist so see if she could help. She cut some face framing layers and showed me how to do the scrunching with gel and leave in conditioner. \n\nMy problem, I feel like it looks terrible. I can’t tell if it is the haircut, not doing the curls correctly, or me just not used to it. I feel like the curls themselves look okay, but it feels like my face shape looks really weird, and the short bits are blocking my face. \n\nAlso, it seems incredibly messy when I look at the top of my head, with chunks going in multiple directions. \n\nI will provide details of exactly what I did today as it is drying, and any help would be appreciated, trying not to freak out about if I made a mistake with this cut 😅\n\nRoutine\n\n1. Pantene multitasker shampoo and 5 in 1 conditioner \n\n2. In shower, brushed hair, then with soaking hair flipped it and applied as I am coconut leave in conditioner upside down, scrunching. \n\n3. Then applied Marc Anthony strictly curls curl envy cream upside down while scrunching. \n\n4. Plopped my hair in a long sleeved t-shirt and let sit for 20 minutes. \n\n5. Took out the plop and re arranged curls, letting air dry. \n\n6. No silk bonnet yet, one is in the mail. \n",

I use makeup very occasionally (like once or twice a month) for dance team competitions. It’s so overwhelming on the internet because everyone’s trying to promote their brand and I’m not sure what is actually good or bad for my skin. I tried natural remedies like haldi, honey, and yogurt masks, neem masks, multani mitti, etc. and I’ve been doing this for YEARS with barely any change. I have tried pretty much every cheap mask and skincare product, but it’s seriously been a decade at this point with no change (neutrogena salicylic acid wash, cera ve burns my skin, clearasil, benzoyl peroxide,0.1% adapalene cream (prescribed and made my skin burn) st Ives is just.. no)\n\n\\*\\*I have symptoms of hormonal imbalance and PCOS so I feel like this problem is less topical and maybe I just need to wait for my hormones to settle down ? This also causes things like increased hair growth so I shave/lazer that on my face. But I still want to see if maybe the products I’m using are doing more harm than good. I know Korean skincare is the biggest remedy right now, I have combination skin and Indian genetics so I’m not sure where to start. Aside from pimples I have pretty enlarged, clogged pores and redness. After I cleanse my skin feels very dry so I immediately put on my moisturizer. But then throughout the day my skin feels very oily especially on my cheeks, chin and the T zone. This is likely combination skin right ?\n\nMy morning and night skincare is just two products (with the right recommendations I’ll hopefully figure out a good routine) but it’s just the Neutrogena Salicylic Acid Oil Free Acne Wash (it’s the orange one) and Aveeno daily moisturizing face/body lotion. I use the face one usually but I could only find the body one this time. Sometimes I use the clearasil 5 in one and the freeman watermelon soothing gel mask when my skin breaks out more than usual, it feels like something’s happening but I’m worried it’s doing more harm to my skin barrier.\n\nMy skin is basically crying for help at this point. I feel bad even putting on makeup sometimes because I feel like I’m damaging it further. I’ve seen on TikTok people are using Dr melaxin and April skin to get their pores unclogged, I’m skeptical about whether or not to get them because I don’t know if they work or not. But after posting this I’m ready to just bite the bullet and get something new for a change.\n\nThank you guys so much for listening &lt;3 As I said this is my first Reddit post so please be understanding of that :)",

I'm experimenting w/ my styling routine right now, but that isn't what this post is abt, I might make a separate post abt that some other time\n2. I only put any of these products in my hair maybe 1x/mo\n3. My hair sees NO heat or chemical treatments like hair dye.\n4. I sleep with a satin pillow, but with my hair down because I don't know how to braid, and I'm not even sure if that would preserve my curls or not.\n5. I only wash my hair every 3 days or so, otherwise it dries out my hair/skin.\n6. I don't clarify bc I rarely use any products in my hair and I'll dry out my hair/skin if I do it as often as people say to (1x-2x/week). I currently don't even own a clarifying shampoo lol\n\n# Actual Post:\n\nI need help asking my hair stylist how to cut my hair! I've only ever been to the salon one time (in May), and I didn't like how it turned out in the end. I also wanted to know what it was that my stylist did to my curls to make them... do... that... This is my hair before the cut, then right after the cut (pls read the pics' captions):\n\n[No styling, no products or leave-in, air dried, before the cut](https://preview.redd.it/ysskux9eu3wf1.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0da6ce18ac7f1a7e1de56380374c28d8c87a3ca9)\n\n[Air dry, styled using products that I don't remember, right before my haircut](https://preview.redd.it/dtdnvznku3wf1.png?width=1415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11e4899abcd67317b80c28c612790fada6ba76ae)\n\n[This was IN the salon while I waited for my uber home AFTER the cut](https://preview.redd.it/c9exuwppu3wf1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee4267d725e603f5acc0c2ebc6670f32bc7b4a26)\n\n[This was when I got home from the salon in my bedroom](https://preview.redd.it/w6mmrufxu3wf1.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e90d4dd397a22a8e94f67f0fd24a7d7e6bf777f6)\n\n[This is the same cut, a few weeks later, using all the products I listed all at once and finger twirling, up in a ponytail for the wedding, so this is just my bangs. This is usually how I style my bangs, even if not with all the product all at once.](https://preview.redd.it/nurvqs40v3wf1.png?width=1239&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff703d7de00f8ae89a6c0718525b063d98822b91)\n\nI haven't been keeping up with the haircut (other than cutting my bangs and dead ends at home) because **I... REALLY don't like how the layering somehow made it look mullety :(** I asked for short layers because my hair before, as you can see, was really flat on the top then curly at the bottom. We focused on the bangs more than anything because the reference photos I had focused on girls with bangs and I didn't have bangs before.\n\n**I wanted basically the same hair shape as I already had, but cut in a U at the bottom, add layers to give myself more volume and to make my curls curl more and sooner on my head, and add bangs. Not a shag/mullet/triangle cut.**\n\nBut I honestly can't tell if this was on my stylist or if it was on me not knowing how to ask for a cut or knowing how haircuts work. I liked how my bangs turned out, I just didn't like the shape of the rest of my hair--how it looked like a shaggy mullet.\n\nAnd now that my hair is growing out, the layers and shape of it looked CHOPPED. The layers don't blend and the shape just seems kinda all over the place? Idk, I feel like it looks bad, but it's probably just part of the growing out process.\n\n[This is after using the \\* products listed in my routine. This haircut looks CHOPPED, bro 😭](https://preview.redd.it/9zvivob7v3wf1.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf71c0ec5a8273a4b51463c4e1b5c2fabae57204)\n\n**So, how do I ask for a proper haircut/style?** I keep seeing everyone's cuts and they end up GORGEOUS. Is my hair just not curly/full enough for it to look the way I want?\n\nI don't want to **not** go back to her because she was ***so*** sweet and cut me a deal since I'm no income and this was for a wedding I was in (I don't expect that every time and I DID still tip, dw), but idk, She didn't style the individual curls or anything like what I see in videos all the time.\n\nMy gf said that the mullet look came with asking for short layers, but like... I see everyone else getting layers and NOT getting mullets. So what's going on? **What went wrong?** What do I ask for to ensure I get the look I want? **U shape, only cut off the dead ends, bangs, convex layers, and ???** Am I just having unrealistic expectations because of my curl type vs. what I see?\n\nThis is more of what I had in mind for the shape of my hair outside of the bangs and what I was hoping for in terms of styling:\n\n[My hair has LOTS of spirals naturally, and spirals super easily with just finger twirling, I do it all the time. Granted, she has more hair than I do, for sure, but I was still hoping for something similar to this.](https://preview.redd.it/5um79rohv3wf1.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c672d1563c3bf2b898d9529beba58be915d8d096)\n\n**This is my current hair (please read captions):**\n\n[My hair is half dry here. No products, no leave-in, air dried. It frizzes out WAY more when it's fully dry and my curls\\/waves start slightly higher on my head than they do in this picture here. This is just a good shot of my natural curl pattern.](https://preview.redd.it/w6dmm8zpv3wf1.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=733548702c485f14e3efb93fdf49b4c2d0d7310d)\n\n[This is my hair with no products, no styling, not even finger-twirling my bangs like I usually do \\(see wedding photo\\), no leave-in, completely air dried. The frizz is INSANE.](https://preview.redd.it/vgpuqwmxv3wf1.png?width=1261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0abf43fe179705fa12875e2bed9d2c1e1f02bfdf)\n\nI'm really desperate because I'm at a point where I just really don't like my hair right now :( **Mayhaps I've been influenced,** but I'm just not feeling like it's not at its full curl potential and I thought a cut would help that but it didn't seem to and now I'm scared to go back.\n\n**Like, how do I find people with my hair type?** I feel like I can't find anyone that has hair very similar to mine, only kinda similar. This way I can find more realistic expectations of what to... expect from a style/cut?\n\nAn important part of the haircut that I want is that my curls start earlier on my head without looking like a shag/mullet cut or triangle shaped.\n\n# TL;DR/My Main Questions\n\n1. Pls read **all** image captions first\n2. WHAT did my hair stylist do to my curls!? They've NEVER looked like that before or since. Was this because she blowdried them??? I don't remember if she diffused or not :(\n3. How do I ask for a cut where they honor and cater to my individual curls? How do I make sure it adds volume without making it look shaggy or like a mullet or a triangle? (U shape, long and convex layers, bottleneck bangs, and what else?)\n4. Am I just being influenced? Do I have realistic expectations for my hair, or is this just how my hair is? Can I even achieve my goals with a haircut, or is this a matter of product/styling?\n\n# Thank you so much for all of your help!! 🥰🥰🥰",

      "content": "Hi there! \n\nI am getting married next october but working to book all my vendors now. I am struggling to find the right stylist for my hair. So I have a few questions for everyone! How did you juggle the cost with your preferred style? I have been quoted upwards of $300-$400 for bridal hair, but I want to wear my hair down mostly. That feels like a lot of money for not-an-up-do. \n\nDid stylists start with your hair wet and use their own/your products or did you do your own curly hair routine and then the stylist worked with it dry? \n\nI think ultimately I would love to have my hair mostly down and with my natural curls, but a few of the wonky or frizzy parts corrected with a wand. Then maybe some sort of hair piece that stays in all night like a fancy headband or something. Something where I feel like the most elevated version of myself! \n\nI have considered doing my own hair but that feels like SUCH a gamble and I would only wear it down with no styling and I think the look would feel incomplete. My bridesmaids also have requested a hair stylist and I think it would be challenging to find someone for just them and no bride where a stylist can make the most of their money! \n\nHere's a picture from a photoshoot I did from an album photo shoot (I'm a musician) that I think shows off my curls and currently hair style pretty well! \n\nWould love any tips and tricks from the brides here! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jg7tqdnkk2wf1.jpg?width=4527&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b65cb765b26098c6f13ebb8c985b0e6a6966c86e\n\n",
