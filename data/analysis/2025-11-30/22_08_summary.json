I have extremely coarse hair that doesn’t grow much past chin length. It’s not really curly and not straight either. I’ve felt ugly because of my hair ever since I was a little girl. I transferred $6k from my savings account and was ready to spend it on one premium wig and one mid-quality wig (shown in pics), but for some reason I just couldn’t do it. Instead I’ve been drying my hair with a diffuser and making it maximally puffy, which costs close to $0 (I did at one time have to buy the blow dryer, and I use a curl cream). So far I have no regrets. It feels like I’m giving the middle finger to society and its dumb beauty standards.",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I’ve tried deodorant sprays and after 2-5 hours my Bo mixes with the deodorant. Even just lifting my armpit up my boyfriend will tell me wow you smell terrible. I am already so insecure about it. What can I do ladies ? I can’t live like this forever. And I always choose not to wear t shirts or sleeved shirts because the smell mixing with a shirt is absolutely horrendous as well.

      "content": "I am very frustrated. I’ve never dyed my hair before, so I recognize that the change is probably shocking - but l think it’s more than that.\n\nTo preface: I have extremely dark (almost black) hair. The past few years, I started to develop a small 1-2 inch wide patch of white hair. I didn’t really mind it, but because my hair was so dark and it was concentrated in one spot, it really stuck out.\n\nMy original plan was to get balayage to add more color to my hair, so attention wasn’t drawn immediately to the white streak. When I mentioned this to my hairdresser, she immediately shut me down and said that wouldn’t work because “it wouldn’t cover the greys and would look funny.” But my goal was never to cover anything- I just wanted to bring more dimension (not sure if that’s the right word) to my hair, so that the white streak wasn’t the first thing everyone noticed. She recommended adding a few baby lights/highlights to blend my hair, which I agreed to. \n\nWell…. I got it done yesterday, and I went from not loving it/hoping it would grow on me to absolutely hating it. \n\nFirst and foremost: I don’t think the blonde works for me. The color just isn’t flattering, and I look washed out. (I’m not comfortable posting a picture of my face, so just trust me on this)\nSecondly: I think it’s just… bad. The left side of my hair looks like it has a different style than the right side: the left (pic 1) is much more blended toward the front, whereas the right (pic 2) has three distinct highlights. Also: the highlights don’t start until about 1/2 inch from my roots (which I understand needs to happen), but at some points it’s incredibly obvious, both when I wear it down and put it in a ponytail (pics #3, 4, 5).\n\nI really, REALLY wanted to love it and I keep trying to convince myself it will grow on me. But the more I look at myself in the mirror and in pictures, the more I hate it. My friends and my family say they love it, and it looks great. I can’t tell if they’re being genuine, or if they’re trying to spare my feelings.\n\nSo, strangers of Reddit, please give me your brutally honest opinion: are these highlights any good? What can I ask my hairdresser to fix, or should I just dye them back to my natural color?\n\nTL;DR: I got highlights to make some white hair less noticeable I hate them/think they’re poorly done. My friends and family say they love it/think it looks great. Are they being honest, or trying to spare my feelings?",

      "content": "Hello!\n\nSo a few months back my hair did a complete 180! I went from a very, very slight wave to tighter ones and even some ringlet formations. I’m pretty sure this was because I finally had a medical problem being addressed that was affecting my hair growth and overall health. But because of this, I’ve had to endure a steep learning curve on how to take care of my wavy/curly hair.\n\nIn the summer it wasn’t too bad — I live in Ireland, so the summer climate is kind of mild and didn’t affect my hair too much. But winter? Ugh, it’s so bad 😩 Yesterday, I spent ages styling my hair, but all the rain, humidity, and cold made it fall flat so quickly and left me with fuzzy frizz. I was so disappointed.\n\n**My routine yesterday:**\n\n* Shampoo: Ouai Detox &amp; Redken All Soft\n* Conditioner: Redken All Soft\n* Leave-in &amp; heat protectant: Redken 25-in-1 + heat protectant\n* Before diffusing: Keune Spring Loaded\n* When 60-70% dry: Umberto scrunching jelly\n* Method: S2C and rise it out completely\n* Sleeping: Pineapple hold\n\nI diffused with a claw clips yesterday near my roots and it actually worked pretty well, and my hair looked gorgeous once dry! I was really happy with it.\n\nI’m thinking maybe the products I’m using aren’t the best for this kind of weather, so if anyone has ideas, recommendations, or just general advice, I’d really appreciate it. I do live in Europe, so some products are harder to come by, convenience is a bonus.\n\n**About my hair:**\n\n* Low-medium density with medium-thick strands, so very heavy products weigh it down\n* Flat roots and curls start closer to eye level but those around my face which are layered start closer to the root.\n* Looking for some volume, but I don’t know where to start\n\nI see so many beautiful people on here with flawless curls, and I’m so envious!!\n\nAny tips, product recs, or advice would be amazing. Thank you in advance! 😊",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\nThought I’d share my 4200-graft HT journey since this sub helped me so much when I was deciding what to do.\n\nI’d been thinning pretty fast in my late 20s. My hairline was almost gone and the mid-scalp wasn’t looking great either. After months of lurking here and stalking results, I ended up going with Dr. Heena Kudyar. A few people here had mentioned her, and I liked how natural her hairline designs looked.\n\n\nConsultation:\nSuper straightforward. She checked my donor, talked honestly about what could/couldn’t be fixed, and suggested around 4200 grafts to rebuild the hairline + add density through the front and mid-scalp. No pressure, no sales pitch.\n\n\nSurgery day:\nLong day but surprisingly chill. They drew the hairline (looked way better than anything I’d tried imagining myself), numbed me up, and the extraction/implantation was smooth. I was awake the whole time and the team kept checking if I was comfortable.\n\n\nRecovery:\nFirst two weeks were the usual paranoia: “Did I sleep wrong? Did I knock a graft out? Why do I look like I got head-butted by a goat?”\nBut everything healed normally.\nResults:\n\n\nMonths 3–4: sprouts\nMonths 5–6: big jump\nBy month 9, honestly… I couldn’t believe it.\n\nMy hairline looks natural, density is way better than I expected, and people who hadn’t seen me in a while literally thought I just “changed my hairstyle.”\nZero regrets.\n\nPosting because I know how scary it is to commit to 4k+ grafts. If you’re on the fence, I get it. Feel free to ask anything—happy to help someone the way this sub helped me.",

I can't stand my acne anymore, especially being the only friend in my friend group who struggles with it. I also feel like that's the only thing stopping me from feeling pretty so it's even more hard to deal with it. my acne is on my cheeks primarily where there's a bunch of tiny bumps (fungal) and then i get 2-3 big pimples on each cheek region. I don't mind the pimples' size tbh its the redness that bothers me. so if you also have any tips to reduce the redness it would be greatly appreciated.",

I’m constantly dealing with colors going brassy which is normal with this level. Demi-permanent washes out the second or third shampoo, especially using ash tones, so guess my hair is resistant. Last product I used was Schwarzkopf Igora Vibrance with 13 volume developer. Stained my Aunts white towel over Thanksgiving because it washed out and that was only the second shampoo. \n\nI’m trying to stay away from permanent because of breakage. Perhaps you know of one that doesn’t? Before the Igora I was using SO Pure by Keune with 20 volume developer. That’s the product that caused so much breakage which surprised me. If you have recommendations on how to blend my 30-40% white and slowly make it the platinum color please let me know! I’m not ready to go white but want something different. I also am NOT willing to bleach my hair as I know from experience that it will cause too much damage. \n\nThank you!! 😊 ",

The rest of my body is completely blemish-free. I haven’t changed my shampoo, conditioner, or any other products in this time. \n\nIf this is a broken skin barrier, how should I go about fixing it?

Affordability is appreciated if possible, as I'm a uni student on a budget. Thank you so much!! ☺️\n\nRoutine:\n\nMixed Chicks Shampoo (the normal, non-clarifying one with borage seed and avocado oil, as well as sulfates) 2x a week - I shampoo my hair 1x and rinse\n\nMixed Chicks Deep Conditioner 2-3x a week - apply generously to hair, comb through, leave in for 3-4 minutes and rinse out \nNOTE: I am running out of this conditioner and am going to replace it with the Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus conditioner, same routine. I have used this conditioner before and know it works for me!\n\nI rinse my hair and comb with a wide tooth comb while wet every single day regardless of whether I'm washing it or not, and I towel dry with a scrunching motion after every shower. Daily, I use scrunching to apply: \n\nMixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner, small-medium amount \n\nAnd depending on the day, either the Mixed Chicks Curl Sculptor or the Mixed Chicks Styling Gel, small-medium amounts.\n\nI use the Olaplex Hair Oil to break up my gel cast after my hair is dry, and I shower during the morning and do not sleep with any bonnet or protective device. \n\nAll my mixed chicks products were purchased before I went to university and began my new budget - I do not have Mixed Chicks money now 😅.\n\n\n\n",

But does these breakouts actually last for these many days? \n\nWhat even is this ? It keeps coming back , and the previous one disappears. It doesn't leave that big of a mark till now. Help me identify what this is and how do I resolve it . My skin type is oily normally but now during winters it's dry. I use ponds facewash  , ponds light gel moisturizer and aqualogica pink sunscreen. \n\nI think I need spot treatment though I'm unsure what actually to use ? I'm afraid of purging as some people said it happened to them after starting actives . PLEASE HELP 😭😭😭\n\n\n(1st image is today , and the next are from the previous 25 days )",

And does the shampoo x conditioner make a difference (ex., high end products. Would switching make a difference in my hair?) \n- What’s your preferred method of drying for frizz? \n- Do you use multiple products, or just one?\n- Is there anything else I should know starting this hair-care journey?

My density is medium.\n\nFor the past year, my routine has been: \nLUS shampoo\nLUS conditioner\nLUS 3-in-1 styler.\n\nLately, I've been playing with Jessicurl (very different from LUS.)\n\nJessicurl Gentle Lather shampoo\nJessicurl Aloeba conditioner \nJessicurl Gelibration curl activator\nJessicurl Confident Coils solution\n\nNo silicones or sulfates in either brand. (They make my hair look nasty and greasy.) I apply to dripping wet hair and diffuse until mostly dry.\n\nI wear a scarf or bonnet to bed. My hair is chin length, so I dont put it up.\n\nMy issue is that it looks great on wash day, but it is - and always has been - a disaster when I wake up on Day 2. The curls are flat, or straight, or knotted, or sticking out. Frizz is often high, and sometimes the hair looks dull.\n\nThe only way I've found to deal with this is to use a spray bottle to get it back to dripping wet and start over with setting it. I dont necessarily need to apply more product. I can reactivate it with water. But the hair has to be thoroughly wet.\n\nCurl refresher doesn't have any impact on resetting my curl, nor does getting it mildly damp.\n\nI am just so tired of starting at square one every day. Maybe that's just how it goes, but I thought I'd ask whether anyone has any advice about how to refresh without starting over. ",
