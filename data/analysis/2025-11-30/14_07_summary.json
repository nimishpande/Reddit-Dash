      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Apologies in advance as this is a lot to read... Sorry.\n\nSo I have type 2c hair which is coarse and thick. It is very volumized however it is dry and brittle. I have low porosity hair, however my hair doesn't seem to ever be able to hold moisture for long. I have never used protein in my routine and have just used moisture, so I do not know whether or not I should try using protein, as no matter how much moisture I add it doesn't look great. But on the other hand, my hair fits the symptoms of hair that lacks moisture - its volumized, dry, brittle and hard. I also do not know whether or not I should use lightweight or heavyweight products on my hair (when I say products, I mean leave in conditioner and regular conditioner as I do not use curl cream/gel etc.), because I always used lightweight products as I thought it was to do with your hair type - wavy = lightweight, curly = heavyweight etc. - however since realizing my hair is coarse, I do not know if that should mean I use heavyweight products or not. \n\nMaybe the main point I have always been confused on - before ever starting a proper routine was when my hair looked the best. It was more volumized, thick and just looked healthy. But now I feel as if there's no point dropping everything in my routine because I have spent so much money on it all, and it is probably a singular thing that is causing this problem of my hair being damaged no matter what I do.\n\nTo provide context: I recently buzzed my hair to restart from the damage, however I was confused why it was even damaged in the first place as I had followed what I thought was a good routine (will list what I did in next para). My hair is in the process of growing out again, and although it is not noticeably super damaged yet some of my friends have pointed out how it looks \"dry and brittle\" up close. I am not exactly sure what type of damage I have, however I would love some clarity if possible (from the attatched pics). My hair has always been dry and flaky.  Also recently been using a medicated shampoo to help with my scalp condition I won't mention as it is against the rules of the sub.  \n  \nIn my old routine, I shampoo and conditioned twice a week, deep conditioned every other week, clarified every 3 weeks, used a leave in conditioner, rosemary oil, and argon oil after hair had dried. I also only used As I am products and the Camille Rose Conditioner. I never used any styling techniques and just let my hair air dry - patted with a cotton t shirt first though.  \nSince growing out the buzz, I have swapped out the Camille Rose conditioner for Innersense pure inspiration daily conditioner, which is a lightweight conditioner, however it seemed to work well on my hair, but the next day it was looking not great (Pic provided of it). That could also be down to the fact I am using a very stripping shampoo atm (I have to keep using that for now at least, however feel free to suggest changes for everything else). Also as I am writing this I have noticed that my bedhead feels softer looks somewhat more healthier then, say, day 2 of my routine - although day 1 always looks quite nice. \n\nAlso when thinking about the root of my problem, here is what is going through my mind right now, please tell me if any of these are the issue or if they're irrelevant to the issue:  \nLack of protein  \nProducts are too light and don't moisturize my hair enough  \nMy water is hard water  \n  \nSo to summarize my questions:\n\nShould I start using protein in my routine (if so how much, any product recs?)  \nShould I use heavier products?  \nWhat type of damage did I have and what was the cause of it?  \nAnd finally please advise me with what in my routine to change, I have a bit of a budget so go crazy lol  \n\n\nThanks!!",

Due to this facial hair issue, I missed out on wearing lipsticks but now I want to give a try to lipsticks. I used Staze 9to9 3 in 1 Caramel rose shade but they weren't looking good\n\nPlease suggest some good lipstick and lipliner shades which will suit me and if possible can anyone help me in guessing my foundation shade from my picture. I guess I'm a olive undertone person.\n\nAnother query was about skincare.\n What products to use for the dark areas around the mouth and pigmented lips? \n\n Thank you in advance!!",

My goal was simple: **make skincare easy and science-based for everyone**.\n\nI built it because skincare can feel overwhelming. There are thousands of products, conflicting advice, and lots of myths. I wanted a tool that helps people build routines that actually make sense for their skin.\n\nHere’s what Skinfem can do:\n\n* **Generate personalized routines** based on your skin type and concerns\n* **Provide an ingredient guide** so you understand what you’re putting on your skin\n* **Blog with science-backed skincare articles**\n* **Product reviews with honest comments**, so you can see what works without bias\n* **Community forum** to share your journey and ask skincare questions\n\nI’d love for anyone interested to try it out and give feedback. My main goal is to create something genuinely useful for people who care about their skin.\n\nCheck it out here: [skinfem.com](https://skinfem.com)\n\nAnd if anyone has suggestions on features or improvements, I’d love to hear them!",

Recently my skin started flaking and peeling, the new skin underneath looks red, and there is white flaky dust near. It stings and burns to the touch and even when I apply my moisturizer (Avène Hydrance Light) or cleanse (with Beauty of Joseon Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser)\n\nI have stopped both tretinoin and azelaic acid and I am trying to let my skin barrier recover, but Avène Light feels too light for this. I am thinking about a heavier reparative moisturizer like Cicaplast Baume B5 but I am not sure. Also my cleanser should not sting so I am considering changing that as well.\n\nCan you recommend specific gentle repair oriented moisturizers and gentle cleansers that are available in Europe? I would appreciate specific brand and model recommendations , and any immediate care tips to calm and repair the barrier.",

I do not get spots easily and none at all on my face.my body can feel greasy though as well as greasy eyelids.\n\nIs it worth changing my products to fragrance free? \n\nI have noticed that since using fragrance free stuff my skin is alot better and less blotchy.

The rest of my face is perfectly clear, not even a blackhead or something.\n\nI was on Accutane twice (a year in total), however only 5mg/day as my acne was not that bad. It disappeared while on Accutane almost immediately and I had the most perfect skin.\n\nAfter coming off, it came back at around 4 months. My derm won‘t put me on it again without birth control and that‘s something I absolutely don’t want, as I struggled before meanwhile/after taking it.\n\nI have tried Spironolactone in the past, it didn‘t fix my forehead and only messed with my period.\n\nI am absolutely devastated as is it always my forehead. I have bumps which are also getting inflamed and a lot of texture.\n\nI have sensitive skin with an easily destroyed skin barrier, therefore I‘m trying not to strip it more as I get more breakouts.\n\nAdapalene and bensoyl peroxide have irritated my skin.\n\nMy current routine:\n\nAM -cleansing with water only -Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoulle -The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factor Beta Glucan -La Roche Posay Anthelios SPF (I already tried it without for a couple weeks as I suspected it breaks me out but no improvement)\n\nPM -Micellar Water and Gel Cleanser afterwards -Skin 1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoulle -The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factor Beta Glucan -1x a week The Ordinary Mandelic Acid - however I am not consistant enough as I‘m always insecure about destroying my skin even more.\n\nI am avoiding dairy and eating healthy, I don‘t drink or smoke. Period is regular too.\n\nDo you have any advice for me? I am clueless about what to do.\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": " have some sort of wild mix of 2a-2c hair. Sometimes I get really cute wrapped curls, other times it loose and frizzy. Most of the time it’s a mix of both. I would love some advice on how to make it more consistently lean into the more wrapped/defined curls.\n\nI believe I have medium porosity hair, as water does bead up some when first getting it wet. Takes a good couple minutes to get it fully soaked. Here are the products / routine I am using currently.\n\nI am washing my hair every 3-4 days depending on what’s going on/ how it’s looking.\n\nStep 1- Get in the shower, soak my hair and use a light detangling spray. Currently using the Marc Anthony Grow Long spray. Brush out my hair completely with a denman type wet brush.\n\nStep 2- Shampoo and condition hair. I was using the Kristin Ess curly S &amp; C, but recently just switched to Rizos Curl Biotin S&amp;C\n\nStep 3- Still in the shower, apply Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Cury Envy Cream. Brush through my hair, and then while under the water scrunch my hair with a bit more cream in my hands.\n\nStep 4- Get out of the shower, get dressed, and scrunch some of the excess water out of my hair with a micro fiber towel.\n\nStep 5- Prayer hands apply Cantù Wave Whip Curling Mousse. Scrunch in if needed but usually try to avoid that.\n\nI do not do any diffusing / drying of my hair, which I know I’ll get some flack about. But I’m a working mom of 2 and never have the time to do it given how thick my hair is.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions on what I could do differently without adding a ton of extra time to my routine that would be amazing. Open to product recommendations or answering questions to help determine what I should do.",
