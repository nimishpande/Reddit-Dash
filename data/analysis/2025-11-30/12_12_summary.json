      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

My goal was simple: **make skincare easy and science-based for everyone**.\n\nI built it because skincare can feel overwhelming. There are thousands of products, conflicting advice, and lots of myths. I wanted a tool that helps people build routines that actually make sense for their skin.\n\nHere’s what Skinfem can do:\n\n* **Generate personalized routines** based on your skin type and concerns\n* **Provide an ingredient guide** so you understand what you’re putting on your skin\n* **Blog with science-backed skincare articles**\n* **Product reviews with honest comments**, so you can see what works without bias\n* **Community forum** to share your journey and ask skincare questions\n\nI’d love for anyone interested to try it out and give feedback. My main goal is to create something genuinely useful for people who care about their skin.\n\nCheck it out here: [skinfem.com](https://skinfem.com)\n\nAnd if anyone has suggestions on features or improvements, I’d love to hear them!",

      "title": "[Acne] Hive-like spots, rashes, and more",
      "content": "Hi all,\nI am coming to Reddit in hopes that someone has gone through what I am or has some insight.\n\nI [F21] have always had acne &amp; bad skin, probably started around 11 years old and has stuck with me since. I have been to many dermatologists over the years and been prescribed many different things. Ultimately, nothing has *really, truly worked*. I have finally gotten my skin in a decent place this past year after a lot of trial and error. I still get break outs and texture/roughness is still a problem most of the time, but nothing compared to 2-3 years ago. \nCurrently, I am using the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser at night (I find if I cleanse 2x a day, I will immediately start breaking out), followed up with a Medicube Zero Pore Pad (2-3x a week), Tir Tir Milk Toner, and Cetaphil Hydrating Facial Lotion. \nThis routine has worked well for me for almost a year now, and definitely helps the overall appearance and texture of my skin while *mostly* limiting breakouts. I only wear makeup 2x a week when I’m bartending on weekends (I’m a full-time student), I keep my hair off my face majority of the time, and I drink lots of water.\nOver the past 3-4 weeks, I have had some concerning full-body itchiness. I found at first it was mostly just on the sides of my torso. It’s getting to be winter where I am so I chalked it up to being dry skin and started moisturizing more (with a scent-free lotion of course). Within a few days, it got progressively worse, but only after a shower. By the time 5 mins has passed in the shower, my full back, chest, lower stomach, and sides are COVERED in hives. The hives are red, raised, and my skin looks splotchy and VERY ITCHY for about an hour or so after I shower before it gradually eases. \nMy first thought was allergies, however I have changed NOTHING in my personal hygiene routine for YEARS other than my facial skin care. I use mostly unscented products, like body washes and laundry detergent, and I would say I’m a hygienic person. I immediately began “experimenting”- I turned my shower water to cold at the end of a shower and rinsed off really well (still got hives), I showered in completely cold water (still got hives), and I showered without using any products at all, just rinsing off in the water (guess what, still got hives). It’s been about 3 weeks now, and I still get intense hives when I shower. \nNow, my issue is becoming worse because I think I am having a similar issue with my facial skin. I tend not to rinse my face in the shower (I prefer to do this over the skin in the evening) as I find my skin gets way too dry), so I just assumed my face was unaffected because whatever is irritating the rest of my body isn’t contacting my face. However, this past week, I have woken up in the mornings with large, inflamed, itchy spots &amp; bumps on my upper cheeks (1.5 inches under my eyes), my jawline, and my temples. These spots are very red, especially the ones on my cheeks, and quite itchy as well. The don’t have any typical pimple “heads” and don’t pop, they just end up going away after a few days. So far, I’ve found that hydrocolloid pimple patches make them 10x worse, oral antihistamines have zero effect, and cleansing my face seems to make it more itchy. \nSo, my first thoughts- fungal acne since it’s itchy, and: hormonal acne- because of the jaw placement of some bumps. I just truly don’t think either of those are the answers due to the other skin issues I’ve been having with the rest of my body. I also have been starting to get hives up and down my neck, nothing visibly noticeable but very bumpy to touch and itchy as hell.\nI’m inclined to think this may be autoimmune related, as I’ve had a few different reactions (eczema on inner arms, episcleritis, severe illness) the last 4 years that point to autoimmune issues but, every blood panel I do comes back all in range. I also have crazy allergies- Food-wise, I’m allergic to all nuts, chickpeas, lentils, cooked green peas/pea meal, and sunflower seeds. I also am allergic to everything outside- all animals except hogs, certain molds, dust mites, hay, snow mold, and pretty much every type of grass, tree, and pollen. The only outdoor/environmental allergies that bother me is the snow mold (when all the snow starts melting in the spring I tend to get stuffy/runny nose) and dog saliva when they lick me on sensitive skin like my neck or inner arms. \n\nI’m honestly just really exhausted of having to deal with one thing after another with my health and have nothing work &amp; nobody “get it right” when treating it. I’m really really hoping someone on here can give me some insight or suggest ways to relieve my symptoms. I am more than happy to answer any questions if I left anything important out, please ask away.\n\nTL;DR- Background of acne, allergies, and (possible) autoimmune issues. Started getting itchy all over my body a month or so ago, and that has progressed into getting full-body hives every time I shower that last up until an hourish after. Have tried antihistamines and moisturizing extra well, as well as testing to see if any of my shower products could irritating my skin. Found that even if I am just rinsing off (no products) in cool water, I still break out into hives. Now, I have issues with my face skin- itchy, hive-like lumps that aren’t pimples. What can I do? \n\n",

      "content": "Hi!\n\nI am 30 years old and pretty much struggling with forehead acne for years now. The rest of my face is perfectly clear, not even a blackhead or something.\n\nI was on Accutane twice (a year in total), however only 5mg/day as my acne was not that bad. It disappeared while on Accutane almost immediately and I had the most perfect skin.\n\nAfter coming off, it came back at around 4 months. My derm won‘t put me on it again without birth control and that‘s something I absolutely don’t want, as I struggled before meanwhile/after taking it.\n\nI have tried Spironolactone in the past, it didn‘t fix my forehead and only messed with my period.\n\nI am absolutely devastated as is it always my forehead. I have bumps which are also getting inflamed and a lot of texture.\n\nI have sensitive skin with an easily destroyed skin barrier, therefore I‘m trying not to strip it more as I get more breakouts.\n\nAdapalene and bensoyl peroxide have irritated my skin.\n\nMy current routine:\n\nAM -cleansing with water only -Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoulle -The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factor Beta Glucan -La Roche Posay Anthelios SPF (I already tried it without for a couple weeks as I suspected it breaks me out but no improvement)\n\nPM -Micellar Water and Gel Cleanser afterwards -Skin 1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoulle -The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factor Beta Glucan -1x a week The Ordinary Mandelic Acid - however I am not consistant enough as I‘m always insecure about destroying my skin even more.\n\nI am avoiding dairy and eating healthy, I don‘t drink or smoke. Period is regular too.\n\nDo you have any advice for me? I am clueless about what to do.\n\nThank you in advance!",
