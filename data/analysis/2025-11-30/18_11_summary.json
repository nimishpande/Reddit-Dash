      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I’ve tried Milku, human nature deodorant, Glycolic acid, usually my routine is after the shower I put glycolic then top it off with secret deodorant. I’ve even tried my boyfriends dove men 48 hours and I still start to smell terrible after just a couple hours. Not even sweating. Even showering thrice a day it smells. I’ve tried deodorant sprays and after 2-5 hours my Bo mixes with the deodorant. Even just lifting my armpit up my boyfriend will tell me wow you smell terrible. I am already so insecure about it. What can I do ladies ? I can’t live like this forever. And I always choose not to wear t shirts or sleeved shirts because the smell mixing with a shirt is absolutely horrendous as well. I don’t know what to do. I feel lost and embarrassed always. So so so embarrassed. No mater how much perfume or glycolic I put everyday it doesn’t go away!!! Please share what worked for any of you.  I start college in a couple of months and I’m going to have to wear shirts, I fear I wont ever get rid of this. ",

My routine is wash &amp; go, but I've been putting Aussie 3 minute miracle curls in lately but that's about it. My curls look great after a shower then they loose their bounce and I get frizzy after that. If I braid it when I go to bed I can make them last maybe 2 days.

Idk what the cause is ? At first I thought it's due to my periods maybe , but I got it a day ago , let's hope it goes away. But does these breakouts actually last for these many days? \n\nWhat even is this ? It keeps coming back , and the previous one disappears. It doesn't leave that big of a mark till now. Help me identify what this is and how do I resolve it . My skin type is oily normally but now during winters it's dry. I use ponds facewash  , ponds light gel moisturizer and aqualogica pink sunscreen. \n\nI think I need spot treatment though I'm unsure what actually to use ? I'm afraid of purging as some people said it happened to them after starting actives . PLEASE HELP 😭😭😭\n\n\n(1st image is today , and the next are from the previous 25 days )",

I'm also currently scheduled for an upcoming appointment with a dermatologist, as I might have Seborrheic Dermatitis.\n\nDue to red spots and flakes I've seen on my face, in my eyebrows, next to my nose, or in my moustache area, I try to stay clean-shaven with Schick razor blades (with skin guards) and have been staying up to date with using moisturizer. I'm unsure if my Dermatitis is due to using Clean &amp; Clear without moisturizer, or if it's a skin condition.\n\nI was recently recommended Byoma at a beauty store to use for moisturizing after I shower. I'm unsure whether to continue using that, La Roche-Posay's moisturizing cream, or both. I used La Roche today, and it feels good so far. A store employee I spoke to also recommended Vanicream and La Roche-Posay's sunscreen, so I took pictures of them for later.\n\nIs there anything I'm missing, or should I revise?

      "content": "Hello!\n\nI got copper highlights and cool-brown lowlights ~1.5 months ago. During the process, my hair was toned twice in the first session, then toned 3 more times with a neutral/ash brown to reduce some of the orange from the first session. I told my stylist I wanted something very natural and close to my virgin hair so it would grow out seamlessly with no ongoing maintenance. She reassured me that the grow-out wouldn’t be noticeable.\n\nNow that my roots are growing in, my cool ash natural colour is contrasting against the warm copper/orange tones, and I feel like the line is obvious. \n\nIs there any way to fix this at home?\n\nWould blue shampoo help soften the orange and make the line less harsh? Or should I go to a new salon and ask for a full-head tone/gloss? Would a root smudge help, or would that create more maintenance? Is the only real option to re-dye everything back to my natural colour?\n\nI included photos of my current hair (1, 2), hair after first session (3), hair after second session (4) and virgin hair colour (5). \n\nThank you for any advice and help!",

I detangle with my fingers in the shower and add in the same Curlsmith as a leave in, then Curlsmith in style shower gel that I rake and shake through as well. \n\nI love the curl definition and moisturizing of the in shower styling gel and how it accentuates my curl pattern.

My density is medium.\n\nFor the past year, my routine has been: \nLUS shampoo\nLUS conditioner\nLUS 3-in-1 styler.\n\nLately, I've been playing with Jessicurl (very different from LUS.)\n\nJessicurl Gentle Lather shampoo\nJessicurl Aloeba conditioner \nJessicurl Gelibration curl activator\nJessicurl Confident Coils solution\n\nNo silicones or sulfates in either brand. (They make my hair look nasty and greasy.) I apply to dripping wet hair and diffuse until mostly dry.\n\nI wear a scarf or bonnet to bed. My hair is chin length, so I dont put it up.\n\nMy issue is that it looks great on wash day, but it is - and always has been - a disaster when I wake up on Day 2. The curls are flat, or straight, or knotted, or sticking out. Frizz is often high, and sometimes the hair looks dull.\n\nThe only way I've found to deal with this is to use a spray bottle to get it back to dripping wet and start over with setting it. I dont necessarily need to apply more product. I can reactivate it with water. But the hair has to be thoroughly wet.\n\nCurl refresher doesn't have any impact on resetting my curl, nor does getting it mildly damp.\n\nI am just so tired of starting at square one every day. Maybe that's just how it goes, but I thought I'd ask whether anyone has any advice about how to refresh without starting over. ",

And does the shampoo x conditioner make a difference (ex., high end products. Would switching make a difference in my hair?) \n- What’s your preferred method of drying for frizz? \n- Do you use multiple products, or just one?\n- Is there anything else I should know starting this hair-care journey?

I have just started to notice, despite having quite long and somewhat healthy looking hair near my crown, that my parting is becoming a lot more exposed and it’s starting to look concerning. Like a bald patch.\n\nI already have some ED problems so Finasteride just doesn’t seem like a viable option to me. Plus I put disproportionate value on the working of my sexual organs and its effects on my happiness. Can’t help it. And I guess I’m here because I do the same with my hair.\n\nThe only permanent(?) option left is a hair transplant as Minoxidil can regrow hair but can’t stop progression. I’m fine with a hair transplant, comfortable with the idea. But I can’t find any reliable information on what to do when you still have most of your hair for now. Do you predict what you’ll lose later and pre-emptively replace those follicles? Do you just have to wait years until you look bad enough?\n\nAnyone else in my situation and fixed it? Do tell of your story.\n",

(Not all at once of course)\n\nFor context I’m a 30F with hormonal acne for at least that last 10 years and I feel like I’ve tried everything. I’ve read every article, I know how every ingredient works and I’m just tired. Tired of every new ad, brand and promise.\n\nI’ve come to realize that my skin actually seems to do better with less, clean cleanser, moisturizer &amp; spf\n\nI know that after the purge of retinol and tret comes bliss and I would be lying if I said I was patient every time I’ve started those to wait for the blissful period. However at the same time I don’t want to rely on these products forever to have clear skin.\n\nSo my question for this community is has anyone been here? Gone completely back to the basics and saw improvement? Anyone who has been a complete skincare addict now have a 3 step routine? If so what can we use for anti aging in a minimal routine?\n\nPs. Beef tallow didn’t work for me, it made my skin more dry and aggravated my breakouts. Things i actually notice that help are staying hydrated and a good sweat (working out)\n\nAlso I’m not hating on any of the above products, just personally for me, I’m tired lol\n\nLastly, what does everyone do with products they purchase that don’t work for them? This is the worst part about the addiction lol I’m drowning in expensive products that I don’t use and probably won’t - what a waste! I hate it 😢\n\nTIA 🫶🏼",

      "content": "Apologies in advance as this is a lot to read... Sorry.\n\nSo I have type 2c hair which is coarse and thick. It is very volumized however it is dry and brittle. I have low porosity hair, however my hair doesn't seem to ever be able to hold moisture for long. I have never used protein in my routine and have just used moisture, so I do not know whether or not I should try using protein, as no matter how much moisture I add it doesn't look great. But on the other hand, my hair fits the symptoms of hair that lacks moisture - its volumized, dry, brittle and hard. I also do not know whether or not I should use lightweight or heavyweight products on my hair (when I say products, I mean leave in conditioner and regular conditioner as I do not use curl cream/gel etc.), because I always used lightweight products as I thought it was to do with your hair type - wavy = lightweight, curly = heavyweight etc. - however since realizing my hair is coarse, I do not know if that should mean I use heavyweight products or not. \n\nMaybe the main point I have always been confused on - before ever starting a proper routine was when my hair looked the best. It was more volumized, thick and just looked healthy. But now I feel as if there's no point dropping everything in my routine because I have spent so much money on it all, and it is probably a singular thing that is causing this problem of my hair being damaged no matter what I do.\n\nTo provide context: I recently buzzed my hair to restart from the damage, however I was confused why it was even damaged in the first place as I had followed what I thought was a good routine (will list what I did in next para). My hair is in the process of growing out again, and although it is not noticeably super damaged yet some of my friends have pointed out how it looks \"dry and brittle\" up close. I am not exactly sure what type of damage I have, however I would love some clarity if possible (from the attatched pics). My hair has always been dry and flaky.  Also recently been using a medicated shampoo to help with my scalp condition I won't mention as it is against the rules of the sub.  \n  \nIn my old routine, I shampoo and conditioned twice a week, deep conditioned every other week, clarified every 3 weeks, used a leave in conditioner, rosemary oil, and argon oil after hair had dried. I also only used As I am products and the Camille Rose Conditioner. I never used any styling techniques and just let my hair air dry - patted with a cotton t shirt first though.  \nSince growing out the buzz, I have swapped out the Camille Rose conditioner for Innersense pure inspiration daily conditioner, which is a lightweight conditioner, however it seemed to work well on my hair, but the next day it was looking not great (Pic provided of it). That could also be down to the fact I am using a very stripping shampoo atm (I have to keep using that for now at least, however feel free to suggest changes for everything else). Also as I am writing this I have noticed that my bedhead feels softer looks somewhat more healthier then, say, day 2 of my routine - although day 1 always looks quite nice. \n\nAlso when thinking about the root of my problem, here is what is going through my mind right now, please tell me if any of these are the issue or if they're irrelevant to the issue:  \nLack of protein  \nProducts are too light and don't moisturize my hair enough  \nMy water is hard water  \n  \nSo to summarize my questions:\n\nShould I start using protein in my routine (if so how much, any product recs?)  \nShould I use heavier products?  \nWhat type of damage did I have and what was the cause of it?  \nAnd finally please advise me with what in my routine to change, I have a bit of a budget so go crazy lol  \n\n\nThanks!!",
