      "content": "* Before\n   *  So in 2019, I used to weigh around 100 kg and I was on a really bad routine of eating a lot of junk food and not working out a single hour a week. And had no information about skincare routine. I used to apply Vaseline on my face as a moisturizer and used to use really bad face washes like Garnier Acne fight etc. \n* After\n   * So, on **1 October 2020**, I started my fitness journey, and since then, have lost around **25 kg of weight.** \n   * Currently, I weigh around **75 kgs**, though I am skinny fat, but gained a lot of muscles in the last 4 to 5 months, and if everything goes well, I'll be shredded\n   * Now I follow a **minimal yet consistent skin routine**, so I use the following three items on a daily basis:\n   1. For face wash, I use a benzoyl peroxide gel cleanser\n   2. For face cream, I use an Episoft AC, which is a combination of moisturizer plus sunscreen\n   3. I also have a benzoyl peroxide gel, which I use on my pimples because even now I get a lot of pimples if I don't properly follow my skincare routine and if I eat out a lot of junk food\n\n**Things which worked for me as a person who has an acne-prone face genetically not just a teenage puberty phase.**\n\n1. Following a proper skincare routine with **cleanser**, **moisturizer** (since my moisturizer is a combination of sunscreen and moisturizer, so I don't use a separate sunscreen at least for now.) \n\n2. Working out and losing excess fat. \n\n3. Not going out in direct sun and using an umbrella as much as possible.   \n  \n **things to avoid** \n\n1. never use hard face washes that strip out all the oils from your body. Always use a very light and non-invasive face wash like Cetaphil or Benzoyl Peroxide Gel \n\n2.  if your face is very oily, always use moisturizers which are very light and don't have oils in them. Basically, you can figure this out by testing out the consistency. If the viscosity of the moisturizer is very high, then it has oil, and if it is very drain kind of, then it is oil-free.  \n  \n3. figure out your trigger points for acne. I have realized that if I eat too much sugar or eat a lot of food, then I get acne the next day, and it can be different for different people, but you must have to figure out and identify various triggers that are there in your body that cause acne ",

      "content": "I went for my first curly dry cut this week (totally worth it) and the stylist showed me how to make my hair style 100x better than it was. I don't know whether this will work for others, but here's the routine she did for me:\n\nShe began styling my hair when it was extremely wet.\n\nShe used much more product than I typically use. I have fine hair, so I always went easy on the product. She went section by section and coated that hair thoroughly. (It was a light foam for my fine hair, but could be heavier based on texture.) Each section of hair was carefully coated root to ends.\n\nShe applied some Innersense finishing spray to reduce drying time. I'm not sure all finishing sprays can be used this way - probably not - but I found several blow dry sprays on Amazon that are designed to cut dry time (e.g. Kenra,  Colorwow, Redken).\n\nShe finger combed it with a focus on creating ribboned clumps. (This was not tedious finger curling, just raking section by section to clump and ribbon the hair. She said anything that looks sloppy and haphazard while wet will become frizz when dry.\n\nOnce I had some ribboned clumps, she carefully scrunched the ribbons in her hand once, held the hair close to the head, and pulsed a few times. If you've ever \"squished to condish,\" it was just like that.\n\nShe used to diffuser for several minutes to hover over the hair and dry it a bit without touching it.\n\nOnce a cast started setting up, she gently picked up sections of the hair and put just the ends in the bowl of the diffuser. The goal was to dry the ends without disturbing the hair too much.\n\nFinally, when it was maybe 80% dry, she started to pixie dry the hair and scrunch it right up to the roots with the bowl of the diffuser. She had me tip my head to one side and then to the other to get a little volume toward the roots. She advised *not* to tip fully upside down, as it would disturb the hair too much.\n\nAt the end, she used some serum to break the cast. (I don't have serum at home, so I used a drop of LUS oil.)\n\nI've been sleeping in a bonnet at night, and my hair looks perfect the next day. The curls really hold.\n\nAll products at the salon were Innersense. I use LUS at home. ",

I am a guy that gets about 6-7h of sleep during work weeks. I work out and eat healthy (as good as i can ofcourse) and recently a girly friend of mine suggested doing skin care and how men would really benefit from doing so as most of us don't for some reason. So i picked up a gel cleanser and a moisturizer as recommended by her. But i am just stuck on the benefits of it all as i am really in it for possible health benefits for the long term not so much for acne management or anything. I did some research and apearandly i should also add a suncream to the mix. I am not in it for the beauty i am more so in it for the self care and mainly health benefits. So the question is what are the sience based benefits and does putting these things on my face do me good long term? Or wil it do me bad in the long term.\n\nAs you can probably tell i am quite lost so literaly any help would be appreciated :).",

I had been using Salicylic acid and it didn’t really help so in august I decided to start adapalene (Differin), which I had applied to much so quickly. I got off of it and stuck to niacinamide and gentle cleansers but my skin had kept getting worse. Eventually this October around the 10th I started adapalene again and its now been 2 and almost a half months of consistent use and my acne is only getting worse.\n\nMy routine is (Morning):\n\n- Gentle Cleanser (Cetaphil Hydrating Cleanser)\n- Vitamin C (Ordinary)\n- Moisturizer (Basic Cetaphil Moisturizer)\n\nNight:\n- GC (same as above)\n- Adapalene (differin)\n- Niacinamide (Ordinary 10%)\n- Moisturizer (same as above)\n\nThis has been a huge insecurity for me and I was hoping to find any help at all. I am really worried about my acne, and my hair does fall on my forehead, so that may be the cause of some of my acne. I don’t use any products in my hair anymore and was hoping for any advice or recommendations. Thank you.",

      "content": "So over the past few years, the appearance of my skin has been getting worse, and I constantly get small clogged pores under my cheekbones, which then turn into inflamed pimples. It gets worse especially during my menstrual cycle. Because of this, I’m wondering whether it could be hormonal in origin.\n\nOn the other hand, I might have also messed things up recently by using too many exfoliating products, which damaged my skin barrier. At the moment, I’ve started using a pH-neutral, gentle facial cleanser (Jelly Joker), followed by the Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner, then aloe vera gel and Snail Mucin Essence for hydration. On some evenings, I also rinsed my face with chamomile tea. Since then, my skin has calmed down a bit and I no longer get huge inflamed pimples, but I’m really bothered by the many small clogged pores, and the marks left by previous pimples (red spots) don’t seem to fade.\n\nI’ve seen others with similar acne, but I haven’t really seen what helped improve their situation. Does anyone have any useful advice or tips? Thank you!",

I do immense amount of research before buying any product like if they are fungal acne safe, have non comedogenic ingredients and are for acne prone skin. I thoroughly research and only then i buy it but still they never work. I am currently using Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel moisturiser cause my skin is dry asff and i know this moisturiser is very light but this is the only thing that is not giving me worse result otherwise every thing broke me out. I used the CeraVe moisturiser, bioderma atoderm gel moisturiser and these high brands also gave me a lot of comedones. Doctor has given me isotretinoin so i am taking it every alternate days. Using derma co 1% hyaluronic sunscreen. My skin at this point is so dull, the spots are all over my face. My face colour doesn’t even match my body colour. I feel so helpless and tired. Also now i hate to go anywhere there is good light.\n\nCan someone tell me what should i do. Should i continue with this moisturiser and sunscreen?",

I would say I am a bit below baseline, and constantly thinning through last year and still continuing to.\n\nI've been considering adding dutasteride to my routine for quite some time now, but haven't really done much research to be sure. \n\nMy plan is to add dut 2-3x to my weekly rotation, so take it \\*instead\\* of fin 2-3 days/a week. I look at fin as a more stable long-term drug that could potentially be taken for even decades, and as for dut, there is not as much research for long-term as it is new but it has really really good results for some users.\n\n\\***Now, I am simply wondering about your guys' experiences! What was your experience if any of you have done this, at any frequency, doesn't matter; just if you have combined finasteride and dutasteride; would you recommend it?**\\*  I would simply do this in hopes to stop the shedding since fin hasn't done much.
