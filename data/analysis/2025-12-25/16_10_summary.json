      "content": "* Before\n   *  So in 2019, I used to weigh around 100 kg and I was on a really bad routine of eating a lot of junk food and not working out a single hour a week. And had no information about skincare routine. I used to apply Vaseline on my face as a moisturizer and used to use really bad face washes like Garnier Acne fight etc. \n* After\n   * So, on **1 October 2020**, I started my fitness journey, and since then, have lost around **25 kg of weight.** \n   * Currently, I weigh around **75 kgs**, though I am skinny fat, but gained a lot of muscles in the last 4 to 5 months, and if everything goes well, I'll be shredded\n   * Now I follow a **minimal yet consistent skin routine**, so I use the following three items on a daily basis:\n   1. For face wash, I use a benzoyl peroxide gel cleanser\n   2. For face cream, I use an Episoft AC, which is a combination of moisturizer plus sunscreen\n   3. I also have a benzoyl peroxide gel, which I use on my pimples because even now I get a lot of pimples if I don't properly follow my skincare routine and if I eat out a lot of junk food\n\n**Things which worked for me as a person who has an acne-prone face genetically not just a teenage puberty phase.**\n\n1. Following a proper skincare routine with **cleanser**, **moisturizer** (since my moisturizer is a combination of sunscreen and moisturizer, so I don't use a separate sunscreen at least for now.) \n\n2. Working out and losing excess fat. \n\n3. Not going out in direct sun and using an umbrella as much as possible.   \n  \n **things to avoid** \n\n1. never use hard face washes that strip out all the oils from your body. Always use a very light and non-invasive face wash like Cetaphil or Benzoyl Peroxide Gel \n\n2.  if your face is very oily, always use moisturizers which are very light and don't have oils in them. Basically, you can figure this out by testing out the consistency. If the viscosity of the moisturizer is very high, then it has oil, and if it is very drain kind of, then it is oil-free.  \n  \n3. figure out your trigger points for acne. I have realized that if I eat too much sugar or eat a lot of food, then I get acne the next day, and it can be different for different people, but you must have to figure out and identify various triggers that are there in your body that cause acne ",

      "content": "I went for my first curly dry cut this week (totally worth it) and the stylist showed me how to make my hair style 100x better than it was. I don't know whether this will work for others, but here's the routine she did for me:\n\nShe began styling my hair when it was extremely wet.\n\nShe used much more product than I typically use. I have fine hair, so I always went easy on the product. She went section by section and coated that hair thoroughly. (It was a light foam for my fine hair, but could be heavier based on texture.) Each section of hair was carefully coated root to ends.\n\nShe applied some Innersense finishing spray to reduce drying time. I'm not sure all finishing sprays can be used this way - probably not - but I found several blow dry sprays on Amazon that are designed to cut dry time (e.g. Kenra,  Colorwow, Redken).\n\nShe finger combed it with a focus on creating ribboned clumps. (This was not tedious finger curling, just raking section by section to clump and ribbon the hair. She said anything that looks sloppy and haphazard while wet will become frizz when dry.\n\nOnce I had some ribboned clumps, she carefully scrunched the ribbons in her hand once, held the hair close to the head, and pulsed a few times. If you've ever \"squished to condish,\" it was just like that.\n\nShe used to diffuser for several minutes to hover over the hair and dry it a bit without touching it.\n\nOnce a cast started setting up, she gently picked up sections of the hair and put just the ends in the bowl of the diffuser. The goal was to dry the ends without disturbing the hair too much.\n\nFinally, when it was maybe 80% dry, she started to pixie dry the hair and scrunch it right up to the roots with the bowl of the diffuser. She had me tip my head to one side and then to the other to get a little volume toward the roots. She advised *not* to tip fully upside down, as it would disturb the hair too much.\n\nAt the end, she used some serum to break the cast. (I don't have serum at home, so I used a drop of LUS oil.)\n\nI've been sleeping in a bonnet at night, and my hair looks perfect the next day. The curls really hold.\n\nAll products at the salon were Innersense. I use LUS at home. ",

I don’t want to become just another sunscreen brand or get lost in the noise.\n\nSo I’d love your honest input as a customer:\n\n* Are there any products you wish existed but are hard to find in India?\n* Any ingredients you feel are missing, too expensive, or not effective enough in current brands?\n* What are your real skin concerns that brands don’t solve properly?\n* Which category are you more likely to spend on: face care, body care, hair care, or something else-and why?\n\nI’m also trying to answer one big question:  \nWhy would a customer choose my brand over big, established players?\n\nFrom your perspective, should a new brand:\n\n* Focus on problem-solving, result-driven products, or\n* Launch attractive, hype-based products (like viral masks or trends)?\n\nAny suggestions-product ideas, gaps you notice, pricing pain points, or even things you’re tired of seeing-would help a lot.\n\nThink of this as advice to a founder from a customer.  \nI’m here to listen. 🙏",

I am a guy that gets about 6-7h of sleep during work weeks. I work out and eat healthy (as good as i can ofcourse) and recently a girly friend of mine suggested doing skin care and how men would really benefit from doing so as most of us don't for some reason. So i picked up a gel cleanser and a moisturizer as recommended by her. But i am just stuck on the benefits of it all as i am really in it for possible health benefits for the long term not so much for acne management or anything. I did some research and apearandly i should also add a suncream to the mix. I am not in it for the beauty i am more so in it for the self care and mainly health benefits. So the question is what are the sience based benefits and does putting these things on my face do me good long term? Or wil it do me bad in the long term.\n\nAs you can probably tell i am quite lost so literaly any help would be appreciated :).",

I had been using Salicylic acid and it didn’t really help so in august I decided to start adapalene (Differin), which I had applied to much so quickly. I got off of it and stuck to niacinamide and gentle cleansers but my skin had kept getting worse. Eventually this October around the 10th I started adapalene again and its now been 2 and almost a half months of consistent use and my acne is only getting worse.\n\nMy routine is (Morning):\n\n- Gentle Cleanser (Cetaphil Hydrating Cleanser)\n- Vitamin C (Ordinary)\n- Moisturizer (Basic Cetaphil Moisturizer)\n\nNight:\n- GC (same as above)\n- Adapalene (differin)\n- Niacinamide (Ordinary 10%)\n- Moisturizer (same as above)\n\nThis has been a huge insecurity for me and I was hoping to find any help at all. I am really worried about my acne, and my hair does fall on my forehead, so that may be the cause of some of my acne. I don’t use any products in my hair anymore and was hoping for any advice or recommendations. Thank you.",

I don’t want to become just another sunscreen brand or get lost in the noise.\n\nSo I’d love your honest input as a customer:\n\n* Are there any products you wish existed but are hard to find in India?\n* Any ingredients you feel are missing, too expensive, or not effective enough in current brands?\n* What are your real skin concerns that brands don’t solve properly?\n* Which category are you more likely to spend on: face care, body care, hair care, or something else-and why?\n\nI’m also trying to answer one big question:  \nWhy would a customer choose my brand over big, established players?\n\nFrom your perspective, should a new brand:\n\n* Focus on problem-solving, result-driven products, or\n* Launch attractive, hype-based products (like viral masks or trends)?\n\nAny suggestions-product ideas, gaps you notice, pricing pain points, or even things you’re tired of seeing-would help a lot.\n\nThink of this as advice to a founder from a customer.  \nI’m here to listen. 🙏",

I've had blackheads for 5 years that don’t go away no matter what I use. I have stretch marks on my thighs where I don’t have a fucking clue how they got there cause I haven’t lost or gained wait in ages and I'm not even 20 yet. My legs have lots of little spots on them, which I think is called strawberry legs.\n\nEverything is so confusing. I don’t even know where or how to start. I don't know what stuff is best for my skin and I'm scared to just try something out incase it makes my skin worse. There are so so so many different cremes and such that say they'll clear it all up really fast and it'll be absolutely dandy but I don’t know if it's true or not. Everything is so expensive and I can't afford anything.\n\nI know that sunscreen is really important for the skin but I really hate using it. It always makes me look even paler than usual, my skin is sticky for days (even after showering and scrubbing like crazy) and I can't stand the feeling of rubbing it in. And the smell is way too strong.\n\nWhenever I search what a good routine would be, the routines are always really long. Again, I can't afford so much stuff but I also don’t have the time or energy to do all that because I'm chronically ill.\n\nI don’t know anybody who I could go to and ask lots of questions about skincare. My only friend isn’t interested in this stuff and my mother doesn’t know anything about this either.\n\nMy current routine: On alternating days I either use African black soap (cuz I know that can dry the skin) or just water to clean my face. Then I use an aknederm creme that has really helped with my acne and fades everything a little bit. Every three days I exfoliate with a tea tree oil facial scrub. The soap has been really good so far.\n\nSo to sum it all up: I'm broke, confused and in desperate need of advice. ",

      "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore anyone jumps in with “confidence is attractive” or “personality matters,” let me stop you right there. Yes, people like me. I make friends easily. I’m respected at work. People enjoy talking to me, hanging out with me, opening up to me. I’m treated well as a human being. But love? Desire? Romantic interest? That’s where the story changes. Being a man is never easy.\n\nBecause I don’t fit the Indian beauty standard for men.\n\nI don’t have that “clean,” “bright,” “presentable” look our society is obsessed with. No matter how well I dress or groom myself, how articulate I am, my skin tone quietly disqualifies me before my personality even gets a chance. It’s always subtle, never openly cruel but it’s there. You can feel it in the hesitation, the polite rejection, the “you are such a nice guy” energy.\n\nDating apps make this even worse. Swipe culture reduces you to a photo, and Indian swipe culture reduces you further to skin tone. You can literally feel that people appreciate you but don’t want you. They will talk, laugh and they will say that you are amazing, then choose someone lighter without a second thought.\n\nWhat hurts the most is that I actually like who I am. I have worked on myself. I’m confident without being arrogant. I’m emotionally aware. I’m stable. I know I’d be a good partner. I don’t hate myself. I just hate that society keeps telling me indirectly, that I’m lovable but not desirable.\n\nAnd no, this isn’t about wanting validation from everyone. I just wish someone would love me for who I am, without subconsciously wishing I looked different. I wish attraction wasn’t so tightly tied to colonial hangovers and fairness ads disguised as “preferences.”\n\nI’m tired of pretending this doesn’t affect me. It does. You can be strong and still feel unwanted. You can be confident and still wish, quietly, that someone chose you without compromise.\n\nI don’t want to be everyone’s favorite friend. I want to be someone’s first choice.\n\nThat’s it. That’s the rant. Thank you for reading. I wish I had someone in my life but it seems like a far fetched dream. I wish someone talks to me or love me at least",

      "content": "So over the past few years, the appearance of my skin has been getting worse, and I constantly get small clogged pores under my cheekbones, which then turn into inflamed pimples. It gets worse especially during my menstrual cycle. Because of this, I’m wondering whether it could be hormonal in origin.\n\nOn the other hand, I might have also messed things up recently by using too many exfoliating products, which damaged my skin barrier. At the moment, I’ve started using a pH-neutral, gentle facial cleanser (Jelly Joker), followed by the Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner, then aloe vera gel and Snail Mucin Essence for hydration. On some evenings, I also rinsed my face with chamomile tea. Since then, my skin has calmed down a bit and I no longer get huge inflamed pimples, but I’m really bothered by the many small clogged pores, and the marks left by previous pimples (red spots) don’t seem to fade.\n\nI’ve seen others with similar acne, but I haven’t really seen what helped improve their situation. Does anyone have any useful advice or tips? Thank you!",
