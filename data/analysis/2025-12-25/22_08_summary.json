      "content": "I went for my first curly dry cut this week (totally worth it) and the stylist showed me how to make my hair style 100x better than it was. I don't know whether this will work for others, but here's the routine she did for me:\n\nShe began styling my hair when it was extremely wet.\n\nShe used much more product than I typically use. I have fine hair, so I always went easy on the product. She went section by section and coated that hair thoroughly. (It was a light foam for my fine hair, but could be heavier based on texture.) Each section of hair was carefully coated root to ends.\n\nShe applied some Innersense finishing spray to reduce drying time. I'm not sure all finishing sprays can be used this way - probably not - but I found several blow dry sprays on Amazon that are designed to cut dry time (e.g. Kenra,  Colorwow, Redken).\n\nShe finger combed it with a focus on creating ribboned clumps. (This was not tedious finger curling, just raking section by section to clump and ribbon the hair. She said anything that looks sloppy and haphazard while wet will become frizz when dry.\n\nOnce I had some ribboned clumps, she carefully scrunched the ribbons in her hand once, held the hair close to the head, and pulsed a few times. If you've ever \"squished to condish,\" it was just like that.\n\nShe used to diffuser for several minutes to hover over the hair and dry it a bit without touching it.\n\nOnce a cast started setting up, she gently picked up sections of the hair and put just the ends in the bowl of the diffuser. The goal was to dry the ends without disturbing the hair too much.\n\nFinally, when it was maybe 80% dry, she started to pixie dry the hair and scrunch it right up to the roots with the bowl of the diffuser. She had me tip my head to one side and then to the other to get a little volume toward the roots. She advised *not* to tip fully upside down, as it would disturb the hair too much.\n\nAt the end, she used some serum to break the cast. (I don't have serum at home, so I used a drop of LUS oil.)\n\nI've been sleeping in a bonnet at night, and my hair looks perfect the next day. The curls really hold.\n\nAll products at the salon were Innersense. I use LUS at home. ",

Then put it on my hair section by section - for some weird reason the product seems to \"suck out \" hydration from my hair ? Rather than lock it in? Idk.\n\nThen I apply the I create hold gel - same way, rub it between my palms with some water and apply. With water I scrunch up my hair to encourage curl definition and use a brush to brush my hair into clumps. Then I plop using a  cotton T shirt and let the excess water get absorbed. Then I diffuse to 90 to dry.\n\nI'm just not happy with the results and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. My hair has gotten more dry and brittle with these two products - I can feel that as it dries. It doesn't feel hydrated ,in fact I feel Innersense producta seem to \"suck\" water out of my hair. So weird for a hyped product. \n\nWhat can I do to rectify? Are their better affordable products that help lock in moisture?\n\nIs it a moisture problem really? Attaching pics for reference.

Since then I've lived and grown up in a western european country. The country has a lot of expats and international students so I see a lot of other east asian women who grew up in the east. I also know otuer chinese adoptees that grew up in the west.\n\nWhat I have noticed is that (basically) all the east asian women I've seen and met in the west who grew up in the east have seemingly achieved glass skin, like it always looks a little shiny, even if they have pimples or rough patches. The chinese girls who grew up in the west, including myself, have all more dull looking skin, like other other western people. I've been wondering, does it have to do with diet, skincare, combination or something completely different? \n\n",

      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* **Holy Grails:** Minimalist SA Cleanser, Minimalist B12 Moisturiser, Minimalist Light Fluid Sunscreen, Cicaplast Baume B5+, Laneige Lip Mask, Minimalist Ceramides 0.3% + Madecassoside Moisturiser\n* **Will Repurchase:** Everything except the eye cream\n* **Will Not Repurchase:** The Derma Co Eye Cream\n\nSome products here contain denatured alcohol. My skin tolerates them well, but I avoid such formulations around my eyelids.\n\n \n\n# About me:\n\n29, combination skin (mostly dry with an oily T-zone). Acne-prone with noticeable Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, especially from adult acne that started in my late 20s. My skin isn’t barrier-damaged and can generally tolerate different products. My eyelids are very sensitive and can peel and dry out easily. I am also on a low dose oral isotretinoin treatment right now, so absolutely no topical Retinoids in my routine. I live in a city with hot weather most of the year and fairly humid.\n\n \n\n# AM ROUTINE\n\n**1. Cleanser**\n\n**Minimalist Salicylic Acid + LHA Cleanser (0.2%)**\n\nBeen using this for years at this point. I am so glad they are selling it in a larger size now. Gel-based, non-stripping cleanser with no fragrance. Keeps acne in check without drying out my cheeks. Works well even with daily use.\n\nVerdict: **Holy Grail. Will Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**2. Toner**\n\n**Minimalist Vitamin B12 + NMF Toner**\n\nSlightly thicker in consistency compared to your average toner with no fragrance. It is not watery or runny. It is a new launch, hence based on the couple of weeks I’ve used, it is very hydrating and calming. Makes my skin feel plump without any stickiness. Early days, but first impressions are excellent.\n\nVerdict: **Will Repurchase**\n\n \n\n**3. Serum**\n\n**Eucerin Anti-Pigment Dual Serum (with patented Thiamidol)**\n\nLets start by saying that this serum is EXPENSIVE. Its MRP is Rs. 3780 but I managed to buy it during a sale (still expensive). Did quite a bit of research before buying this. I was confused between the “La Roche-Posay Mela B3 Serum” and this one. I was looking for new age ingredients for pigmentation. Did a lot of comparison between the patented ingredients - Melasyl &amp; Thiamidol. I went ahead with Thiamidol because it has more clinical studies. It is a lightweight serum and has a very noticeable fragrance (which I don’t mind if it can do its job). Slow but noticeable improvement in pigmentation. Not drying despite having denatured alcohol, but I avoid using it on my eyelids. Too early to call HG but promising so far.\n\nVerdict: **Will Repurchase (tentatively)**\n\n \n\n**4. Moisturiser**\n\n**Minimalist B12 + Repair Complex 5.5% Moisturiser**\n\nFeels slightly thick initially but spreads and absorbs beautifully. It has no fragrance and is pink in colour, but I see no hue on my face once it gets absorbed. It is lightweight yet nourishing and soothes irritation.\n\nVerdict: **Holy Grail. Will Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**5. Sunscreen (one of the three depending on the day and my mood)**\n\n**Minimalist Light Fluid SPF 50 PA++++**\n\nIt is a lightweight, fluid sunscreen with no fragrance. My go-to sunscreen all year round and I have been using this for a long time now. Comfortable, no heaviness, and gentle enough for my eyelids, which are sensitive. Provides good sun protection and probably my favourite Indian sunscreen. I have never experienced pilling with this product.\n\nVerdict: **Holy Grail. Will Repurchase. Permanent place in my shelf.**\n\n \n\n**La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMUNE400 Anti-Dark Spot Fluid SPF50+ Sunscreen with Melasyl**\n\nIt has a Fluid with a smooth finish, but it can feel heavy. I enjoy using this in winter when the weather is more forgiving. However, it stings my eyelids (I guess due to denatured alcohol), so I avoid that area and stick to my Minimalist sunscreen for eyelids all the time. It is pricey but a very good product with excellent sun protection and no pilling.\n\nVerdict: **Will Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Spray SPF 50+**\n\nPurchased this from a pharmacy is France. Available in India from some websites. I use it mainly for body and exposed areas like hands and feet. Very similar to the UVMUNE 400 if function and feel. This is pricey and I purchased it only because I got a very good deal (5 euros).\n\nVerdict: **Repurchase possibility is less. Will Repurchase only if there is a good deal.**\n\n \n\n**6. Lip Balm**\n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask (Berry)**\n\nAbsolute game changer for my lips. Deeply nourishing and keeps them soft for hours. Nothing has worked as well as this lip balm. It’s more expensive than the typical lip balm but totally worth it. Has a pleasant fragrance which I personally enjoy.\n\nVerdict: **Holy Grail. Will Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n# PM ROUTINE\n\n**1a. Balm Cleanse**\n\n**Deconstruct Soothing Cleansing Balm**\n\nBalm texture that emulsifies well and has no fragrance. Been using this for ages. Removes sunscreen and makeup gently without drying out my skin. Does its job well while being gentle on the skin. It’s almost always on discount so it is a good deal as well.\n\nVerdict: **Will Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**1b. Cleanser**\n\n**Minimalist Salicylic Acid + LHA Cleanser**\n\n \n\n**2. Toner**\n\n**Minimalist Vitamin B12 + NMF Toner**\n\n \n\n**3. Serum**\n\n**Eucerin Anti-Pigment Dual Serum**\n\n \n\n**4. Eye Cream**\n\n**The Derma Co Snail Peptide 96 Under Eye Repair Cream**\n\nI’m not convinced it does much. Planning to stop and just moisturise my under-eye area instead. Too many steps tend to put me off consistency as well.\n\nVerdict: **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**5. Moisturiser &amp; Barrier Care**\n\n**Minimalist B12 + Repair Complex Moisturiser**\n\n(Same thoughts as AM)\n\n \n\n**La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+**\n\nHoly grail for sensitive areas, especially eyelids. A bit heavy for summer but amazing in winter as a sealant and calming balm. I wish I tried this sooner. The price was off putting but it is absolutely worth it. Initially got this at a great discount but I don’t mind paying the pricing mentioned in Nykaa.\n\nVerdict: **Holy Grail. Will Repurchase. Permanent place in my shelf.**\n\n \n\n**6. Lip Balm**\n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask**  \n(Same thoughts as AM)\n\n \n\n# OTHER / OCCASIONAL PRODUCTS\n\n**Exfoliant (Monthly)**\n\n**Minimalist Glycolic Acid 8% Exfoliating Liquid**\n\nUsed once or twice a month, depending on how my skin feels. Gentle yet effective. Doesn’t feel harsh and works well even for skin that leans dry. Also, more economical than The Ordinary one. Definitely something I’ll keep repurchasing because it does improve skin texture while note being too stingy or harsh.\n\nVerdict: **Will Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**Clay Mask (Weekly)**\n\n**Foxtale Skin Radiance Mask**\n\nUsed weekly or as needed. A standard clay mask. Does what most clay masks do like helping with congestion and pore cleansing, but nothing standout. If you find a cheaper alternative, you’re not missing out by switching. Decent enough, but I’m open to trying other options.\n\nVerdict: **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**Powder Cleanser (Occasional)**\n\n**TIRTIR Hydro Boost Enzyme Powder Wash**\n\nOccasional use. Cleanses very well and leaves the skin feeling extremely smooth. A little goes a long way, so it lasts forever. That said, it’s pricier than regular cleansers, and I’m too comfortable with my existing ones to justify repurchasing. Nice, but not essential. But a unique product.\n\nVerdict: **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n \n\n**Moisturiser (Backup HG)**\n\n**Minimalist Ceramides 0.3% + Madecassoside Moisturiser**\n\nI’ve been using this since 2022; I’m not using it daily at the moment only because I’m enjoying other moisturisers and don’t want my routine to feel too heavy. Gone through countless tubes of this product. Whenever I want that glazed donut, deeply moisturised feel, I reach for this. It will always have a place in my routine.\n\nVerdict: **Holy Grail. Will Repurchase. Permanent place in my shelf.**",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore anyone jumps in with “confidence is attractive” or “personality matters,” let me stop you right there. Yes, people like me. I make friends easily. I’m respected at work. People enjoy talking to me, hanging out with me, opening up to me. I’m treated well as a human being. But love? Desire? Romantic interest? That’s where the story changes. Being a man is never easy.\n\nBecause I don’t fit the Indian beauty standard for men.\n\nI don’t have that “clean,” “bright,” “presentable” look our society is obsessed with. No matter how well I dress or groom myself, how articulate I am, my skin tone quietly disqualifies me before my personality even gets a chance. It’s always subtle, never openly cruel but it’s there. You can feel it in the hesitation, the polite rejection, the “you are such a nice guy” energy.\n\nDating apps make this even worse. Swipe culture reduces you to a photo, and Indian swipe culture reduces you further to skin tone. You can literally feel that people appreciate you but don’t want you. They will talk, laugh and they will say that you are amazing, then choose someone lighter without a second thought.\n\nWhat hurts the most is that I actually like who I am. I have worked on myself. I’m confident without being arrogant. I’m emotionally aware. I’m stable. I know I’d be a good partner. I don’t hate myself. I just hate that society keeps telling me indirectly, that I’m lovable but not desirable.\n\nAnd no, this isn’t about wanting validation from everyone. I just wish someone would love me for who I am, without subconsciously wishing I looked different. I wish attraction wasn’t so tightly tied to colonial hangovers and fairness ads disguised as “preferences.”\n\nI’m tired of pretending this doesn’t affect me. It does. You can be strong and still feel unwanted. You can be confident and still wish, quietly, that someone chose you without compromise.\n\nI don’t want to be everyone’s favorite friend. I want to be someone’s first choice.\n\nThat’s it. That’s the rant. Thank you for reading. I wish I had someone in my life but it seems like a far fetched dream. I wish someone talks to me or love me at least",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m torn about whether I should go back to my natural hair color. I’ve bleached my hair over time, which caused major length loss, breakage, and constant fear of hair snapping when brushing.\n\nI really want reddish-copper tones, but I’m worried about further damage and whether it would suit me. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would going back to a more natural color be safer, or can I safely get the reddish-copper look without worsening my hair condition?\n\nMy priorities:\n\n\t•\tLess breakage\n\n\t•\tFuller, healthier-looking hair\n\n\t•\tA color that complements me\n\nThank you❤️❤️",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Photos 1, 2, 3, 4: From today. A decent hair day, where I styled my hair with kinky curly knot today leave in. aussie instant freeze gel, and diffused it. Not the BEST hair day I’ve had, but good. Also showing it in the bun that I like to wear.\n\nPhoto 5: The other day. Styled my hair, but you can see how dry and wispy it can look.\n\nPhotos 6, 7(😛): Hair without products or styling, air dried. VERY soft and fine and loose waves, but the next day without products, it is nearly straight, and very flat and limp, hence why I need to often style with gel.\n\nPhoto 8: Another day without products… you can see how thin my ends are. I hate how I can see my back THROUGH my hair!!!\n\nPhoto 9: An example styled of how curly my hair can get at this length when styled well, but also the thinness of the ends. \n\nPhotos 10, 11, 12: Hair when it was short with choppy layers. I loved the bounce, fullness and curl. I feel it looks healthiest here, ans maybe I could have done more style wise (updos with small claw clips, etc? at the time to scratch the itch I have to put it up lol)\n\nPhoto 13: Kind of in between. Grown out from the short hair of the previous photos, but still not even touching my shoulders. Love this length also. \n\nHonestly, I’m just very tired of attempting to grow my hair out and I’m about to give up, book a hair appointment, and get it cut back to a short bob. I LOVED my short bob, anywhere between chin length to just above shoulders, my hair is curly, bouncy and full. I’ve been attempting to grow my hair out for a year or so at this point, with 2-3 small trims in 2025. But as its gotten to collar length, it just gets SO wispy. My hair doesn’t curl like it did, and even good hair days are mainly flocked with rough ones. My ends get thin and wispy no matter what, I hate that I can see through them. My hair grows very slow, and I’m starting to wonder if this is even worth it. Sure, I love the look of long wavy hair, but even if I get there, it won’t be thick and lucsious. I’m already getting frustrated with the increased need for product, upkeep, how dry it gets, and the main things tethering me to keep on trying is the idea that I just need to “push through” the wispiness at this length so the fuller hair can catch up, AND that I love that I can put it in a messy updo finally… but again, is it worth it if I end up crying at how thin it looks most days? My hair has looked visually very much similar over the last year despite growth, you can go back and check my post from a bunch of months ago. \n\nI guess I’m just asking, does this even seem worth it for me? I was happier with short hair, but I also yearn for long hair, but frankly, I KNOW its a huge time commitment, energy commitment, etc etc that maybe I just don’t have. I dont even know what I’d do if it did get long - I don’t know how to braid, I know I won’t want to learn elaborate hairstyles or oil anyway. I just feel conflicted bc I keep getting pulled in by yayy messy bun!! Urghh i dont know what to do, I wish my hair wasn’t so fine and wispy and fragile!!😭\n\nMy CURRENT hair routine:\n\n\\- Wash and condition with herbal essence grapefruit shampoo and chamomile conditioner\n\n\\- Glaze and scrunch in kinky curly knot today leave in conditioner in shower\n\n\\- Out of shower, I lightly scrunch out excess water and glaze and scrunch in big quarter sized globs of aussie instant freeze gel\n\n\\- Scrunch hair and plop with microfiber headwrap\n\n\\- Remove wrap after I get dressed, add two more dime sized amounts of gel\n\n\\- Hover Diffuse on high heat high speed till cast forms, then low heat high speed diffuse by cupping my hair into sections\n\n\\- Scrunch out crunch and fluff. My routine has been very similar with random experimentations throughout the years, but it usually always comes back to this. \n\nWhile sleeping, if I don’t plan on showering the next day, I will sleep with my hair in a loose ponytail with a satin scrunchie on top of my head, and then glaze some water over it the next morning for an alright refresh with less defined but still voluminous curls.
