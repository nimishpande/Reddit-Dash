      "content": "* Before\n   *  So in 2019, I used to weigh around 100 kg and I was on a really bad routine of eating a lot of junk food and not working out a single hour a week. And had no information about skincare routine. I used to apply Vaseline on my face as a moisturizer and used to use really bad face washes like Garnier Acne fight etc. \n* After\n   * So, on **1 October 2020**, I started my fitness journey, and since then, have lost around **25 kg of weight.** \n   * Currently, I weigh around **75 kgs**, though I am skinny fat, but gained a lot of muscles in the last 4 to 5 months, and if everything goes well, I'll be shredded\n   * Now I follow a **minimal yet consistent skin routine**, so I use the following three items on a daily basis:\n   1. For face wash, I use a benzoyl peroxide gel cleanser\n   2. For face cream, I use an Episoft AC, which is a combination of moisturizer plus sunscreen\n   3. I also have a benzoyl peroxide gel, which I use on my pimples because even now I get a lot of pimples if I don't properly follow my skincare routine and if I eat out a lot of junk food\n\n**Things which worked for me as a person who has an acne-prone face genetically not just a teenage puberty phase.**\n\n1. Following a proper skincare routine with **cleanser**, **moisturizer** (since my moisturizer is a combination of sunscreen and moisturizer, so I don't use a separate sunscreen at least for now.) \n\n2. Working out and losing excess fat. \n\n3. Not going out in direct sun and using an umbrella as much as possible.   \n  \n **things to avoid** \n\n1. never use hard face washes that strip out all the oils from your body. Always use a very light and non-invasive face wash like Cetaphil or Benzoyl Peroxide Gel \n\n2.  if your face is very oily, always use moisturizers which are very light and don't have oils in them. Basically, you can figure this out by testing out the consistency. If the viscosity of the moisturizer is very high, then it has oil, and if it is very drain kind of, then it is oil-free.  \n  \n3. figure out your trigger points for acne. I have realized that if I eat too much sugar or eat a lot of food, then I get acne the next day, and it can be different for different people, but you must have to figure out and identify various triggers that are there in your body that cause acne ",

I don't know whether this will work for others, but here's the routine she did for me:\n\nShe began styling my hair when it was extremely wet.\n\nShe used much more product than I typically use. I have fine hair, so I always went easy on the product. She went section by section and coated that hair thoroughly. (It was a light foam for my fine hair, but could be heavier based on texture.) Each section of hair was carefully coated root to ends.\n\nShe applied some Innersense finishing spray to reduce drying time. I'm not sure all finishing sprays can be used this way - probably not - but I found several blow dry sprays on Amazon that are designed to cut dry time (e.g. Kenra,  Colorwow, Redken).\n\nShe finger combed it with a focus on creating ribboned clumps. (This was not tedious finger curling, just raking section by section to clump and ribbon the hair. She said anything that looks sloppy and haphazard while wet will become frizz when dry.\n\nOnce I had some ribboned clumps, she carefully scrunched the ribbons in her hand once, held the hair close to the head, and pulsed a few times. If you've ever \"squished to condish,\" it was just like that.\n\nShe used to diffuser for several minutes to hover over the hair and dry it a bit without touching it.\n\nOnce a cast started setting up, she gently picked up sections of the hair and put just the ends in the bowl of the diffuser. The goal was to dry the ends without disturbing the hair too much.\n\nFinally, when it was maybe 80% dry, she started to pixie dry the hair and scrunch it right up to the roots with the bowl of the diffuser. She had me tip my head to one side and then to the other to get a little volume toward the roots. She advised *not* to tip fully upside down, as it would disturb the hair too much.\n\nAt the end, she used some serum to break the cast. (I don't have serum at home, so I used a drop of LUS oil.)\n\nI've been sleeping in a bonnet at night, and my hair looks perfect the next day. The curls really hold.\n\nAll products at the salon were Innersense. I use LUS at home. ",

I know the curls are not defined on this specific day of my hair wash schedule by any means, and I have not perfected my refresh routine, but I want to say that I really dig voluminous hair looks. I want to look like a 🦁 haha! \n\nRoutine: Wash with Mielle rosemary shampoo and random generic Pantene conditioner. \n\nIn really wet hair, rake either Mixed Chicks Curl Sculptor thinned out with water and Aussie gel on top and scrunch. Try to comb crown of head backwards/horizontally and apply those products and scrunch for more volume. Avoid middle part as much as you can. Then, for this look in particular I guess: mix just a little bit of the The Doux Texture mousse/foam, The Doux Honey mousse/foam, Herbal Essences mousse, John Frieda mousse, and Dollar Tree Spa Luxury extra hold mousse. I mix them all together and rake from roots to end and then diffuse however I want, especially upside down for more volume. \n\nAnd then I actually ended up putting my hair in a curly bun with a side part. And the next day after when I took it down, I retouched/rewet my hair leave in conditioner from Dollar Tree and put some The Doux texture mousse around face framing and Dollar Tree coconut hair oil and CHI hair oil and hairsprayed with some Aussie hair spray for hold!\n\nMedia: 1) Hair down after refresh 2) Curly bun with side part before hair refresh day (ignore crusty ass makeup hehe)",

I am a guy that gets about 6-7h of sleep during work weeks. I work out and eat healthy (as good as i can ofcourse) and recently a girly friend of mine suggested doing skin care and how men would really benefit from doing so as most of us don't for some reason. So i picked up a gel cleanser and a moisturizer as recommended by her. But i am just stuck on the benefits of it all as i am really in it for possible health benefits for the long term not so much for acne management or anything. I did some research and apearandly i should also add a suncream to the mix. I am not in it for the beauty i am more so in it for the self care and mainly health benefits. So the question is what are the sience based benefits and does putting these things on my face do me good long term? Or wil it do me bad in the long term.\n\nAs you can probably tell i am quite lost so literaly any help would be appreciated :).",

I am currently still facing a lot of painful acne on my face and blemishes. I have very problematic skin so even if put any moisturiser within 3-4 days whiteheads and comedones starts forming. I do immense amount of research before buying any product like if they are fungal acne safe, have non comedogenic ingredients and are for acne prone skin. I thoroughly research and only then i buy it but still they never work. I am currently using Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel moisturiser cause my skin is dry asff and i know this moisturiser is very light but this is the only thing that is not giving me worse result otherwise every thing broke me out. I used the CeraVe moisturiser, bioderma atoderm gel moisturiser and these high brands also gave me a lot of comedones. Doctor has given me isotretinoin so i am taking it every alternate days. Using derma co 1% hyaluronic sunscreen. My skin at this point is so dull, the spots are all over my face. My face colour doesn’t even match my body colour. I feel so helpless and tired. Also now i hate to go anywhere there is good light.\n\nCan someone tell me what should i do. Should i continue with this moisturiser and sunscreen?",

I had been using Salicylic acid and it didn’t really help so in august I decided to start adapalene (Differin), which I had applied to much so quickly. I got off of it and stuck to niacinamide and gentle cleansers but my skin had kept getting worse. Eventually this October around the 10th I started adapalene again and its now been 2 and almost a half months of consistent use and my acne is only getting worse.\n\nMy routine is (Morning):\n\n- Gentle Cleanser (Cetaphil Hydrating Cleanser)\n- Vitamin C (Ordinary)\n- Moisturizer (Basic Cetaphil Moisturizer)\n\nNight:\n- GC (same as above)\n- Adapalene (differin)\n- Niacinamide (Ordinary 10%)\n- Moisturizer (same as above)\n\nThis has been a huge insecurity for me and I was hoping to find any help at all. I am really worried about my acne, and my hair does fall on my forehead, so that may be the cause of some of my acne. I don’t use any products in my hair anymore and was hoping for any advice or recommendations. Thank you.",

In comparison, when I air dry my hair and follow the same routine, I only need to wash it twice a week.\n\nMy scalp does tends to get itchy during the winter.

      "title": "[Routine help] What can I change about my routine to manage redness and dryness during/after acne flare ups?",
      "content": "Pretty much exactly what it asks in the title! Also sorry about the weird censor I'm a bit insecure about my eyes :( I am a little shiny because I just put on my moisturizer\n\nI am 21 years old, a woman, and a college undergraduate senior. I live in the Northeast USA so the climate is pretty cold and dry right now. I have an oily t-zone and the rest of my skin was normal until this recent acne flare, and now the front of my cheeks are a bit dry. I am unfortunately prone to hyperpigmentation :(\n\nThis flare started around August before the semester and I wasn't particularly stressed at the time, so it wasn't even a stress-induced flare. I was maintaining the same skincare routine I'd had for months. I use the same toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, and laundry detergent. I change and wash my pillowcases once (or sometimes more) per week and put cloths over them and flip them on a strict daily routine because of my OCD. I clip my hair back during the day to keep it out of my face and am practically neurotic about not touching my face unless I'm doing skincare. Water hardness is also not the issue. I eat relatively clean due to certain health conditions and drink roughly 60-80 oz of water a day. All this to say that there wasn't really any change I can link this acne flare to. It kind of just started and then didn't go away.\n\nAfter changing some of my routine I've seen improvements in terms of having less whiteheads pop up, my forehead starting to clear, and the texture of my cheeks being a bit less rough, but my cheeks are still very red and flakes come off of them during the day. I am more red irl than in the pictures :( Is there anything else I can change that might improve the redness and dryness of my cheeks???\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nAM: rinse with water and moisturize with Vanicream. Used to wash face with the Anua cleanser mentioned in PM and then moisturize, but found that it left me dry so I stopped doing that about a year ago. On days with high UV I use Anessa perfect UV sunscreen skincare milk spf50, but most Winter days are not high UV\n\nPM:\n\n\\- Brush teeth then wash face with Anua heartleaf cleansing oil before rinsing off in shower\n\n\\- (Recently added Nov 1) PanOxyl 4% bp acne creamy wash during shower. Replaced The Ordinary glycolipid cream cleanser that I'd been gifted and didn't end up particularly liking or disliking once finishing. Before the gift I used Inkey List SA cleanser and that was also just alright\n\n\\- (Recently added Dec 15) Timeless 20% L-ascorbic acid serum after shower and drying. Use every other day. Hopefully helps with the hyperpigmentation and redness?\n\n\\- IOPE bio-conditioning essence after the serum mostly dries to being just slightly moist to the touch\n\n\\- (Recently added \\~Nov 22) Vanicream moisturizing cream to seal everything in. Replaced Cerave moisturizing cream\n\nMaybe I just have to stick it out and see if the L-ascorbic acid serum works for the redness, but I'd still really like help with the dryness especially because it's Winter now. I'd maybe include exfoliating to get the flaky skin off, but I'm worried about exacerbating the dryness. If anyone has any suggestions for what I can change about my routine for the redness and dryness, please let me know! Thank you so much.",
