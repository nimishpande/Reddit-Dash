Then try my best to diffuse it after I scrunched the product with a tshirt. Afterwards I let whatever is still wet dry and go from there",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Please ignore my face in them. I took these just to track my hair and never thought I’d be posting them 😬\n\nI only found out I had curly/semi-curly hair a couple months ago after literally years of blow-drying it straight. So I’m still figuring everything out and honestly I feel like half the time I have no clue what I’m doing. I get some decent results but it’s inconsistent and I know the routine probably needs work. I really like the look and I feel like it could be way better.\n\nHere’s my routine right now:\n\n**Right after shower (still dripping):**\n\n1. Quick rake-through\n2. Distilled water mist\n3. Light rake and shake for clumps\n4. SheaMoisture Curl and Shine spray\n5. Another light rake and shake\n6. 50/50 mix of Hairstory Hair Balm + OUAI Curl Cream\n7. Final rake and shake\n8. Scrunch\n\n*I do almost all the rake-and-shake/scrunching upside down so gravity helps the curls form.*\n\n**Drying:**\n\n* Diffuse about 80-90 percent dry, moving around to avoid overheating anything\n* Let the last little bit air dry\n\n**Finishing:**\n* Very gentle lift at the roots to break the cast without ruining the curls\n* Small amount of Based Styling Powder for volume/hold\n* Tiny bit of hairspray (Kenra 25 or 35)\n\n\n\nStuff I’m confused on and hoping for advice about:\n\n* Am I doing the rake and shake too early?\n* When should styling powder actually be used? Before scrunching, after, only when dry?\n* Does my product order make sense or am I mixing things wrong?\n* Any tips to get bigger clumps?\n* Better diffusing tips for hair that’s around 6-7 inches long?\n* Anything in the pics that jumps out as an obvious fix?\n* Any reference or inspo photos with similar hair is greatly appreciated  \n\nI appreciate any help. Just trying to go from “decent” to “actually good” and not screw this up lol",

For some context I’m 23 and I’ve been on FIN for 8 months and dut .5 mg everyday for 6 months. I’ve also been taking oral minoxidil for 11 months (2.5mg for 8 months then upped to 5mg for 3 months. While taking oral Min I have been noticing an increase in body hair and I’ve grown hair on parts of my body that literally never had hair before. I have pretty severe diffuse thinning and my scalp has pretty much stayed the same. I know I’m not unresponsive to minoxidil due to body hair growth so does this mean I am just sensitive to dht or my follicles are just permanently dead? I’ve only really experienced a shed when i introduced dut which then later stabilized. I recently buzzed my hair (last photos) but i included photos from before I buzzed it and from last year which was basically baseline for me. I am going to stay on treatment and see if dut can maybe gave some more regrowth but I’m starting to think a transplant is the only option for me. Has anyone had any growth past one year of oral minoxidil? ",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

So, I did a little AI editing (i know, gross, but i needed to see) on my hair to see which looks best, except I have blonde blindness and I still love the blonde.

I’m also looking for moisturizer suggestions that would suit acne-prone, normal-to-dry skin. Do you guys think this routine makes sense, or is there something better he should use?

It’s lightweight, absorbs quickly, and never feels greasy, which makes it great for daily use or under makeup. It’s gentle and affordable, so it’s one of those products you don’t feel bad slathering on. The downside is that it’s not super rich, so in colder weather it might not be enough on its own, and it definitely doesn’t help with oil control if you’re on the oilier side. But here’s what surprised me the most: whenever my skin suddenly gets red or irritated, I put two or three pumps on at night as a thick layer and seal it with Vaseline. Every time I do this, I wake up with the redness noticeably reduced. So overall, it’s a reliable, no-drama moisturizer that works well for everyday hydration, even if you might need something heavier for extreme dryness.",
