But with my new routine it comes out bangin’ everytime!\n\nMy Routine:\n\nShampoo and condition with prose custom hair care. Brush through conditioner with tangle teaser comb. Apply prose curl cream on wet hair. I use the “define” bounce curl brush (absolute game changer) to style in sections. Using prayer hands method I apply gel after styling each section. I use the ouidad heat and humidity gel but I also liked the one I got from prose. Scrunch everything together and plop in a microfiber towel. Allow to dry - air drying is best but I also diffuse if I need it to dry quicker. Then scrunch out the crunch with an oil if I have time. I’m using the olaplex bonding oil. \n\nOverall, I think the bounce curl brush and mastering a gel cast have made the biggest difference. I’m slowly figuring out how to get my curls to last multiple days but I’m still looking for tips! I’m putting my hair in a pineapple overnight and using silk pillowcases. I have a bonnet but I kind of hate doing it lol. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I have combination/oily skin and I absolutely hate how the texture looks in certain lighting and in photos 🫤 Over the years I’ve used retinol, SA, Mandelic acid, benzoyl peroxide, Nizoral (I was told it was fungal acne at one point)… and nothings ever really improved it. I currently started using Azelaic acid a few weeks ago and can’t tell if it’s making a difference yet, along with my Cerave Daily Moisturizer.\n\nThe only time I feel like it looks better is when I get out of the pool lol. \n\nI get married next year and would be so overjoyed if I could smooth it out before then.

      "content": "Hi all! \n\nI’m looking to change my skincare routine over the course of the next couple months. I’d like to finish using the products that I have and slowly build a new routine with new products, as I am not happy with the ones I currently use.\n\nI usually just buy whatever is cheap and at the store, but I’m looking to change it up so that my skin and makeup looks better.\n\n\nCurrent morning routine:\n\n- Wash face with just water\n- Random spf moisturizer \n\nCurrent evening routine:\n\n- CeraVe oil cleanser (i hate this specific oil cleanser, but have liked previous ones)\n- The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% serum \n- Random evening moisturizer\n\n\nMy main reasons for wanting to switch up:\n- My skin and makeup looks BAD! I recently learned that your foundation and moisturizer and cleanser have to all be oil based or water based for it to not peel and get splotchy, which is a major problem I have.\n- I’m hoping to get products from only one or two brands, or brands that are carried at a single store, as it will make my life easier and I think it will ultimately be cheaper\n\nI have no idea what brands are good, I am very stressed and busy with school, Christmas, personal health issues and trying to find a job, so I’m very sorry if it sounds like I put zero effort into researching. I did try to a little, but there’s so much to learn and I just don’t have the capacity for it right now :(\n\nI want a morning cleanser, an evening cleanser (idk if they need to be different), something to help with patchy redness and uneven colour, something to help with early aging signs, an spf moisturizer for the morning and another moisturizer for the evening. Maybe an exfoliating type of thing that I could do every other week or something would be cool too? It would also be awesome if I could stop shedding skin every time i rubbed my forehead… it makes me feel very gross.\n\nI’m open to water or oil based, but I don’t know how to choose. \n\nInfo:\n- 21F\n- Very fair skin\n- Combination skin? It feels oily but also flakes so I’m not sure\n- Looking for cheaper products hopefully, but again I won’t be buying them all at once so not a huge deal if they’re a bit expensive\n\nI just want to feel pretty again haha.

I have no idea how to take care of it or make it look decent. It’s super unmanageable and I feel like I’m stuck in that awkward stage where nothing looks good no matter what I try.\n\nI’ve tried a few products but nothing seems to work for my hair, and I can’t figure out what kind of style would actually suit me. I just feel like I really need a change, something that fits my face shape and hair texture better.\n\nI’m adding a photo so you can see what I’m working with. If anyone has any suggestions for cuts, styles, or products that could help me get my hair under control, I’d really appreciate it.\n\n**Routine:**\n\n* **Shampoo / Conditioner:** Dove Ultra Care shampoo and conditioner. I only shampoo once a week, but I use conditioner every day.\n* **Styling products:** I use a coconut cream from Aussie to help detangle and style my hair, plus a bit of argan oil afterward.\n* **Drying method:** I don’t use any blow dryer or heat tools. I just towel dry gently and let it air dry completely.\n* **Other details:** I always detangle my hair after showering.\n\nThanks a lot for reading and for any advice you can share!",

Currently, no curly hair catered curly routine.\n\nProducts used\nShampoo - Plantur 39\nShampoo - Redkin Extreme Length\nShampoo - Ouai Detox Shampoo (once a month)\n\nConditioner - Redken Exteeme Length \nDeep Condition - Ouai Fine to Medium Treatment Masque (once a month)\n\nL'Oréal Elvive Glycolic Gloss\n\nAfter Shower Care - use this alternately\nRedken Extreme Length Sealer\nL'Oréal Elvive - Bond Repair\nAmika Superfruit Star Hair Oil\n\nI don't even know what type of curl I have anymore but it's dry and frizzy, I home dye it, and I also have fine hair. I find when I use too many products, it weighs my hair down. I am self conscious when I have curly hair and dont think it \"suits\" me but I really want to use this as an opportunity to love my curls again.\n\nI have the Shark Flexstyle and will be bringing that up on my travels with me.\n\nAny advice on some products I can use to style without weighing it down? I am based In Australia, so something easily accessible would be amazing.\n\nThanks in advance ☺️ \n",

A few days after the waxing, I started getting bumps on those 3 area, and they still haven’t gone away I’m guessing they showed up when the hair started growing back\n\nFor the past month I’ve been doing a homemade honey based scrub once a week and moisturizing every day after my shower with aloe vera, but as you can see in the photos, I still have a lot of bumps. I used to have almost 0 bumps on my body so this is really concerning me :\n\nDo you have any advice or solutions? ( In my country where I live it is legit impossible to have an appointement with a dermatologist before few months so that's also why I’m turning to you for advice.\n\nThanks for reading me !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e2txzc2yev4g1.jpg?width=2544&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a41d6e897a8e805425494253da6532b9c9d5a5a7\n\n",

I’ve bought so many different series and right now I have a bunch of products/product lines and I don’t know what to do with them (it’s not TOO much, but about five different series and then products in that serie). \n\nMy hair dresser sold me a certain brand that she recommended depended on my hair type, and so far I think it works pretty good.\n\nHas anyone ever been in this situation, and does anyone have any ideas on what to do with the ones I don’t use? \n\nI’d love all answers, I hope everyone is having a great day!",

I had been using a salicylic acid face wash for about a year, but now I don’t use any skincare products (except the Deconstruct gel-based sunscreen).\n\nThe second type of acne is probably something I made worse myself. I started applying the Deconstruct 5% Niacinamide + 2% Alpha Arbutin serum on my face, and within a month, I suddenly developed so many of these pimples.\n\nPlease suggest some solution for this. 🙏🙏🙏",
