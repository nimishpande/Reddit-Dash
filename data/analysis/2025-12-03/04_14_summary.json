But with my new routine it comes out bangin’ everytime!\n\nMy Routine:\n\nShampoo and condition with prose custom hair care. Brush through conditioner with tangle teaser comb. Apply prose curl cream on wet hair. I use the “define” bounce curl brush (absolute game changer) to style in sections. Using prayer hands method I apply gel after styling each section. I use the ouidad heat and humidity gel but I also liked the one I got from prose. Scrunch everything together and plop in a microfiber towel. Allow to dry - air drying is best but I also diffuse if I need it to dry quicker. Then scrunch out the crunch with an oil if I have time. I’m using the olaplex bonding oil. \n\nOverall, I think the bounce curl brush and mastering a gel cast have made the biggest difference. I’m slowly figuring out how to get my curls to last multiple days but I’m still looking for tips! I’m putting my hair in a pineapple overnight and using silk pillowcases. I have a bonnet but I kind of hate doing it lol. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I love the ziziphus mask, and whenever I see my curls looking messy, I immediately make it. First, my scalp gets cleaned and it removes dan- druff and fun-gi from the hair and scalp. I have sebo-derm, and I feel like it soothes my scalp and reduce the problems. I'd be lying if I said it gets rid of it 100%. It does calm it down and might remove it, but it eventually comes back. I use it once every two weeks❤️\n\nRoutine: I washed my hair with water only then I mix 6tbsp of Ziziphus, 3tbsp Amla powder ,4tbsp Aloe Vera powder, brahmi powder 5tbsp, Bhrjintaj 5tbsp, 4tbsp of Shikakai powder I mixed all these with hibiscus tea. I waited 30m till I saw ziziphus bubbles spread everywhere. U should leave it 30m so the ziziphus becomes more effective 👍🏻. I put 2 drops of Indonesian Cajeput essential oil, after 30m I put the mask on my wet hair then I cover my hair very well and leave it for 15m then I washed it only with co wash I used the co wash 3 times to make sure my hair is clean and no ziziphus stuck in my hair.\n\n\nStyling products: Inhasi leave in spray frangece free, Lola From Rio gel, brush with bounce curl volume brush and diffuse with Dyson Nural. \nHave u ever tried a ziziphus in ur hair or face?

I switched because I would break out once a month on tretinoin, and I hoped differin would be more gentle and help with this. However, after a month of using differin once a week, my acne’s gotten way worse (the worst it’s ever been). Should I switch back to tretinoin, or is it normal to break out despite already being on a retinoid?\n\nMorning routine: wash with water, tower 28 spray\n\nNight routine: cerave sensitive cleaner, tower 28 spray, cerave moisturizer\n\nAny and all advice is appreciated!",

I’m planning to gift him some products for his birthday to experiment as well as just help him out in general.\n\nSo far my research says that his hair is 2C to 3A, but please let me know if I’m wrong.\n\nHis routine is pretty basic, just double shampoo (Nizoral &gt; L’Oreal Hyaluron Plump Shampoo) and conditioner (Tsubaki Premium Moist &amp; Repair Conditioner).\n\nHe washes his hair normally, doesn’t scrunch or anything. He blow-dries his hair directly, no products after. He uses a fine comb (claims that it looks better when it’s “straighter”).\n\nHe’s trying to grow it out right now to see his options (he likes the look of flows). The photo attached is his hair with no products on, after combing.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. What styling products are best for his hair type (for both a straighter look and a curlier look)?\n\n2. What does the quality of his hair look like so far? Is it dry or damaged, or is it just not living to its full potential yet?\n\n3. Any haircut suggestions for this type of hair? And should he keep growing it out?\n\nAny suggestions are greatly appreciated. (Please don’t be mean)",

It’s super unmanageable and I feel like I’m stuck in that awkward stage where nothing looks good no matter what I try.\n\nI’ve tried a few products but nothing seems to work for my hair, and I can’t figure out what kind of style would actually suit me. I just feel like I really need a change, something that fits my face shape and hair texture better.\n\nI’m adding a photo so you can see what I’m working with. If anyone has any suggestions for cuts, styles, or products that could help me get my hair under control, I’d really appreciate it.\n\n**Routine:**\n\n* **Shampoo / Conditioner:** Dove Ultra Care shampoo and conditioner. I only shampoo once a week, but I use conditioner every day.\n* **Styling products:** I use a coconut cream from Aussie to help detangle and style my hair, plus a bit of argan oil afterward.\n* **Drying method:** I don’t use any blow dryer or heat tools. I just towel dry gently and let it air dry completely.\n* **Other details:** I always detangle my hair after showering.\n\nThanks a lot for reading and for any advice you can share!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
