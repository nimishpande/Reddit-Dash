But with my new routine it comes out bangin’ everytime!\n\nMy Routine:\n\nShampoo and condition with prose custom hair care. Brush through conditioner with tangle teaser comb. Apply prose curl cream on wet hair. I use the “define” bounce curl brush (absolute game changer) to style in sections. Using prayer hands method I apply gel after styling each section. I use the ouidad heat and humidity gel but I also liked the one I got from prose. Scrunch everything together and plop in a microfiber towel. Allow to dry - air drying is best but I also diffuse if I need it to dry quicker. Then scrunch out the crunch with an oil if I have time. I’m using the olaplex bonding oil. \n\nOverall, I think the bounce curl brush and mastering a gel cast have made the biggest difference. I’m slowly figuring out how to get my curls to last multiple days but I’m still looking for tips! I’m putting my hair in a pineapple overnight and using silk pillowcases. I have a bonnet but I kind of hate doing it lol. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "In south of Iran, we like to use ziziphus powder as a facial cleanser or a face mask, and we also use it as a shampoo substitute or as a hair mask and many uses. I love the ziziphus mask, and whenever I see my curls looking messy, I immediately make it. First, my scalp gets cleaned and it removes dan- druff and fun-gi from the hair and scalp. I have sebo-derm, and I feel like it soothes my scalp and reduce the problems. I'd be lying if I said it gets rid of it 100%. It does calm it down and might remove it, but it eventually comes back. I use it once every two weeks❤️\n\nRoutine: I washed my hair with water only then I mix 6tbsp of Ziziphus, 3tbsp Amla powder ,4tbsp Aloe Vera powder, brahmi powder 5tbsp, Bhrjintaj 5tbsp, 4tbsp of Shikakai powder I mixed all these with hibiscus tea. I waited 30m till I saw ziziphus bubbles spread everywhere. U should leave it 30m so the ziziphus becomes more effective 👍🏻. I put 2 drops of Indonesian Cajeput essential oil, after 30m I put the mask on my wet hair then I cover my hair very well and leave it for 15m then I washed it only with co wash I used the co wash 3 times to make sure my hair is clean and no ziziphus stuck in my hair.\n\n\nStyling products: Inhasi leave in spray frangece free, Lola From Rio gel, brush with bounce curl volume brush and diffuse with Dyson Nural. \nHave u ever tried a ziziphus in ur hair or face? Let me know what was ur experience 😍",

She doesn't like spending more than $10 on a product but is allowing me to buy her something more expensive for Christmas. Her hair is soft and manageable, but she wants it be shiny, flowy, silky. In her words, \"I want my hair to look like it can be in an old-school Garnier commercial\".\n\nHer hair type is 2A, length goes down to her lower back, and she doesn't color or chemically treat her hair. Her current routine is L'oreal EverPure moisture shampoo, Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine leave-in conditioner, then a heat protectant followed by blow drying on low to medium heat. She washes her hair once to twice a week and wants something that will either go before, after, or replaces her heat protectant.\n\nMy budget is anywhere from $10-$40. Any recommendations and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",

      "content": "Hi all! \n\nI’m looking to change my skincare routine over the course of the next couple months. I’d like to finish using the products that I have and slowly build a new routine with new products, as I am not happy with the ones I currently use.\n\nI usually just buy whatever is cheap and at the store, but I’m looking to change it up so that my skin and makeup looks better.\n\n\nCurrent morning routine:\n\n- Wash face with just water\n- Random spf moisturizer \n\nCurrent evening routine:\n\n- CeraVe oil cleanser (i hate this specific oil cleanser, but have liked previous ones)\n- The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% serum \n- Random evening moisturizer\n\n\nMy main reasons for wanting to switch up:\n- My skin and makeup looks BAD! I recently learned that your foundation and moisturizer and cleanser have to all be oil based or water based for it to not peel and get splotchy, which is a major problem I have.\n- I’m hoping to get products from only one or two brands, or brands that are carried at a single store, as it will make my life easier and I think it will ultimately be cheaper\n\nI have no idea what brands are good, I am very stressed and busy with school, Christmas, personal health issues and trying to find a job, so I’m very sorry if it sounds like I put zero effort into researching. I did try to a little, but there’s so much to learn and I just don’t have the capacity for it right now :(\n\nI want a morning cleanser, an evening cleanser (idk if they need to be different), something to help with patchy redness and uneven colour, something to help with early aging signs, an spf moisturizer for the morning and another moisturizer for the evening. Maybe an exfoliating type of thing that I could do every other week or something would be cool too? It would also be awesome if I could stop shedding skin every time i rubbed my forehead… it makes me feel very gross.\n\nI’m open to water or oil based, but I don’t know how to choose. \n\nInfo:\n- 21F\n- Very fair skin\n- Combination skin? It feels oily but also flakes so I’m not sure\n- Looking for cheaper products hopefully, but again I won’t be buying them all at once so not a huge deal if they’re a bit expensive\n\nI just want to feel pretty again haha. Thanks in advance!",

I took them out of my hair, and stupidly left them in a heap !! \n\nThey were covered in baby oil from removing them, and both sides of the weft were sticky - probably from leaving them in a mess on top of each other. I was able to get the oil out but I cannot for love nor money get rid of the glue and goo on the wefts😭😭\n\nI’ve tried baby powder, acetone nail polish remover, baby wipes and a cuticle pusher and they’re still so so sticky on both sides🥴\n\nIf anyone can give me any tips and help I would be so so grateful 🙏🏼 \n\nMost of them still have baby powder on them they’re clean otherwise🤭 \n",

I have no idea how to take care of it or make it look decent. It’s super unmanageable and I feel like I’m stuck in that awkward stage where nothing looks good no matter what I try.\n\nI’ve tried a few products but nothing seems to work for my hair, and I can’t figure out what kind of style would actually suit me. I just feel like I really need a change, something that fits my face shape and hair texture better.\n\nI’m adding a photo so you can see what I’m working with. If anyone has any suggestions for cuts, styles, or products that could help me get my hair under control, I’d really appreciate it.\n\n**Routine:**\n\n* **Shampoo / Conditioner:** Dove Ultra Care shampoo and conditioner. I only shampoo once a week, but I use conditioner every day.\n* **Styling products:** I use a coconut cream from Aussie to help detangle and style my hair, plus a bit of argan oil afterward.\n* **Drying method:** I don’t use any blow dryer or heat tools. I just towel dry gently and let it air dry completely.\n* **Other details:** I always detangle my hair after showering.\n\nThanks a lot for reading and for any advice you can share!",

The rest of the week I don’t do anything besides like the third or fourth day where I wet it again and put leave in conditioner because my hair is dry. I want to start caring for my hair but I don’t want to damage it. \n\nI want to start washing my hair twice a week now because my hair is good (not too dry or frizzy) for like three days. But besides the products I put on the day of washing it, is it ok to put product in your hair and wetting it everyday, or is that too much? I heard constantly putting water on your hair can damage it by causing breakage. Or is this a trial and error thing that I need to figure out on my own? Sorry for any confusion. Thanks in advance. ",

I had been using a salicylic acid face wash for about a year, but now I don’t use any skincare products (except the Deconstruct gel-based sunscreen).\n\nThe second type of acne is probably something I made worse myself. I started applying the Deconstruct 5% Niacinamide + 2% Alpha Arbutin serum on my face, and within a month, I suddenly developed so many of these pimples.\n\nPlease suggest some solution for this. 🙏🙏🙏",

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

A few days after the waxing, I started getting bumps on those 3 area, and they still haven’t gone away I’m guessing they showed up when the hair started growing back\n\nFor the past month I’ve been doing a homemade honey based scrub once a week and moisturizing every day after my shower with aloe vera, but as you can see in the photos, I still have a lot of bumps. I used to have almost 0 bumps on my body so this is really concerning me :\n\nDo you have any advice or solutions? ( In my country where I live it is legit impossible to have an appointement with a dermatologist before few months so that's also why I’m turning to you for advice.\n\nThanks for reading me !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e2txzc2yev4g1.jpg?width=2544&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a41d6e897a8e805425494253da6532b9c9d5a5a7\n\n",
