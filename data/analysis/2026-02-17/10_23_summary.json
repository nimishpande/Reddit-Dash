      "content": "title is my question in a nutshell. i unfortunately have fine curly hair, this is my routine:\n\n1. wash like once a week with l'real elvive hyaluron plump 72 hour hydrating shampoo (i honestly just grabbed this kind of at random a long time ago, but recently bought the Camille Rose guava slip detangling shampoo to try)\n2. comb through and use Shea Moisture Jamaican black castor oil strengthen &amp; restore leave-in conditioner after washing or wetting my hair\n3. deep condition once a week after washing with Argan Oil from Morocco Intensive Conditioning Treatment\n4. style with the bounce curl brush and AG Re-Coil Curl Activator, Argan Oil Style &amp; Shine Foaming Mousse, and a gel over that. i was using Not Your Mother's Frizz Control Sculpting Gel #3, but found it to be not quite enough hold, so starting using 4U by Tia's Strong Hold Gel and it's honestly a bit too much and very thick, so i'm in the market for a new gel i suppose. AG's Re-Coil Curl Activator has been a game changer, so i've been wanting to try their gel mousse but haven't found at a store near me yet.\n5. after styling i blow dry my hair to probably, realistically, about 40-50% dry with Infiniti Pro Conair Hair Dryer + diffuser attachment. even with the strong hold gel, that's about as much as i can blow dry it without introducing frizz (sob).\n6. i sleep with a Moonstone 7 satin sleeper hair bonnet on (it was about $70 but i am an extremely restless sleeper and it almost always stays on my head the whole night through) and silk pillowcases underneath that.\n7. on day 2 hair, i use the Infiniti PRO by CONAIR Steam Therapy Hair Steamer + diffuser attachment to spruce up my curls a little bit, then rub a bit of Re-Coil Curl Activator with water between my hands to scrunch and set.\n\n\n\nif you have fine curly hair and are still with me after all that, i desperately want to know if only making it two days without having to wash/re-wet is normal for you. by the end of day two my hair is so tangled and frizzy that i don't dare let it go any longer without re-wetting and detangling, and i always lose a big ol handful of hair doing it. if that's normal for most people with fine curly hair i can live with it, but if it's a matter of better products, what should i try?\n\ni also know that hair is more easily damaged when wet and it's not great to always have to re-wet it in order for it to look good, because you can get trapped in a vicious cycle of \"it only looks good when I re-wet it\" --&gt; rewetting it --&gt; it gets more damaged because of the time it spends wet and looks worse dry, making you think you need to re-wet it--&gt;ad infinitum.\n\nsimilar question about blowdrying. if you have fine curly hair, are you actually able to blow dry it 100% dry without introducing frizz? do i need a better blowdryer? stronger gel? my hair takes forever to dry the other 50-60%, and i hate how it looks stuck to my head while it's still in the gel cast during this time. i feel like a drowned cat.",

Vaseline lip therapy, Laniege masks and lip balms, Boroline.. pretty much everything. Still my lips used to bleed and hurt like crazy especialllly in winters. Buuuuuuuuuut I have finally found what worked for me: CASTOR OIL.\n\nI used it because it the bottle was lying next to me (I use it in my hair too) and I was too lazy to get the sleeping mask from upstairs. But ISTG I woke up with the softest and most moisturised lips ever. I have been using only castor oil as a lip mask since then. I use it in the day too when I dont have to go out anywhere. Just a drop or two are more than enough because it is already a bit thick and heavy.\n\nIt does feel a bit sticky on the lips because duh its an oil. But I swear it works amazingly. It is actually very very moisturising. It has helped me with pigmentation as well. Honestly pigmentation was never an issue for me, personally but my lips are definitely a lot pinker than before. Probably because dryer lips gets a bit darker?\n\nIt is affordable as hell as well. Got two bottles(500 ml each) for 249 from amazon on a sale long back ago. and I am only halfway through the first bottle so far.\n\nDo give it a try if you have chapped or dry lips\n\nBubbye &lt;3",

I’ll follow a treatment plan, see improvement and then out of nowhere pimples start showing up again sometimes in the same areas, sometimes completely new spots on my face. It makes me feel like I’m constantly starting over.\n\nI try to be consistent now i don’t switch products impulsively anymore, i give things time. But still somehow the cycle repeats like my skin is clear for a bit, then breakouts again. It makes me question whether I’m even treating the right problem.\n\nWhat bothers me is not knowing why. Is it hormones? Stress? Something internal? Or am I just missing something obvious? Without understanding the cause, every new pimple feels discouraging and personal. If you’ve dealt with recurring face pimples even after treatment, how did you figure out what was actually going on?",

Some things help for a few weeks then my skin goes right back to breaking out like nothing ever happened.\n\nWhat bothers me the most isn’t just the acne itself, it’s the constant mental load. I wake up and the first thing I do is check my face. I avoid plans when my skin flares. I second-guess photos. I feel less confident at work and socially, even though I know it shouldn’t matter this much.\n\nDerm visits are expensive and hard to get into where I live, so a lot of this has been trial and error on my own.

I work in construction and for pretty much all of 2024/2025, I worked outside in the sun for 8-10 hours a day without sunscreen or moisturizer. I know, this is the ultimate sin in skincare, but I have started to take care of my skin starting in around September of last year. My routine now consists of a cleanser, moisturizer, sunsceen, vitamin c, and retinol. I have seen massive changes in the brightness and texture of my skin since starting this routine, but I still have a long way to go.\n\nMy question is what should I do about the dark spots all over my skin (specially in my cheek areas). I'm trying to make my skin all the same complexion and tone. Any advice in general to help imrpove my skin is appreciated. Also, I only looking to add 1 or 2 products max due to budget. Thanks.",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

As a teenager I had to cut my hair very short because of my very long phase of bleaching it and dye it very bright and colorful hair dye( plus heat damage ). They were heavily damaged, and cutting it short made me feel very insecure. It’s not a tragic tale and it was definetly my fault but my “short phase” lasted 4 years, in which i felt very ugly. then, at 17yo I let it grow out, and for the past 7 years my long hair has become an important source of self esteem and confidence.  \n\nyesterday i Made the big decision to go to an hairstylist after eight years of cutting my hair by myself. I wanted her to chop off a big chunk of it, and kinda give me a long bob, like shoulder lenght. I never really went to an hairstylist as an adult especially for something so big. I showed her a pic, she asked me if  i wanted to thin them out, i said no.  \n\nI’m not here to hate on the hairstylist, but i really hate the cut. The layers ( that I didnt ask ) are chonky to me, and she definetly thinned my hair out. they are not shoulder lenght from behind, but the layers on top are so short, and the strands on the front are so short, that I dont want to cut them again trying to match it. I’m pretty upset about it, because this was a big step for me.\n\nShould i just let it grow and wait for them to reach ( the layers ) a lenght that I “like”, to cut them straight uniforming the lenghts? Im very scared to touch them again rn. am i being very dramatic? I dont know, i dont feel good. Thanks to anyone willing to help.",

I went to urgent care and the doctor could not stitch it as it was too wide and the ends weren’t coming together when she would pinch it. I was prescribed mupirocin, and my friend also mentioned colloid bands as a way to prevent scarring. Obviously I also know that once this heals I’ll need to apply sunscreen everyday, and until then I’m keeping nonadherent bandages on it with mupirocin applied. Making sure no hair gets in either. Heard good things about silicone gels as well once it’s more healed. I’m just really worried this is gonna leave a noticeable mark and I wanted more opinions on it.",
