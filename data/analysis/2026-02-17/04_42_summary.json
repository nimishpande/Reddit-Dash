      "content": "title is my question in a nutshell. i unfortunately have fine curly hair, this is my routine:\n\n1. wash like once a week with l'real elvive hyaluron plump 72 hour hydrating shampoo (i honestly just grabbed this kind of at random a long time ago, but recently bought the Camille Rose guava slip detangling shampoo to try)\n2. comb through and use Shea Moisture Jamaican black castor oil strengthen &amp; restore leave-in conditioner after washing or wetting my hair\n3. deep condition once a week after washing with Argan Oil from Morocco Intensive Conditioning Treatment\n4. style with the bounce curl brush and AG Re-Coil Curl Activator, Argan Oil Style &amp; Shine Foaming Mousse, and a gel over that. i was using Not Your Mother's Frizz Control Sculpting Gel #3, but found it to be not quite enough hold, so starting using 4U by Tia's Strong Hold Gel and it's honestly a bit too much and very thick, so i'm in the market for a new gel i suppose. AG's Re-Coil Curl Activator has been a game changer, so i've been wanting to try their gel mousse but haven't found at a store near me yet.\n5. after styling i blow dry my hair to probably, realistically, about 40-50% dry with Infiniti Pro Conair Hair Dryer + diffuser attachment. even with the strong hold gel, that's about as much as i can blow dry it without introducing frizz (sob).\n6. i sleep with a Moonstone 7 satin sleeper hair bonnet on (it was about $70 but i am an extremely restless sleeper and it almost always stays on my head the whole night through) and silk pillowcases underneath that.\n7. on day 2 hair, i use the Infiniti PRO by CONAIR Steam Therapy Hair Steamer + diffuser attachment to spruce up my curls a little bit, then rub a bit of Re-Coil Curl Activator with water between my hands to scrunch and set.\n\n\n\nif you have fine curly hair and are still with me after all that, i desperately want to know if only making it two days without having to wash/re-wet is normal for you. by the end of day two my hair is so tangled and frizzy that i don't dare let it go any longer without re-wetting and detangling, and i always lose a big ol handful of hair doing it. if that's normal for most people with fine curly hair i can live with it, but if it's a matter of better products, what should i try?\n\ni also know that hair is more easily damaged when wet and it's not great to always have to re-wet it in order for it to look good, because you can get trapped in a vicious cycle of \"it only looks good when I re-wet it\" --&gt; rewetting it --&gt; it gets more damaged because of the time it spends wet and looks worse dry, making you think you need to re-wet it--&gt;ad infinitum.\n\nsimilar question about blowdrying. if you have fine curly hair, are you actually able to blow dry it 100% dry without introducing frizz? do i need a better blowdryer? stronger gel? my hair takes forever to dry the other 50-60%, and i hate how it looks stuck to my head while it's still in the gel cast during this time. i feel like a drowned cat.",

      "content": "Hi all, this girl is ((very)) sad about a situation that is out of my control. It's been going on for months, and the stress has led me to neglect my appearance almost entirely.\n\nI won't get into it too much here, but I'm hoping to get a little advice if possible on where to start when it comes to taking care of myself again. Here's where I'm at currently:\n\nHair: quality is great, but it's maybe too long. It is to my lower back now, and while my ends do look pretty good, my hair is one length, blunt cut, and quite flat. It will hold curl with a strong hairspray, though. Originally, I was trying to go for a super long, mermaid look, but my problem is I just don't know how to style it. So, it's flat and straight 99% of the time, unfortunately. I'm leaning towards cutting it to be more mid-length(?), but I just can't think clearly and I don't know whether I'm just sad-cutting my hair, or if I could be happier if I could find a simple, pretty way to style it. My hair is very soft and healthy, just... flat and boring. :(\n\nSkin: skin is alright. I don't have any acne, but my skin is super dull and dry all over my body, face included. I have a small amount of redness on my t-zone that I'm so embarrassed of, and I'm constantly having to reapply concealer during the day. I'm also getting fine lines on my forehead as well as in between my eyes from making sad faces all the time. My eyes are red and puffy, and very tired looking from crying a lot and missing so much sleep. :/ \n\nMakeup look: I'm in survival mode, but I'm still (trying my absolute best) to look somewhat presentable. I'm using some random body lotion as facial moisturizer, a single concealer stick, and a rose tinted tube of burts bees lip balm. My brows and lashes are alright, but my lashes do stick straight out and you cant really see them.\n\nI'm hoping that someone can maybe give me a small amount of advice on how to aproach looking and feeling pretty when I'm feeling this bad. (\\*My situation isn't dire or life threatening, and I am okay, thankfully!), but I'm spending most days in bed or sleeping, and I'm earnestly wanting to try putting more effort into my appearance again. I'm just so overwhelmed and don't know how to start.\n\nthank you for any and all help you guys can give me. I need it right now for sure, because I just want to start feeling like me again. :(",

I shower twice a day, I exfoliate with a mitt 3 times a week (avoiding cysts as they appear), I use an unscented sensitive skin bodywash as well as moisturiser post shower. I DO NOT shave these areas out of fear that they'll flare up worse that they already do. On rare occasions I trim the areas.\n\nI have seen my GP and he insists its hygeine related. I've kind of hit my breaking point as I was showering I gently brought my loofah over my current inflammed ingrown cysts area (on pubes) and it just gushed blood. Warm compresses don't seem to have much effect on them either. I always have an inflammed cyst or ingrown or whatever they are at any given time they range from mild discomfort to clothes touching them hurts. When they do eventually heal and go away they leave either purple scars or chunks gouged out of me despite being careful to avoid picking at them. \n\nIf anyone has some experience with this could they please give me some advice its getting really hard to look at myself in these areas.\n\nThanks.\n\nP.S Picture quality isnt great not used to taking pictures of my butt sorry.",

Vaseline lip therapy, Laniege masks and lip balms, Boroline.. pretty much everything. Still my lips used to bleed and hurt like crazy especialllly in winters. Buuuuuuuuuut I have finally found what worked for me: CASTOR OIL.\n\nI used it because it the bottle was lying next to me (I use it in my hair too) and I was too lazy to get the sleeping mask from upstairs. But ISTG I woke up with the softest and most moisturised lips ever. I have been using only castor oil as a lip mask since then. I use it in the day too when I dont have to go out anywhere. Just a drop or two are more than enough because it is already a bit thick and heavy.\n\nIt does feel a bit sticky on the lips because duh its an oil. But I swear it works amazingly. It is actually very very moisturising. It has helped me with pigmentation as well. Honestly pigmentation was never an issue for me, personally but my lips are definitely a lot pinker than before. Probably because dryer lips gets a bit darker?\n\nIt is affordable as hell as well. Got two bottles(500 ml each) for 249 from amazon on a sale long back ago. and I am only halfway through the first bottle so far.\n\nDo give it a try if you have chapped or dry lips\n\nBubbye &lt;3",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I work in construction and for pretty much all of 2024/2025, I worked outside in the sun for 8-10 hours a day without sunscreen or moisturizer. I know, this is the ultimate sin in skincare, but I have started to take care of my skin starting in around September of last year. My routine now consists of a cleanser, moisturizer, sunsceen, vitamin c, and retinol. I have seen massive changes in the brightness and texture of my skin since starting this routine, but I still have a long way to go.\n\nMy question is what should I do about the dark spots all over my skin (specially in my cheek areas). I'm trying to make my skin all the same complexion and tone. Any advice in general to help imrpove my skin is appreciated. Also, I only looking to add 1 or 2 products max due to budget. Thanks.",

As of late I’ve been practicing this thing called “attempting to get my life together.” I’m not super proud of it, but I’ve finally been able to establish a routine for my teeth (it used to be sporadic/ when I remembered. Again, not proud). And now that I’ve got that down, I’d like to try to something minimal for my face.\n\nI don’t wear makeup, don’t really see the point in it, but I’m really tired of near constant pimples. It isn’t full on acne anymore, but I still have 2 to 3 pimples on my face at any one time. I live in a hot and somewhat humid environment, and I’m not super good about hydrating myself or my skin (we’re working on that too).\n\nI also have eczema. It shows up on my knuckles and legs the most, sometimes my scalp, but rarely my face.\n\nAny ideas for a minimalist and budget friendly face routine?",

I have fine, dry, frizzy, high-porosity, curly-ish hair. My hair has been dry and frizzy my entire life it seems like.\n\nMy routine used to consist of washing and conditioning with whatever shampoo and conditioner I had at the time then adding leave-in conditioning cream, curl cream, mousse, and gel. My hair looked the exact same then as it does now. Now I brush my hair before I get in the shower, wash my hair every 2–4 days with the Aveeno clarify and shine shampoo, condition with the It's a 10 coily miracle mask, and follow up with the Shea Moisture strengthen and restore leave-in conditioner. I've never used any oils or anything. If it matters, I live in an area with really hard water.\n\nIt'd be great if someone could help me out. Also, why is my top layer of hair straighter than my bottom layer? Any tips? Thanks!",
