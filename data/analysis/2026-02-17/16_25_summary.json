I was able to buy all of my normal Innersense products (curl defining foam, defining gel, shampoo and conditioner) here in Spain. I wash once a week and brush styling in sections with a wet brush and the bounce curl brush, and then scrunching in gel. I try to let it air dry for an hour or two and then diffuse. This is the same routine I’ve been doing for a couple of years, but now it turns out terrible.\n\nMy curls won’t clump they’re super stringy and frizzy when wet. When it dries it’s even frizzer, mainly in the back and on top of my head and it’s incredibly crunchy. Scrunching out the crunch with hair oil just seems to make it frizzier. \n\nDoes anyone have any product or styling suggestions? Is it the water or the change in humidity? I really at a loss here and being to hate the hair I once loved.\n\nThe first pic is my hair at in Madrid second and third are my hair in Seattle.",

The Japanese FDA determined that the starting dose of dutasteride for treating androgenetic alopecia should be 0.1 mg and that, if necessary, doctors can titrate up to 0.5 mg.\n\nhttps://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(13)01171-7/abstract\n\nOne study used as the summary basis of approval for low dose dut in Japan suggests that one may expect slightly better hair growth with 0.1 mg oral dutasteride compared with 1 mg or even 5 mg oral finasteride; Harcha et al. randomized 917 men with androgenetic alopecia to dutasteride 0.02 mg, 0.1 mg, or 0.5 mg daily, finasteride 1 mg daily, or placebo for 24 weeks. They found dutasteride worked in a dose dependent way, and the 0.1 mg dose produced higher hair counts and thicker hairs than placebo, with results that generally trended better than finasteride 1 mg, even though the clearest and most statistically robust superiority over finasteride showed up with 0.5 mg.\n\nIt may be that this lower oral dose of dutasteride is intended for someone who wants to further reduce scalp DHT but doesn’t want to fully commit to the 0.5 mg dose, or for someone who doesn’t tolerate 0.5 mg well and still wants to use the drug to some capacity.",

      "content": "Hi everyone. 27F in a big city and I am on public transit a lot. I started wearing a tighter fitting mask again during rush hour and after about a week my skin around my mouth and along my jawline started burning and getting tiny bumps. They are not deep pimples, more like small rough raised dots plus redness. It stings when I put on products that never used to bother me.\n\n  \nI am not asking anyone to diagnose, but I am trying to figure out if this sounds more like irritation from friction or a reaction to something in my routine, and how to reset without making it worse.\n\n  \nCurrent routine:\n\nAM: gentle cleanser, lightweight moisturizer, sunscreen.\n\nPM: gentle cleanser, moisturizer. 2 to 3 nights a week I use an exfoliating acid (I stopped as soon as the burning started). No prescription products.\n\n  \nOther details: I have combo skin and usually get occasional breakouts on my chin, but not this texture and not the stinging. I have not changed detergents or toothpaste. The only new thing is the mask being on for 40 to 60 minutes at a time, sometimes when I am sweaty.\n\n  \nWhat would you do for a simple, cautious recovery plan? Should I strip it back to cleanser and moisturizer only for a while? Are there ingredients you would avoid while the burning is happening? Any tips for preventing this with masks (like timing skincare before putting it on) would also help.\n\n  \nThank you for any gentle suggestions.",

My face was itching and irritated, and I almost threw the bottles in the trash. But I decided to stick with it.\n\nNow, 25+ days in, the irritation is totally gone.

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

      "content": "title is my question in a nutshell. i unfortunately have fine curly hair, this is my routine:\n\n1. wash like once a week with l'real elvive hyaluron plump 72 hour hydrating shampoo (i honestly just grabbed this kind of at random a long time ago, but recently bought the Camille Rose guava slip detangling shampoo to try)\n2. comb through and use Shea Moisture Jamaican black castor oil strengthen &amp; restore leave-in conditioner after washing or wetting my hair\n3. deep condition once a week after washing with Argan Oil from Morocco Intensive Conditioning Treatment\n4. style with the bounce curl brush and AG Re-Coil Curl Activator, Argan Oil Style &amp; Shine Foaming Mousse, and a gel over that. i was using Not Your Mother's Frizz Control Sculpting Gel #3, but found it to be not quite enough hold, so starting using 4U by Tia's Strong Hold Gel and it's honestly a bit too much and very thick, so i'm in the market for a new gel i suppose. AG's Re-Coil Curl Activator has been a game changer, so i've been wanting to try their gel mousse but haven't found at a store near me yet.\n5. after styling i blow dry my hair to probably, realistically, about 40-50% dry with Infiniti Pro Conair Hair Dryer + diffuser attachment. even with the strong hold gel, that's about as much as i can blow dry it without introducing frizz (sob).\n6. i sleep with a Moonstone 7 satin sleeper hair bonnet on (it was about $70 but i am an extremely restless sleeper and it almost always stays on my head the whole night through) and silk pillowcases underneath that.\n7. on day 2 hair, i use the Infiniti PRO by CONAIR Steam Therapy Hair Steamer + diffuser attachment to spruce up my curls a little bit, then rub a bit of Re-Coil Curl Activator with water between my hands to scrunch and set.\n\n\n\nif you have fine curly hair and are still with me after all that, i desperately want to know if only making it two days without having to wash/re-wet is normal for you. by the end of day two my hair is so tangled and frizzy that i don't dare let it go any longer without re-wetting and detangling, and i always lose a big ol handful of hair doing it. if that's normal for most people with fine curly hair i can live with it, but if it's a matter of better products, what should i try?\n\ni also know that hair is more easily damaged when wet and it's not great to always have to re-wet it in order for it to look good, because you can get trapped in a vicious cycle of \"it only looks good when I re-wet it\" --&gt; rewetting it --&gt; it gets more damaged because of the time it spends wet and looks worse dry, making you think you need to re-wet it--&gt;ad infinitum.\n\nsimilar question about blowdrying. if you have fine curly hair, are you actually able to blow dry it 100% dry without introducing frizz? do i need a better blowdryer? stronger gel? my hair takes forever to dry the other 50-60%, and i hate how it looks stuck to my head while it's still in the gel cast during this time. i feel like a drowned cat.",

It's been about 5 weeks now since I've stopped any actives whatsoever and have focused on only four products:  \n  \nAM: wash face with water -&gt; CeraVe Hydrating Moisturizer -&gt; Eucerine Oil Control Dry Touch SPF 50+ (tinted)  \nPM: CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser -&gt; CeraVe PM niacinamide cream\n\nSo far in those 5 weeks the skin has been doing way better than it did during the SA purge. My breakouts are diminishing and the pimples that are coming up now are mostly surface level and they disappear quickly, about 1-2 days for them to drain and flatten. \n\nHowever, my face experiences constant sensory activity in the areas where I had the most inflammation - cheeks, folds of nose, temples and forehead. It doesn't matter whether it's day or night, pre skin care routine or after, I have some tingling feeling, phantom itches in spots where nothing is happening, sometimes slight burning, though it's not as hot, just the sensation resembles burning. Upon reading up online it seems these are normal symptoms of a recovering skin barrier, however I am wondering how long these persist and I'm a bit afraid they will transition into inflammation again. \n\nThe skin doesn't seem to be flaky or dry, quite the opposite, it looks nourished and upon touching it, it seems soft and supple. Perhaps this is also the reason why the breakouts are going away so quickly...\n\nHas anyone also experienced this?\n\nI used SA for 9 weeks daily, then tapered down to 3x a week for another 6-7 weeks and discontinued it completely 5 weeks ago.",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I'm looking for some insight before my dermatologist appointment tomorrow. The Backstory: About 2 years ago, I \"nuked\" my skin. I was stupidly using a high-strength AHA/BHA 25% peel and Retinoids at the same time. I'm certain I broke my skin barrier because I developed insane cystic acne immediately after. Current Situation: The \"Hard\" Acne: I have deep, cystic-like lumps that have been present for 2 years. They have become hard to the touch and haven't budged or come to a head.\n\nNew Breakouts: I'm still getting new acne in the same areas. Texture/Scars: I have significant PIH (dark marks), PIE (red marks), and what looks like ice-pick scarring. Current Routine: For the last 2 years, I've stopped all actives. I only use Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. Spf sunscreen. Location: I'm currently in Delhi and using tap water to wash my face. I suspect the hard water/chlorine might be making things worse.",

      "content": "M22 with oily skin.\n\nAbout 2 to 3 years ago, I absolutely loved this cleanser when Minimalist was still an independent brand. Back then it worked extremely well for me. It helped clear acne, controlled sebum, gave my skin a healthy glow, and most importantly, it never dried my skin out. I was using it along with a few other Minimalist products, and my skin was honestly in great condition.\n\nI eventually got lazy and stopped doing skincare for a while. A few days ago, I decided to restart my routine and went back to this cleanser since it used to be my go to product.\n\nBut now it feels completely different. It is drying out my skin much more than before and just does not feel the same overall. My skin feels tight and slightly irritated, which never happened with the older version.\n\nSince Minimalist was acquired by Unilever, I am wondering if the formulation has been changed.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this cleanser feeling more drying or different recently?",
