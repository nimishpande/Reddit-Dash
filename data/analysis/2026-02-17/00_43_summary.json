I did go to hair school but i don't even look in the mirror, I'll be sitting on the couch or in the office and feel a bad section, just snip it off. Ive had a section here or there that is a bit shorter, but the curls usually hide it really well. I always over direct and do almost a 180 angle for the top of my head to give a really nice round cut. \n\n\nRoutine:\nShampoo: curl smith frizz control cleanser \nConditioner: curl smith essential moisture / or raw sugar grow pro \nStyling: depends in day, curl smith 3 in 1 oil to cream, curl smith jelly shine gel, curl smith shine oil, curl smith curl revitalizer \n\nShampoo every 2-3 weeks. Condition depending on how much product i feel in my hair. I only get my hair wet in shower maybe one a week or week and half. Otherwise misting all over! Once i get out of the shower i tshirt dry and been using the Bounce Curl brush (which I love) or just finger curling it. Then air dry ! I only use blow drier off I'm in a hurry but if I'm doing a full style I'll make sure i have the day ",

      "content": "Originally posted in r/malegrooming and was told I should keep my curly hair, so I wanted to ask here for advice on how to maintain and style it properly.\n\nOver the past year I’ve been trying to improve myself, oing to the gym, dressing better, getting out more, etc. I’ve definitely grown in confidence, but I still feel self-conscious about my hair. I’ve always felt unsure about my hairstyle, especially because I think my nose is on the bigger side and I worry my curls make my features stand out more instead of balancing my face. My photos I posted go from last night (first 3) to this morning before water (4-6) to after water at 7-8\n\nI’d really appreciate honest advice on how to better define my curls\n\nReducing frizz\n\nWhether a different cut would suit my face better\n\nHow to maintain volume without it puffing out\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nShampoo: Not Your Mother’s Curl Defining Shampoo\n\nConditioner: (none currently)\n\nStyling: I’ve only tried using water in the morning to restyle\n\nDrying: I let it air dry\n\nhair protection: none \n\nmy routine\n\njust water in the morning\n\nRight after washing it looks decent, but by morning it pushes outward and gets frizzy. When I try to restyle with water, it just expands more instead of defining.\n\nI’ve never really had a structured routine before, so I’m open to product suggestions, technique advice, haircut recommendations, or anything else that could help.\n\nThanks in advance.",

It’s not smoother, and my pores look the same.\n\nRight now I’ve kind of paused because I don’t know what to try next. I don’t want to keep throwing random products at my face if they’re not actually helping.

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nEvery year when spring and summer approach, I think about cutting my hair. I got it cut to around my armpits back in March ‘25, and right now, it’s touching my tailbone, so I’m ready for a cut. I was thinking about getting a shag the last time I got my hair cut, but I wasn’t sure my hair texture was right for it, so I went for my regular longer layers with face framing pieces. Pictures 1-4 are of my hair now. \n\nThe reason I feel like I may not have the right hair texture for a shag is because every picture I see when I search shag haircuts have people with wavier/curlier hair than mine. My hair is naturally wavy, but the waves are larger and don’t start until after my ears. If I add product, it will hold more shape, but since I have fine hair strands, it’s been tough finding something that won’t make my hair frizzy/tangly.\n\nI’m looking to get shorter layers at the top with a more textured/razored finish (like pictures 5… but longer &amp; 6). As for my bangs, I like to keep them covering my forehead in a slightly inverted “V” shape with the shortest part of my bangs in the middle and they taper longer outwards on the left and right side. I am not interested in curtain bangs or anything longer that will be in my eyes (it’s a sensory nightmare for me). So the question is, do you think my hair texture is suitable for a shag with short layers at the top? Part of me thinks that if my hair weighed less, I would see more defined waves, but I am unsure. I’m looking for any helpful advice. Thanks!",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I live in germany and my doctor put me on 20% azelaic acid bc she said i have a light form of rosacea. But to me they dont behave like rosacea flushes, i do get light flushes sometimes but it doesnt affect the actual red spots. Is it just red pimple marks? I never had problems with severe acne, just normal breakouts.\n\nAt night i only use the azelaic acid atm and in the morning i use a glycerin serum with a spf. Sometimes i used nianciamide but right now i kinda want a clean slate and let my skin react to the azelaic.\n\nWhat do you guys recommend? Microneedling should be the last option bc i do not have the money atm to try every single thing in the world :(",

I started highlighting it in high school and have been doing it since (32 now). I love lightening my hair up. I always end up not going in more than twice a year though (due to cost and dont want to damage my hair too much). \n\nJust wondering some advice. Are highlights still the best option for me? Or maybe just not get them as light so it blends in better later? Or is there another option like the balayage that would be better?\n\nI posted 2 photos of times I had fresh highlights and now recent pics of how it is now 😬 (been 9 months now). I want to come up with some kind of routine that will work for me. \n\nAnd do you think I look better in the blonder hair or how would darker look? And long or short? Just wondering people's thoughts. Thanks so much. ",

      "content": "I have curly hair, more loose/thick curls than tight (definitely not wavy tho), but in texture very fine, which I think is causing me most of my issues. Its about shoulder length, and my haircut has a lot of layers. I used the season 5 nancy wheeler haircut as a reference for my most recent salon visit if that helps lol. \n\nOn days that I wash my hair, it usually comes out fine, no major complaints. But the next day, my hair is a mess. It is frizzy, the curls are a mix of totally straight and pitiful waves, my bangs look awful and flat, and it looks and feels greasy. My bangs and the length of my hair are usually clearly two separated chunks as well. It looks just awful. One day later! In the past couple weeks, I’ve tried shampooing my hair on that second day, and that's kind of hit or miss. In the past it hasn't worked, but lately I've been getting more success from it. I have no idea why as I haven't changed anything lol but that's just the way it goes with my hair. \n\nMy concern now is that I am really close to getting a new job that would require a long commute three days of the week, meaning I won't have much time in the morning to wash my hair. I would like to switch to washing my hair in the evening, but I have yet to find a successful way to arrange my hair while I sleep without it coming out like I described earlier.\n\nI've tried a silk bonnet, which keeps it smooth but flattens the curls, I've tried the pineapple method, which doesn't do well with my layers, and I think it contributes toward straightening out the length of my curls by pulling them, and I've tried the bonnet and the pineapple combined. Nothing works. \n\nHere’s my wash routine: \n\nEvery other day, I shampoo and condition my hair with Cantù brand shampoo and conditioner, and comb my hair in the shower after I condition. After getting out of the shower, I comb my hair again, then use Cantù brand mousse, and scrunch it into my hair w head upside down. I plop dry w a t shirt for usually thirty minutes or longer, as I’ve found the longer I plop the better it comes out. After unplopping, I have to let it sit and air dry for a little bit before I use a diffuser, scrunching it up with my head upside down. Usually this process is fine.\n\nI don't have any styling products that I can use outside of the shower. I had a gel that I used but I found it to just weigh my hair down more. \n\nAny tips would be greatly appreciated! I am new to learning how to handle my curly hair and I am sick of looking like a rat that got dragged through the gutter every other day of the week. Thank you !! ",
