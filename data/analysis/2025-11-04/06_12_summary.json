My curl routine is first I shampoo with Aussie miracle moist and wash just my roots. Then I rinse and usually use a hair mask instead of normal conditioner because my hair seems to struggle to keep moisture, the mask I use is shea moisture intensive hydration masqe. After brushing that through my hair I let it sit while I wash my body etc, when my hair is rinsed out and now soaking wet I detangle with a curl detangling brush and brush before applying Marc Anthonys curl envy cream, then I brush again to make curl clumps and scrunch in some eco gel. After the eco gel i spray in some leave in conditioner by Marc Anthony. Finally! I pray hands in some shea moisture curl mousse and plop for 10 minutes in a microfiber towel before diffusing for about 50 minutes.. also It seems I can never get the back to look as defined as the front. Last time I got a haircut was about 9 months ago. My hair rarely even gets past day 2 despite wearing a silk bonnet using the pineapple method to bed😅",

Sometimes it feels like it tangles *as I'm detangling it in the shower*, I'd run my fingers through detangled areas and they'd already feel tangled again. I want my hair to remain in shape and obey gravity rather than poofing up (the individual hairs are extremely thin). And I don't want to expel *all* of my energy to do it and waste *all* of my money on just conditioner, as it takes me 40 minutes to shower *without detangling*, an hour with, and I have to use about half a bottle of conditioner per shower because of how much hair I have, how dense it is, and how hard it is to make sure everything is fully covered between the curls. I would really like to have some advice.\n\nAs for my routine, I usually use either \"conditioner for normal hair\" or \"clay conditioner\", although I do experiment with different conditioners too. But those two are the ones that have made detangling my hair the easiest. I usually use either \"clay shampoo\" or \"shampoo for curly hair\", but again I occasionally buy different types to experiment. I have looked for sulfate-free shampoos and products intended for detangling and felt little improvement. The brands are nothing special, just the ones I find in grocery stores and pharmacies. I wash every 2-4 days. Sometimes just conditioner and sometimes with shampoo as well, depending on how itchy my scalp feels. Sometimes I even do conditioner first to detangle, then shampoo, then conditioner again to soften. If my hair feels too tangled, I detangle it by brushing it with a handheld brush while the conditioner is still on (only way I'm able to brush at all), starting at the tips and working my way up to the scalp inch by inch. I occasionally detangle with my fingers instead but it's usually less efficient, more painful and feels like it results in more hairs falling off than with the brush. I usually wrap my head in a towel to soak most of the water then leave it to air dry the remaining moisture. I've tried just rubbing my hair quickly instead of wrapping, and I've tried using an old shirt for either one instead of a towel, the end result after fully drying looks the same. I don't use any leave-in products, as most of them give me sensory issues, make my scalp itchy, and/or make my hair look even worse. I do have spray serums that I use sometimes, and they have done the best job of slowing down the overpoofing of my hair and maintaining its oobedience to gravity, but they also accelerate getting itchy and needing shampoo again.\n\nAlso important to note: I have had chemical straightening before. I had even less of an idea of how to take care of my hair, so threw years ago I had a chemical straightening. A year later, two years ago, I had it renewed and it was botched and didnt stick, and even the attempt to fix it was imperfect and didn't last as long. I have since cut all the parts from the first straightening and grown out new roots, but I imagine I still have some damaged tips at the top layer of my hair.",

I used the Equal Berry Swimming Pool toner for about 4 months, but it didn’t make much of a difference. I’m now on my third month of using the PC 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid, but again, I haven’t seen much improvement.\n\nWhat’s worse is that whenever I apply sunscreen, my skin texture looks even more noticeable, and since my face gets really oily throughout the day, that makes its even worse . I did some research and found that lactic acid is supposed to be stronger than mandelic acid, but I also came across recommendations to try pairing azelaic acid with niacinamide instead.\n\nDo you have any advice?

Normally, I have combination skin, with only a few breakouts on my chin whenever I'm hormonal and some blackheads and enlarged pores. Ever since I moved across country three weeks ago, though, my skin has been an absolute nightmare. It's flaky to the point that makeup looks patchy and my skin feels like it's ripping, yet i have massive breakouts and huge pimples along my cheekbones and forehead. With my limited funds, I've updated my skincare routine, but still my skin is flaking off and in pain. I'm hoping you guys might be able to make recommendations based off of my routine of what I could add or change in order to get this under control, it is painful and making me so insecure!\n\nMorning Routine: •Cleanse with Paula's Choice Resist Cleanser •Use prescribed Clindamycin wipes •Versed Milky Hydration Toner •ELF Holy Hydration Moisturizer w/ SPF\n\nNight Routine: •Cleanse with Paula's Choice Resist Cleanser •2x a week I exfoliate with the Versed Microcrystal exfoliator on these nights i simply just tone after and use moisturizer •3x a week I use prescribed tretinoin •Versed Milky Toner •First Aid Beauty Hydration Night Cream\n\nPlease let me know if there are any substitutions for what I use that may be better for my flaky skin and subsequent breakouts!!

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
