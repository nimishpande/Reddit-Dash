I went in asking for blonde highlights, but she said she could easily refresh the black in my hair too without a problem. The end result was gray all over my hair and after I pointed it out, she said “yeah that happens” but she didn’t tell me that was going to happen until after it did. Also the blending at the tops doesn’t look great either, but I don’t know if i’m just being picky. The original base charge before going in was $250, but I left paying $494 dollars. Is it acceptable to ask for a refund or at least a partial refund? ",

Usually over the years i have stopped and restarted a few times, and every single time I had to deal with shedding for a few months but then always after the 4-5 month  the hair always bounced back stronger.\n\nSo this time i was silly and thought that i have been consistent for so long and maybe my results will hold up without the meds. Well today is almost 5 months ago i stopped and what i hoped would not happen happened. Major shedding and hair that is thin and look like a diffuse baldy person\n\nSo lesson learned:  this is a lifetime medication, guys.

I shaved my head and tried getting on Finasteride 1.25 and minoxidil foam 2 times a day with micro needling 2 times a week. \n\nDidn’t feel any of the side effects, and it seemed like my hair was improving and i noticed almost no hair falling when running my hands through my hair. \n\nAround late august to september i noticed increased hair falling, i don’t know if that was like a second shed but most probably was caused by me being on holidays for like 3 weeks and sometimes missing applying minoxidil. \n\nIn October it seemed like it was getting better, got the density back and till now theres very minimal hair shedding. \n\nPlease note that in the last picture my hair is the longest i’ve probably let it grow ever, so the results might a bit misleading.\n\nOverall quite happy with the results, i didn’t document my hairline unfortunately but it is not too bad. \n\nI wanted to ask opinions on products i should be applying to my hair, maybe rosemary oil or something that would maybe make my scalp more healthy, if you have any suggestions please let me know :)\n\nAny idea if i should be expecting more growth or will i be able to maintain it like this(very happy with current state).\n\n",

I have really thick curly (probably) heat damaged hair from when I used to flat iron my poor curls, i've been wearing my hair curly for about a year now and I still feel like my hair hasn't reached its full\npotential yet no matter what I do it feels big and dry and feels like straw 🥲 oh to have shiny soft curls. My curl routine is first I shampoo with Aussie miracle moist and wash just my roots. Then I rinse and usually use a hair mask instead of normal conditioner because my hair seems to struggle to keep moisture, the mask I use is shea moisture intensive hydration masqe. After brushing that through my hair I let it sit while I wash my body etc, when my hair is rinsed out and now soaking wet I detangle with a curl detangling brush and brush before applying Marc Anthonys curl envy cream, then I brush again to make curl clumps and scrunch in some eco gel. After the eco gel i spray in some leave in conditioner by Marc Anthony. Finally! I pray hands in some shea moisture curl mousse and plop for 10 minutes in a microfiber towel before diffusing for about 50 minutes.. also It seems I can never get the back to look as defined as the front. Last time I got a haircut was about 9 months ago. My hair rarely even gets past day 2 despite wearing a silk bonnet using the pineapple method to bed😅",

      "content": "The first picture is how my hair looks after I wash it and after it has fully dried. The second picture is how my hair looks less than 48 hours of not washing it later. I am genuinely feeling so hopeless that my hair can look any good for more than 12 hours. It tangles up so fast. Sometimes it feels like it tangles *as I'm detangling it in the shower*, I'd run my fingers through detangled areas and they'd already feel tangled again. I want my hair to remain in shape and obey gravity rather than poofing up (the individual hairs are extremely thin). And I don't want to expel *all* of my energy to do it and waste *all* of my money on just conditioner, as it takes me 40 minutes to shower *without detangling*, an hour with, and I have to use about half a bottle of conditioner per shower because of how much hair I have, how dense it is, and how hard it is to make sure everything is fully covered between the curls. I would really like to have some advice.\n\nAs for my routine, I usually use either \"conditioner for normal hair\" or \"clay conditioner\", although I do experiment with different conditioners too. But those two are the ones that have made detangling my hair the easiest. I usually use either \"clay shampoo\" or \"shampoo for curly hair\", but again I occasionally buy different types to experiment. I have looked for sulfate-free shampoos and products intended for detangling and felt little improvement. The brands are nothing special, just the ones I find in grocery stores and pharmacies. I wash every 2-4 days. Sometimes just conditioner and sometimes with shampoo as well, depending on how itchy my scalp feels. Sometimes I even do conditioner first to detangle, then shampoo, then conditioner again to soften. If my hair feels too tangled, I detangle it by brushing it with a handheld brush while the conditioner is still on (only way I'm able to brush at all), starting at the tips and working my way up to the scalp inch by inch. I occasionally detangle with my fingers instead but it's usually less efficient, more painful and feels like it results in more hairs falling off than with the brush. I usually wrap my head in a towel to soak most of the water then leave it to air dry the remaining moisture. I've tried just rubbing my hair quickly instead of wrapping, and I've tried using an old shirt for either one instead of a towel, the end result after fully drying looks the same. I don't use any leave-in products, as most of them give me sensory issues, make my scalp itchy, and/or make my hair look even worse. I do have spray serums that I use sometimes, and they have done the best job of slowing down the overpoofing of my hair and maintaining its oobedience to gravity, but they also accelerate getting itchy and needing shampoo again.\n\nAlso important to note: I have had chemical straightening before. I had even less of an idea of how to take care of my hair, so threw years ago I had a chemical straightening. A year later, two years ago, I had it renewed and it was botched and didnt stick, and even the attempt to fix it was imperfect and didn't last as long. I have since cut all the parts from the first straightening and grown out new roots, but I imagine I still have some damaged tips at the top layer of my hair.",

I don't really have much of a routine right now, other than CeraVe SA face wash and turmeric soap which kind of burns after use. I would also like to note that i believe my skin is somewhat sensitive (Ive avoided using Benzoyl Peroxide after it badly burned and irritated my skin when I was first directed to use it, and only use the Turmeric soap once at night).

So I have always had naturally oily hair and will shampoo and condition every 2-3 days. The last few years I have been getting bad dandruff. Now I have oily hair on top of a dry scalp and it's driving me crazy. On top of that, I am losing a lot more hair then normal! I had a baby over 2 years ago and lost a lot of hair in postpartum but it hasn't went back to normal. I used to have long thick hair, but I recently cut it shoulder length as it's just driving me crazy and discouraging to see it thinning out. \nSo I'm wondering if there are any shampoo/conditioners/treatments that would be recommended for my hair type. I want my long thick hair back!\nI should also mention that I'm not in a position  currently to be spending hefty amounts on products, so drugstore options would be ideal for now!! \nThanks so much!!",

I have dry, sensitive skin.\n\nPersonally I think my evening routine is too long. I don't think I will repurchase the skin1004 serum, since I already have niacinamide in a few other products and vitamin c and retinol to help with hyperpigmentation. That serum contains tranexamic acid as well however, so I will be missing that in my routine. I definitely don't want to get rid of the two cleansers, the peptide serum, the daily innisfree retinol (0.015%), and the purito cream. I think the separate retinol serum (haruharu in this case) is necessary as well because I don't want to apply a stronger retinol on a daily basis. I definitely want an oil as well and a second moisturizer, besides the purito cream. So basically, I think the only way I can make the evening routine shorter is by finding a moisturizer with vitamin c and/or (a significant amount of) ceramides, and an oil with vitamin c and/or ceramides. Any suggestions?",

That could have been from the birth control I was on though. I stopped birth control in December and Accutane in April, and since then my mood has been better and my skin mostly clear.\n\nLately I’ve developed texture on my forehead and chin, and small whiteheads on my nose. Before Accutane, most products broke me out, especially moisturisers. I’ve been using The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Beta Glucan since starting Accutane and had no problems until recently, but I’m starting to think it’s possibly causing my issues. I stopped applying it to my forehead, chin, and nose, which helped for a bit, but I’ve broken out again this week.\n\nMy dermatologist said I could either go back on Accutane or try a cream. I didn’t want to risk feeling low again, so I chose the cream, Differin (Adapalene 1mg/g). He told me to use it as a spot treatment, but I’ve heard it isn’t very effective when used that way. I’ve tried Adapalene and Tretinoin before when I was younger and didn’t notice much improvement.\n\nNow I’m not sure whether to continue searching for a new moisturiser, go back on a low-dose of Accutane, or use Differin as a spot treatment.

My college is in Hyderabad, where the weather is usually dry  and my skin is perfectly fine there, more on the normal to slightly dry side.\n\nBut every time I go to Bombay for internships (where my family also stays), my skin completely changes. It becomes extremely oily, sweaty, and sticky the moment I step out. Since I’m constantly running around in formal clothes for court/office, by noon my skin looks super shiny, dull, sticky and just... disheveled. Like not the glowy kind of oily, it's the tired, heavy, “why does my face feel like it’s melting” kind. And it feels uncomfortable ngl\n\nI’ve tried blotting papers, which help for a while but even after that my skin feels heavy and sticky for some reason. I also tried the Innisfree No Sebum Powder, but it made my skincare kind of pill (that weird rolling feeling on the skin), and I hate that texture.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\n\nMorning:\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. L’Oréal Revitalift Serum\n3. L’Oréal Revitalift Hyaluronic Acid Cream\n4. Dot and Ket Watermelon Sunscreen\n\n\nNight:\n\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n2. Earth Rhythm Serums (I alternate between the CLEAR SKIN SERUM and 10% NIACINAMIDE SERUM)\n3. Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer\n\n\nI don’t wear makeup daily, maybe just sunscreen and Etude water tint. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, but my skin just hates Bombay weather. Is it the humidity? My routine? Any product or routine adjustments that could help?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice, I’m tired of looking like a greaseball by lunchtime 😭",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
