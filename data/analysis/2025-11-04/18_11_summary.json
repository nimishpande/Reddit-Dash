So I picked up the can and looked into the tube and I thought I saw more.\n\nSo I sprayed a little into the sink...like 6 to 8 dead fucking flies came out, I shit you not. I don't ever see any flies in my house, I am a clean mfer. But I also, usually right after a shower, apply the foam directly from the can right into my hair. And I leave the cap off the bottle. So...I've probably been applying dead flies to my hair every day for years after showering.\n\nApparently they like the ethanol in the foam formulation. I've never felt so grossed out. I don't know where the fuck got in from, but...never again.\n\nSorry you had to read this.",

      "content": "A while ago, I read a comment from a Mexican woman living in Paris.\nShe said that since moving to France, her hair had never been this short, not because she wanted to cut it, but because French hairdressers always insist on trimming.\nShe realized how in France, every visit ends with “your ends are too dry, we have to cut”, and it made her lose the motivation to even go anymore.\n\nShe explained that in Mexico and latin America in general, women place huge importance on their hair, which seems to be traditionally seen as a symbol of femininity and sensuality. \nThat resonated with me because I’d love to proactively care for my hair, instead of constantly cutting it like burned grass, also, curly cuts cost 3x the price of a regular haircut in France and I’m never happy with them. My curls are fine for me, I just would love them to grow longer, and it feels stupid trying to achieve it with what hairdressers recommend in Paris, hence, cutting a good 5-10cm of length to make it “grow longer and healthy”.\n\nSo, I wanted to ask Latin American curlies for their insights on this.\n\nWhat are your real, local secrets for healthy, long, shiny hair?\nNot the viral stuff like Skala while the whole world knows but the real insider things like traditionnal ingredients or rituals, local brands or products that actually work but aren’t famous abrod, habits or techniques that make the biggest difference for growth and softness, and also, how you deal with dryness and frizz in humid climates\n\nFor context: my hair is 2C+/3A, it hates hard water (calcium buildup) and breaks easily if I use too much protein.\nI’m trying to focus on health and length retention, no cuts for now \n\nMy routine is not locked, I change it from time to time according to the weather and period of the year and I’m willing to try different methods.\nLast wash day I used a clarifying shampoo + Nuxe Rêve de Miel rince conditioner + Flaxseed Gel on soaking hair + warm and then cold diffuser at 80% dryness + Davines Oi Oil to finish breaking the gel cast \n\nThank you so much if you take the time to share!",

After years of always blow drying and curling cause i never knew what to do with all the frizz and messylookingness. \n\nI went to the only curly hairstylist close to me that didn't charge literally not even exagerating $390 for a \"curly transformation cut\"\nThis woman charged me $75 and taught me what i needed to use, when and how my hair should be as I apply it. \n\nSince then ive kept experimenting and trying different products and order. I've been able to recreate these curls two days in a row! This is like day 3 or 4 curls. \n\nEven though it seems like so much product (im learning thats necessary for curly hair) my hair doesnt feel weighed down or like my curls fall. They feel super touchable and secure yet soft. Im super happy\n\n\nPRODUCTS USED AND ORDER:\n\nouidad spiral curls shampoo\n\nOuidad spiral curls Conditioner\n\nNot your mothers leave in (only apply once when my hair is drenched wet after wash) \n\nScrunch excess off with microfiber towel\n\nCurlsmith Airdry curl cream\n\nOuidad thermal control gel (decent ammount has been KEY) \n\nOuidad spiral curls mousse \n\nDiffuse just to form cast\n\nNot your mothers oil to scrunch out cast \n\n\nKristin Ess Texture spray (use lightly)- this has been KEY in keeping definition,  helped me feel like if i pull my curls or run my hands through it it just stays well and defined. Ill put my hair in a messy bun often and when taken down it looks just as good. \n\nAussie Flexible hold hair spray (suuuper light just for frizzy prone areas) \n\n\nRefresh: \n\nOuidad loose waves Curl activator or thermal control activator\nOuidad Gel\nOuidad mousse\nDiffuse \nOil\nTexture spray\n\n\n:)))\n\n\nIve just now gotten the Umberto Gianni gel and foam to try (i had already ordered them before I unlocked this combination) so im hoping I like them!",

I really liked it, but I realized my ends probably needed a trim because they were getting pretty frayed and it was bugging me. Well... I went a little overboard and cut more than I intended to and now I'm like \"shit how do I style this now?\"\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to style this mop while it grows out?\n\nEDIT: In terms of a hair routine, when it's cut this short I usually wet it every morning to kind of \"reset\" it from being smooshed overnight. I typically use Not Your Mother's line of curl products; as pictured, it just has some of the gel in it, but not a lot. Sometimes I'll use the curl cream, but I didn't for this picture because I'm out. I applied the gel, fingers through my hair and scrunching, while it was still wet and let the curls air dry.",

Occasionally I still get a small pustule, but nothing major anymore.\n\nA bit of background:\n\n\t•\tI never really had acne before — my skin was always clear.\n\n\t•\tEverything started after a few stressful weeks and almost no sleep.\n\n\t•\tAround that time I also used way too many new products (vitamin C, acids, etc.), and I think I damaged my skin barrier.\n\n\t•\tI had some cystic acne at one point, but that cleared on its own.\n\n\t•\tNow my focus is just to fade PIE and even out redness without causing new breakouts.\n\nMy current routine is super gentle:\n\nAM: just water + Eucerin DermoPure Hydra Repair Moisturizer\n\nPM: CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser → Neutrogena Hydro Boost Toner → Eucerin DermoPure Hydra Repair\n\nNo actives right now.\n\n👉 I’m thinking about introducing something mild to help with the redness and leftover marks — and I keep seeing people recommend:\n\n\t•\tAnua Azelaic Acid 10% (green bottle)\n\n\t•\tAnua Niacinamide + Tranexamic Acid Serum (red bottle)\n\nHas anyone here tried either of these for PIE or mild acne-prone skin?\n\n\t•\tDid they actually help fade redness?\n\n\t•\tAny irritation or purging?\n\n\t•\tWhich one would you recommend starting with?\n\n\t•\tOr is there another product that worked better for you?\n\nMy main goal: reduce redness and even out tone without triggering new breakouts.\n\nThanks a lot 🙏\n",

Underated Multipurpose Toning Solution – 8% Glycolic Acid + 1% Salicylic Acid + 1% GDL\n\n\n2. The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner\n\n\n3. WishCare AHA + BHA Body Lotion – 10% AHA blend + 1% Salicylic Acid + Niacinamide\n\n\n4. Dr. Sheth’s Lactic Acid Body Lotion\n\n\n\nMy goal: even out tan lines / fade dullness on arms &amp; legs (not face).\n\nIf you’ve tried any of these — which gave you the best visible results for tan removal or smoother skin?\nOr if there’s a pharmacy or derm-approved option that works better, please suggest 🙏\n\nWould really appreciate honest feedback (not influencer hype).\n",

Then lightly massage Simple Light moisturiser (has niacin in it) into damp skin. Then I add sweet almond oil mixed with a ceramide and amino acid moisturiser.\n\nThen I use an SPF50 garnier suncream. This isn’t designed for face but it’s the only thing in my routine that seems to reverse my fine lines! Anyone have a recommendation for a similar thick moisturiser that’s good but not too heavy?\n\n  \nEvening:\n\nWash with almond oil. Every couple days I’ll use a retinoid on dry skin, otherwise follow the same moisturisers on damp skin as daytime. Finally, use an antiwrinkle nightcream, and overlay with vaseline\n\nI used Hyaluronic acid for many many years and it didn’t really stop the dehydration\n\n  \nI’ve been drinking 2 - 3litres waters per day, taking occasional omega 3 supplement, for the past 3 months. Also been working on sleep hygiene, trying my best\n\n\n\nMy skin is better but does anyone have any advice? The lines look so terrible by the end of the day…",

The more I read, the more I realize how hard it is to figure out who to trust, what’s actually safe, and how to plan everything when you don’t speak the language.\n\nI went through something similar myself recently as a male trying to compare clinics, translate treatment names, and piece together Reddit reviews to make sense of prices. It honestly took me weeks.\n\nI’m now exploring an idea to make that process simpler, kind of like a concierge or guide that helps people from the U.S. plan their skincare or aesthetic treatments in Korea, but I’m still very early and mostly just trying to learn from real experiences.\n\nIf you’ve ever looked into or done skincare or plastic surgery in Korea, I’d love to chat for 15–20 minutes about how you researched, what was confusing, or what you wish existed.\n\nI'm also willing to offer to help you personally research clinics, pricing, and logistics for free as part of my learning process.\n\nIf that sounds okay, just comment or DM me. 🙏\n\nThanks in advance! Even a few thoughts or horror stories would be super helpful for me to understand where people get stuck.\n\n(Mods, totally fine to remove if not allowed. Just trying to do some firsthand learning.)",

      "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI (19F) have been using the Andalou Naturals 'Willow Bark Pure Pore Serum' for a long time but about a year or two ago they discontinued it. I called around and was able to stock up, but I ran out a couple months ago and I haven't found a good replacement. Any recommendations?\n\nI don't really do much to my skin and I don't want to change that. Other than the serum, I just use the Andelou 'Clear Skin Citrus Kombucha Cleansing Gel' whenever I shower (about every other day) and the Weleda 'Skin Food Light Nourishing Cream' in the winter when it's dry. I don't wear makeup, either.\n\nMy skin is pretty normal and I don't have many skin problems except some uneven texture and the occasional acne when I'm on my period (lol). However, without the serum my skin is getting more uneven, tough, and itchy, and nothing I've tried has helped.\n\nHere's the ingredients of the serum if it helps: Aloe Barbadensis Juice*, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel)*, Cyamopsis Tetragonolobus (Guar) Gum*, Fruit Stem Cell and BioActive 8 Berry Complex*, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Oil*, Lecithin, Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Extract, Salicylic Acid, Salix Alba (Willow Bark) and Spiraea Ulmaria (Meadowsweet) Extracts*, Olive Squalane, Zinc Gluconate, Camellia Sinensis (White Tea) Extract*†, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Phenethyl Alcohol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cinnamomum Camphora (Camphor) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) and Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Oils*.\n\nI appreciate any recommendations you can give me, I'm really out of my depth here.",

My routine includes washing 2x a week w/ miss jessie's conditioner + herbal esscence argan oil shampoo 2x. I also oil my hair with castor oil + rosemary (i understand castor oil is pretty heavy so i try and not use it constantly), i also use a muelle deep conditioning mask. I let that sit from 30mins-1hr. I then condition my hair and shampoo 2x: miss jessie's conditioner + herbal esscence argan oil shampoo. I then use a hair mask from amika: the kure, i then either use hair cream or a leave in, not your mother mousse and fenty hair gel. I constantly re wet my hair throughout this process, I then style my hair w/a denman brush, i then use a microfiber towel for a bit, and then finally diffuse. I also sleep with a silk pillow &amp; silk bonnet. Please help☹️",

I thought about doing keratin, but I don’t want it completely straight — I just want it kinda wavy, that’s it.\n\nAre there any light types of keratin I can use, and where can I find them?\n(Please don’t tell me “it’ll damage your hair” or “it’ll fall out” — I already know that. I’m cutting it off next year anyway for the army, so I just want some advice, that’s all.

The best shampoo I've used so far was Dr. Squatch but I mean it still didn't help. \nHere's my routine:\n1. Wash and condition with Shea moisture\n2. Add shea moisture curl cream and gel from ouidad though I just ran out so I need to buy a new one. \n3. Diffuse but I don't do it 100% because it'll literally take 2-3 hours. So I diffuse it like 70-80% \n4. Then I out this ghost oil on my hair. \n\nMy goal is for my hair to be tamed. \nGet this nice wet look going on but it dries up and it's so poofy. I don't mind a little poof but it just looks so bad. So dry. And again I don't know how to get rid of that bowl shape. I've been clarifying it with Neutrogena clarifying shampoo. I'll clarify twice a month. \nI take shower every other day but honestly I heard that's not good for curly hair so I'll use a shower cap and wash it twice a week instead. \nAny changes I should do? I've tried talking to curly hair specialist but they haven't been able to help me. ",
