It took me 3 years from picture 3 to 1. \n\nRoutine and tips:\n1. I used Davines and Kérastase products and they rehydrated my scalp and hair. \n2. Hair oil is a must. Heat protector also. \n3. I dry and style my hair using a difusor and finalize it with Davines oil usually \n4. Using a 100% cotton towel to dry my hair changed everything.

First 2 pics are wash day, 2nd two are next day. I don't break the cast. We'll see how the rest of the week goes. Got a long walk to an appointment tomorrow no idea what the weather is.\n\nRoutine this time was clarify, wash with curlsmith moisturizing shampoo, deep condition with amika (protein), rinse with cold water, redken acidic bonding 16%, chi thermal protectant, pretty curl girl strong hold gel, brush and then define and scrunch. I did add a tiny bit extra all over and the top right before diffusing.\n\nOh yeah and the cast sets quicker than the curlsmith souffle gel I was using. I wanted a cheaper price point and this new one is not cheaper but if it works better/longer then I will use less often and hopefully save money. It's concentrated so it says use less but I feel like I still used kind of a lot. Only comes in 100 or 250ml I think. Hopefully the place selling it restocks soon because it's like 30% off right now ;-;",

So, I've been experimenting with switching to the mild/gentle side of cleansers (the ones that claim to \"respect your skin barrier\"). \n\nAnd honestly? the difference hit me on day 3. No more that dry, squeaky feeling after washing. My skin actually feels normallll? Like I don't have to rush to slap on moisturizer immediately. \n\nApparently, these newer barrier -safe cleansers use things like ceramides, hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and other fancy humectants that keep your microbiome balanced (and I didn't even know we had one till last week).\n\nStill testing a few- Simple, Ponds, CeraVe, and this newer one that claims to have \"Vera-hyamino\" something. \n\nAnyone else switched to gentler facewashes lately??",

      "content": "Greetings you pretty curlies, this is my first post here, might be a bit long, please bear with me. \n\nIt's been a few years since I've graduated. My University was located in a damp, coastal region, so natural moisture wasn't a luxury there. That's also when I first found out I can grow wavy hair (bam!) and even curls after a certain length (double bam!).\n\nFast forward to now it's been one year since I moved back home (dry and dusty, arid desert climate) and I've witnessed much deterioration in my hair quality, feel and texture despite better, softer water supply. Which has also discouraged me to grow my hair beyond 6 months at a time. \n\nFor reference \nPics 1,2 &amp; 3: my hair from the time I was still studying for bachelor's, with minimal care (because a late teen living in hostel who barely knows about grooming, with lectures 6 days a week)\n\nPics 4&amp;5: my hair from the past month with a basic hair routine (rn I shampoo and use a leave-in conditioner on alternate days(due to excessive dust and heat around the city), sometimes use a normal conditioner-cum-heat repellent with the shampoo and occasionally use coconut or olive oil (once between 2-3 weeks))  \n\nBetween the years from then to now, I think I also let myself go and became somewhat indifferent to hair care, so that must've been another contributing factor to the damage.\nThis time thinking I'll grow them longer, went for a little trim yesterday, and I might be overthinking, but I think I got botched (will likely make a second post on that).\nAnyway, I'm finally turning to this community for advice to overcome the effect of an extreme change in climate and my own negligence. Thank you already if you've read so far!\n \nPS: I'd be grateful if someone can also tell me what my hair might be, I'm always stumped by that question for some reason. I've definitely got coarse, thick hair that become a dust catcher the moment I step out lol.",

      "content": "Hello everyone! As the title says i would love to get your thoughts on what foundation I should get from Sephora. (I don’t have sephora or anything high end where I live but im going to Greece next week, so I want to get one)..\n\nFor reference, for everyday use I use my Catrice True Skin Hydrating Foundation for everyday and it is one of my favorites and matches my skin tone perfectly (030 natural sand). I have some acne scars and sensitive acne prone skin, but mostly (knock on wood) it has gotten calmer and better over the past year or two, and now im working on resolving the last bit of acne left with my derm. That’s my little side rant sorry.\n\nBack to the point. For bigger events, last year i bought the Estée Lauder double wear foundation in 1W2 Sand. I love it. It is even more of a better match than the catrice one. However I find that it separates at the end of the night for me very often. Maybe because of my skin type. I have normal skin with it getting oily in my t zone sometimes. But mostly normal combo skin if that makes sense.\n\nSo I guess my question is. I want to get a foundation for big events that wouldn’t break me out (honestly i haven’t noticed any foundation breaking me out but i figured id mention that anyway), that is long wearing, not too heavy on the skin, but still gives full coverage and doesn’t separate or get cakey or patchy or separate on me over the night. I want to use it for special occasions like birthdays, weddings, work events etc because I love doing my own makeup. And I wouldn’t change my Estée Lauder if it didn’t separate on me but idk what to do. What do you guys recommend?\n\nI see very mixed reviews about the House labs foundation, and I have always wanted the one NARS foundation that the OG beauty gurus used back in the day.\n\nI would really appreciate if you would give me your holy grail full coverage, acne safe, beautiful and lasting foundation recommendations! Thank u so much in advance ❤️ I hope this wasn’t too long ago, sorry.. i only got one shot so i figured I would ask here",

I have been plucking the dark ones for years now with no issues, but about a year ago almost all of them started growing back as ingrowns.\n\nI have tried to just let them grow out to the surface, but one time a hair just REFUSED to come to the surface, and I developed a big bump and what I think was an infection around the area, so I ended up buying Tend Skin based on recommendations from Reddit, and used it on the area for about a week until the hair came close enough to the surface and, with a needle and tweezers, pulled out what must've been like a 2 inch hair (🤢🤢🤢), and the scar from the infection didn't go away for like 8 months so now I'm kind of too mentally scarred to just leave the ingrown hairs alone.\n\nEver since then, that has been my routine dealing with these ingrowns – gently pull the end of the hair to the surface with a tiny needle, pull it out with tweezers, use Tend Skin, then moisturize with an unscented, hypoallergenic lotion. I don't wear bras or tight clothing. But no matter what I do the hairs just keep ingrowing and I am growing more and more frustrated and it's honestly been affecting my confidence.\n\nI'm looking for suggestions, whether it's a product or something else (also, should I be concerned about any hormonal issues? I'm unsure if this amount of hair growth around my nipples is normal or if my hormones are out of whack.)\n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

However, I really just don’t know where to start. I’ve tried various methods (albeit using the same products) and it always comes out frizzy and messy, rather than defined neat curls.\n\nThese pictures were taken about an hour after hair washing. My routine was:\n\n-Washed hair with Tresemme repair shampoo once\n-Left tresemme conditioner in hair for about 5 minutes and then rinsed it out\n-Squeezed excess water out of hair, dried excess hair with micro fibre towel\n\n-let air dry for about 15 minutes \n-ran Tresemme Curls leave-in conditioner through ends and then blow-dried\n-ran Elive oil through hair (I don’t tend to do this but was told it would stop hair-clumping, which was an issue. Regardless it ended up more or less the same as without)\n\nThe result has, so far, always been a few nice curls which is ruined by extremely frizzy hairs and a lot of hair that just hasn’t curled properly. It leads to a sort of half-curled blob that looks more like an unkempt mess than anything nice.\n\nI’m aware I need a haircut too, but I’m unsure what I’d ask for, I want to promote curling and continue to grow out my hair but I don’t even know how to do that with product, let alone a haircut.\n \nAny help would be massively appreciated, I’d really love to have pretty, curly hair, and on the rare occasion I will get a very curly hair day, but I can never recreate it.",

I have only been on doxycycline and tretinoin for 2 weeks but it doesn’t seem to be making a difference and i still get frequent break outs and personally just hate my scars. it’s really demoralizing everyday to see so many people with clear skin who don’t even try and when I try 15 different skincare routines my skin comes out the same if not worse.
