It took me 3 years from picture 3 to 1. \n\nRoutine and tips:\n1. I used Davines and Kérastase products and they rehydrated my scalp and hair. \n2. Hair oil is a must. Heat protector also. \n3. I dry and style my hair using a difusor and finalize it with Davines oil usually \n4. Using a 100% cotton towel to dry my hair changed everything.

First 2 pics are wash day, 2nd two are next day. I don't break the cast. We'll see how the rest of the week goes.

I did add a tiny bit extra all over and the top right before diffusing.\n\nOh yeah and the cast sets quicker than the curlsmith souffle gel I was using. I wanted a cheaper price point and this new one is not cheaper but if it works better/longer then I will use less often and hopefully save money. It's concentrated so it says use less but I feel like I still used kind of a lot. Only comes in 100 or 250ml I think. Hopefully the place selling it restocks soon because it's like 30% off right now ;-;",

No more that dry, squeaky feeling after washing. My skin actually feels normallll? Like I don't have to rush to slap on moisturizer immediately. \n\nApparently, these newer barrier -safe cleansers use things like ceramides, hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and other fancy humectants that keep your microbiome balanced (and I didn't even know we had one till last week).\n\nStill testing a few- Simple, Ponds, CeraVe, and this newer one that claims to have \"Vera-hyamino\" something. \n\nAnyone else switched to gentler facewashes lately??",

      "content": "Hello everyone! As the title says i would love to get your thoughts on what foundation I should get from Sephora. (I don’t have sephora or anything high end where I live but im going to Greece next week, so I want to get one)..\n\nFor reference, for everyday use I use my Catrice True Skin Hydrating Foundation for everyday and it is one of my favorites and matches my skin tone perfectly (030 natural sand). I have some acne scars and sensitive acne prone skin, but mostly (knock on wood) it has gotten calmer and better over the past year or two, and now im working on resolving the last bit of acne left with my derm. That’s my little side rant sorry.\n\nBack to the point. For bigger events, last year i bought the Estée Lauder double wear foundation in 1W2 Sand. I love it. It is even more of a better match than the catrice one. However I find that it separates at the end of the night for me very often. Maybe because of my skin type. I have normal skin with it getting oily in my t zone sometimes. But mostly normal combo skin if that makes sense.\n\nSo I guess my question is. I want to get a foundation for big events that wouldn’t break me out (honestly i haven’t noticed any foundation breaking me out but i figured id mention that anyway), that is long wearing, not too heavy on the skin, but still gives full coverage and doesn’t separate or get cakey or patchy or separate on me over the night. I want to use it for special occasions like birthdays, weddings, work events etc because I love doing my own makeup. And I wouldn’t change my Estée Lauder if it didn’t separate on me but idk what to do. What do you guys recommend?\n\nI see very mixed reviews about the House labs foundation, and I have always wanted the one NARS foundation that the OG beauty gurus used back in the day.\n\nI would really appreciate if you would give me your holy grail full coverage, acne safe, beautiful and lasting foundation recommendations! Thank u so much in advance ❤️ I hope this wasn’t too long ago, sorry.. i only got one shot so i figured I would ask here",

My University was located in a damp, coastal region, so natural moisture wasn't a luxury there. That's also when I first found out I can grow wavy hair (bam!) and even curls after a certain length (double bam!).\n\nFast forward to now it's been one year since I moved back home (dry and dusty, arid desert climate) and I've witnessed much deterioration in my hair quality, feel and texture despite better, softer water supply. Which has also discouraged me to grow my hair beyond 6 months at a time. \n\nFor reference \nPics 1,2 &amp; 3: my hair from the time I was still studying for bachelor's, with minimal care (because a late teen living in hostel who barely knows about grooming, with lectures 6 days a week)\n\nPics 4&amp;5: my hair from the past month with a basic hair routine (rn I shampoo and use a leave-in conditioner on alternate days(due to excessive dust and heat around the city), sometimes use a normal conditioner-cum-heat repellent with the shampoo and occasionally use coconut or olive oil (once between 2-3 weeks))  \n\nBetween the years from then to now, I think I also let myself go and became somewhat indifferent to hair care, so that must've been another contributing factor to the damage.\nThis time thinking I'll grow them longer, went for a little trim yesterday, and I might be overthinking, but I think I got botched (will likely make a second post on that).\nAnyway, I'm finally turning to this community for advice to overcome the effect of an extreme change in climate and my own negligence. Thank you already if you've read so far!\n \nPS: I'd be grateful if someone can also tell me what my hair might be, I'm always stumped by that question for some reason. I've definitely got coarse, thick hair that become a dust catcher the moment I step out lol.",

However, I really just don’t know where to start. I’ve tried various methods (albeit using the same products) and it always comes out frizzy and messy, rather than defined neat curls.\n\nThese pictures were taken about an hour after hair washing. My routine was:\n\n-Washed hair with Tresemme repair shampoo once\n-Left tresemme conditioner in hair for about 5 minutes and then rinsed it out\n-Squeezed excess water out of hair, dried excess hair with micro fibre towel\n\n-let air dry for about 15 minutes \n-ran Tresemme Curls leave-in conditioner through ends and then blow-dried\n-ran Elive oil through hair (I don’t tend to do this but was told it would stop hair-clumping, which was an issue. Regardless it ended up more or less the same as without)\n\nThe result has, so far, always been a few nice curls which is ruined by extremely frizzy hairs and a lot of hair that just hasn’t curled properly. It leads to a sort of half-curled blob that looks more like an unkempt mess than anything nice.\n\nI’m aware I need a haircut too, but I’m unsure what I’d ask for, I want to promote curling and continue to grow out my hair but I don’t even know how to do that with product, let alone a haircut.\n \nAny help would be massively appreciated, I’d really love to have pretty, curly hair, and on the rare occasion I will get a very curly hair day, but I can never recreate it.",

A lot of things point to something different from DHT.\n\nI personally think we continue to get excited about new cures and treatments we stumble upon by accident like PP405, but for as long as we don’t start with basics will none of them work. \n\n",

Shampoo with Olaplex Bond Maintenance Shampoo (I have pretty short hair so I end up just distributing it evenly throughout all of my hair) and rinse\n2. Condition with Olaplex Bond Maintenance Conditioner, distributing evenly, leave in for a few minutes while I wash my body then rinse\n3. Put hair in a microfiber towel while I dry off\n4. Distribute around a nickel-sized amount of Pattern Leave-In Conditioner throughout hair\n5. Blow dry on medium heat and low fan speed.

I have only been on doxycycline and tretinoin for 2 weeks but it doesn’t seem to be making a difference and i still get frequent break outs and personally just hate my scars. it’s really demoralizing everyday to see so many people with clear skin who don’t even try and when I try 15 different skincare routines my skin comes out the same if not worse.

Been on minoxidil nearly 5 years and finasteride 4 years, completely consistent, the “gold standard” combo everyone says works if you start early. But I’m still thinning, crown and hairline both, and it just keeps creeping.\n\nI’m living proof of it, I’ve documented everything over the years with pics:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/1nthiqv/24\\_years\\_old\\_with\\_aggressive\\_hairloss\\_nearly\\_5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/1nthiqv/24_years_old_with_aggressive_hairloss_nearly_5/)\n\nWhen you start losing hair that young, it’s just different. The loss is usually way more aggressive, and it hits you during the years you’re supposed to be growing into yourself. Watching your hair vanish before you even hit your mid-20s wrecks your confidence, dating life, and mental health in a way that’s hard to explain to people who started at 35+. I used to be confident, genuinely. I never thought twice about how I looked, but ever since the balding started, I’ve never been the same. It messes with your head, you stop feeling like yourself, and your confidence just drains away. \n\nAnd the worst part? Treatments don’t even work as well. Your follicles are just too sensitive to DHT. You can block 70–90% of it, use minoxidil, microneedling, but once that genetic switch is flipped, you’re fighting a losing battle.\n\nI’ve even done a scalp biopsy (confirmed MPB only), blood tests. Nothing else going on. Just aggressive MPB.\n\nPeople say “get a transplant,” but what do you do when you’re still losing hair even on meds? You’ll just keep chasing the loss until you run out of donor. And young balders have decades ahead, by 35 you’re patchy again and can’t get more grafts.\n\nHair systems? Sure, they can look good, but the maintenance, cost, and constant fear of being outed are no joke. It’s trading one kind of stress for another.\n\nAnd the “cure is 5 years away” since the early 2000s? Never here, never ready. Realistically, there’s nothing truly effective coming anytime soon.\n\nSo yeah, I’m not trying to be negative for the sake of it. Just venting as someone who’s done everything right and still watching it all go. Young balders are honestly cooked.",

An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "\n\n[PSA] 25F here. Hi! I used the cocokind ceramide barrier serum Friday night. It’s now Sunday night but on that night the serum Completely burned my skin. Red splotches Everywhere and my entire face was beet red and in so much pain. I typically have good skin but I do have those little bumps that look like hidden acne that I never really figured out how to get rid of. I get pretty bad hormonal / cystic acne in my chin / jawline area during that time of month but because my periods been skipping, the acne in those spots haven’t really gone away.\n\nAs soon as the serum burned my skin in minutes I quickly washed with cold water and put my round lab birch juice moisturizing cream. Next morning I just rinsed with water and put the cream on again and repeated at night. I also in between sprayed my avene thermal spring water spray which I think had helped with the stinging. \n\nBecause I worked out in public the following day, that night I worked I did cleanse my face with the skin1004 cleansing oil and spray, then put on the birch cream again. I’ve now rotated to the cleansing oil, spray and drowning my face in the cicafilate + serum because I’m used to that one and I heard it’s more helpful at barrier repair. \n\nI have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and dry, and I never had such a terrible reaction to a product. My barrier is obviously damaged, but I don’t have funds to go to a derm. I was wondering what I could use to repair my barrier and if I’m doing anything wrong / right so far with my skincare since the burn? Do I need aquaphor? I’m not sure what to do.. my skin still stings throughout the day and I could tell at night the most red areas that burned most come back up around my cheeks… thanks! \n\nI have cystic acne under my chin / around my jaw line right now from the burn and I’m noticing little white heads. I picked at the cystic acne but I’m trying not to. I’ve never gotten cystic acne. What do I do? ",

I look so much older and rougher and I can’t stand the thing I see in the mirror. The severe dark circles and under eyes. Just everything. I do think my anemia is making the dark circles worse though. \n\nI aged five years in one year. I receive adequate sleep (8hrs). I wear spf whenever I leave home and sometimes when it’s really sunny I apply it when I’m at home. I wear a hat or take an umbrella with me most of the times. I’m using Tretinoin. I moisturize frequently. I don’t smoke or do drugs. I hydrate well. Yet…that person in the mirror still horrifies me. The image attached are the products I use. I don’t feel comfortable posting a picture of myself. I ask about aging because stress and illness ages people regardless of how old they are.\n\nPlease help me.
