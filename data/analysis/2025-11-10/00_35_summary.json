The back/top/center of my hair is also low porosity and does NOT hold water well and I always had trouble getting any definition there but now my hair is even with this product. First 2 pics are wash day, 2nd two are next day. I don't break the cast. We'll see how the rest of the week goes. Got a long walk to an appointment tomorrow no idea what the weather is.\n\nRoutine this time was clarify, wash with curlsmith moisturizing shampoo, deep condition with amika (protein), rinse with cold water, redken acidic bonding 16%, chi thermal protectant, pretty curl girl strong hold gel, brush and then define and scrunch. I did add a tiny bit extra all over and the top right before diffusing.\n\nOh yeah and the cast sets quicker than the curlsmith souffle gel I was using. I wanted a cheaper price point and this new one is not cheaper but if it works better/longer then I will use less often and hopefully save money. It's concentrated so it says use less but I feel like I still used kind of a lot. Only comes in 100 or 250ml I think. Hopefully the place selling it restocks soon because it's like 30% off right now ;-;",

A lot of things point to something different from DHT.\n\nI personally think we continue to get excited about new cures and treatments we stumble upon by accident like PP405, but for as long as we don’t start with basics will none of them work. \n\n",

It seems to provide at least some relief. But I have to use about 2-3 cups for the bath, which can become a bit pricey and it also has a smell I don't love.\n\nI have been wondering about substituting ACV with citric acid, since it has no smell and I'd likely use less of it.

I'll admit I'm pretty lazy, but nothing I do seems to help so I go low maintenance. \n\nOne major problem is that it stays curly in the back, but looses curl in the front (probably because I'm always messing with it or putting it behind my ears). I also have two cowlicks in the front, think devil horns, and a terrible hair line, so I never know how to part it. Also I sweat a lot along my hairline, so it gets messy very easily. Most days, if I even try to make it look nice, I'll end up putting it in a messy bun before 10am. \n\nRoutine below, but I'm hoping for any advice on how to care for my hair, daily styles that work with my mess, and fancier styles that might work.\n\nRoutine: \n\n1. Wash and condition with argan oil products\n2. Wrap with a microfiber towel\n3. OXG argan oil defining cream\n4. Air dry\n5. Usually sleep on it because I shower at night\n\nThanks to anyone that can help, I'm hopeless :/\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nt34rqs59b0g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3383c90f4120724fa840b258edd67770bbe3b450\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qx4pdqs59b0g1.jpg?width=1841&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af811688fdd8b1ebf9b24ba2d7ca25d897d3d01\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbrp7qs59b0g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2690cdfe38405338241a44dde34fc02a6e41ef1f\n\n",

      "content": "Current products:\n\nThe Ordinary 7% Glycolic Acid Toner\nNizoral ketoconazole shampoo\nMaui Moisture Lightweight Curls + flaxseed shampoo\nCurlsmith Multi-tasking conditioner\nVerb Ghost Oil\nNYM Curl Talk Cream (the one with protein)\nHarry’s Sculpting Gel\n\nRoutine:\n\nI wash my hair once a week. I use the glycolic acid on my scalp a couple hours before washing. First cleanse w/ the Nizoral and a shampoo brush, then the Maui Moisturizer. Follow up with the Curlsmith conditioner on mids and ends. Brush the Ghost oil and NYM curl cream on mids and ends, then the Harry’s gel. I scrunch my hair and diffuse 99% of the time.\n\nSkin history/additional info:\n\nThe flaking seems to be mostly concentrated towards my front hairline, but I do see some flakes everywhere else. My mom has said previously that it looks angry, and I have some red patches towards the front. I’m pretty confident it’s not fungal because my scalp produces very little oil. It takes a solid 5-7 days for it to get the slightest bit oily. Straight out of the shower I still see flakes, and I also notice them on my brush when I distribute the products. I’ve tried double cleansing with the Nizoral but I feel like it made it worse? I do have a history of eczema that was really bad when I was a kid, but not so much now. My whole body is just extremely dry and flaky. It’s to the point that I have to use lotion and oil twice a day otherwise I get flaky. I’ve also tried using jojoba oil before shampooing but it didn’t seem to help much.\n\nI’ve been thinking about trying an oatmeal rinse or mask since the Aveeno Colloidal Oatmeal Bath works wonders for the rest of my skin, but i’m not sure at what point I should use it or if it would even help. I’ve read about people using it before shampoo, in place of shampoo, or after conditioning.\n\nUnfortunately I’m not able to see a dermatologist at the moment because I’m a full time college student and the only place that accepts my insurance is an hour away.",

      "content": "hi!\n\nI'm sick and tired of my hair never looking anywhere similar the day after I shower ;(. I've tried a bonnet before but I think my personal issue is my hair gets under me while i sleep, flattening it. So, the bonnet doesnt help. My hair is thin and not that long so when I try to put it up to sleep in, the hair tie/scrunchie crushes it all, i guess. So, putting it up flattens it more basically. I have a satin pillowcase too.\n\nIn the picture I know my roots are also flat which I don't like. However, I'm trying to focus on one issue at a time (My hair flattening when I sleep) so I'm not worrying about that right now but I'll still take any advice. I think my hair is 3a. Also, my hair is still a bit wet from my shower in the picture but it looks like how it usually does after I shower by now (more or less)\n\nMy routine:  \n  \nShea moisturizer conditioner and shampoo. I brush my hair in the shower with the conditioner with a brush. After I shower, I use Carol's Daughter born to repair curl cream to brush my hair with my hands and then I do the ouidad method (idk if thats what people actually call it lol) and like \"flick\" my hair so it curls naturally. Then, I take the Curl Quencher ouidad gel and scrunch my hair with my hands. Then, I use a towel to continue scrunching.  \n  \nI just got a shea moisture mousse to try as I have thin hair and ive heard that mousse is better than gel for that reason. But I have used a different mousse before and i didn't see a difference between it and the gel honestly. I used the shea moisture mousse for the first time today. I let my hair air dry. \n\nI appreciate any advice! Thx in advanced\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ephttk8spa0g1.png?width=590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dd9bc354a5e9d67fd208e971a12446f0d363503\n\n",

I had great gain and thickening, followed by stopping my hair fall. Last september I added 1x 0.5mg dut to my 7x 1mg fin regimen. I even improved my hair thickness for 6 months. BUT I started to shed after the end of this 6 month.\n\nIn march 2025 I started to shed like crazy… This shed lasted until today, and still going. I tried to increase my dut dosage up to x2 and x3 with x7 fin per week but nothing changed.\n\nTo clarify, I do not use generic brands. Only propecia and avodart.\n\nSo, the question rises now: What should I do?\n\nA) Stop dutasteride fully because it gives damage (?) to my hair and only stick with finasteride. 9 month is already enough.\n \nB) 2-3x dut is not enough so increase it to ED.\n\nFor the option A,\nI do find it weird to be honest because some people say that I might not be responding enough to dut But dont forget, I have never stopped using 7x fin.\n\nCould you guys help me, or just share your ideas please? I am planning to see a doctor but they are generally useless since they are mainly not pro fin/dut in my country.\n\nI appreciate all the support \n\nBest",

My hair is a bit fine but I have a lot of it (every stylist is surprised the first time they get their hands on it hahah). I have curtain bangs and wavy hair that can get frizzy (especially after blow drying). I’m trying to learn and improve my blow drying skills but it is a bit of a struggle still). My stylist suggested wavy talk thermal brush. As I was looking on Amika’s site I saw there are 2 in 1 styling tools. Would be able to even use the 2 in 1 properly since o struggle as is to blow dry? Or if I blow dry poorly and it’s a bit poof-y and frizzy would the thermal brush will it be able to style my hair (I’ve noticed my hair looks much better, less frizzy, and holds the style a bit more when I style it after blowing vs blow drying alone) \n\nThere is also so many thermal brushes and 2 in 1 styling tools.

I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
