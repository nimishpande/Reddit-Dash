Goal wasn’t “most mentioned,” but “most positively talked about.”  \n(signal \n\nMethod in a nutshell:  \n– Scraped 90+ “best moisturizer?” threads &amp; skincare megathreads  \n– Ran GPT-5 + Gemini 2.5 to extract product names and classify sentiment  \n– Scoring = \\~70% positive vs. negative differential + \\~30% positive/total ratio  \n– Merged name variants so duplicates didn’t inflate scores (e.g., “CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,” “CeraVe tub” → one entry) + some other nerdy sentiment tweaks that I won't bore you with\n\nHow the signal Score is set: it’s a weighted mix of positive/negative sentiment, upvotes, and comment quality. Strong, highly upvoted praise counts more than low effort mentions (same for negatives), so it reflects how strongly Reddit favors a product, not just how often it’s named.\n\nWould love your feedback!

      "content": "I’m focusing on getting my curls healthy and bouncy after years of using damaging h.eat and heavy protein products, I’m finally finding what works for my hair type. \n\nIn the past I’ve been using h.eat on it ever since I was a kid to go to church or parties, without any protection oil ( the 90s), just damping h.eat from the h0t cur/ing ir0n. I got my first chemica/ re/axer at 12, which burned my scalp and caused a painful swirl of scabs and hair which was too painful to pull or comb. The things I’v done with my hair through the decades… But today a new day, a healthy way forward!\n\nIn 2024, I stopped using high h.eat, completely avoiding f/at ir0ns, and also quit co/oring my hair. At first, it made my hair look kinda worse, but thanks to these Reddit subs like this I think I’ve figured out part of the problem and the solution. Turns out I was overloading my curls with protein, and that just doesn’t work for my hair type anymore. Still figuring it all out, but I feel like I’m finally on the right track.\n\nWhen I used to si/k press my hair, I think it needed that superficial glow to look healthy, but wasn't, so I ended up using heavy coatings and lots of protein-based products. Now that I’ve stopped and don’t damp it in or anythin, the products just seem to sit on top of my hair instead of absorbing. I don’t really know the science behind it, but that’s what it feels like and look like.\n\nSo after a big clarifying wash this summer and switched products to light or none protein based product. I started washing with apple cider vinegar, only 1 time, I used way too much, because my hair looked scary dry. But I kept on using the new products and it’s already improved in just a couple of months and it feels like it is getting better with every wash.\n\nThe photos serie starts with my Day 7 hair  from last week, I was out and about, windy, traveling etc.\nSo when I got home I washed my hair when and kept my conditioner in overnight, too tired to style it. \n\nI documented the process, with a before &amp; after.\n\nI’m very much open to tips and advices!\n\n\n\n\n*Hair Routine + products in the photos \n\nProducts in order of use\n\nOnce a month Clarifying:\nGiovanni 50:50 Balanced hydrating clarifying shampoo.\nCurlsmith Mask Double Cream Deep quencher.\nRegular washing: 1 or 2 times a week\nKerastase Shampoo Curl Manifesto.\nKerastase Conditioner Curl Manifesto.\n\nStyling:\nGiovanni Curl defining Leave-in Curl Habit.\nGiovanni Curl shaping Gel Curl Habit.\nCurlsmith Frizz Rescue Curl Retainer.\nUmberto Giannini Boost Mousse Rosemary.\nMixed Chicks H.eat and Humidity protection serum.\n\nTools:\n-The Bounce curl brush  \n-Blow dryer diffuser with low h.eat and cold settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Hi everyone! \n\nI see on this subreddit SO many people complaining about how their progress is nonexistent while they have been on medication maybe a couple or few months. I want to share my progress to hopefully give some hope. \n\nI just recently went to the dermatologist again after half a year of not going to see what progress I had made and also to talk to him about it and see what opinions he had. \n\nI, too, was constantly on this subreddit at the beginning trying to look for answers to doubts that I had about either the medicine or my progress overall when I started. I obsessed over my progress pictures and was constantly frustrated that I did not see the progress I was expecting. I doubted the medicine I doubted the process and was repeatedly thinking that maybe this just wasn’t working for me. \n\nEven though all the doubts, I continued with the medication. Finasteride and minoxidil every single day. I started accepting that I had, believe it or not, after 9 months or so some results! And when the year came I think the results speak for themselves. \n\nThere were also a few aspects that I believe helped to have the hair I have now. I am way less stressed than last year and I sleep better. My blood pressure was terrible, so I worked on that and I brought it to normal levels. I exercise constantly and eat well and take vitamins for the hair. I did notice some side effects but there’s a part of me that thinks it was placebo effect. Regardless, I brought down the Finasteride dose form 1mg to .5mg and since then it’s been all good. \n\nI hope this helps you guys that are doubting. I’ve been there and I think we have all been there. Just keep going and trust the process. \n",

Its not the taste but the texture since i can drink it fine and some even taste good. Though i have been really lacking with drinking that so if that could have an effect (i do supplement things i could be lacking now)\n\nTopical-\ntret 0.1 twice a week(new)\nLaroche Pose gentle cleansing foam b5\nIlliyoon ceramide ato concentrate moisturizer\nisntree hylauranic acid sunscreen\nor BOJ sunscreen probiotic\n\nAlso i drink like 2 liters of water. Not necesserily well spread throughout the day though.\n\nand at night the same except no sunscreen and i use vaseline or aquaphor on my face.\n\nAlso i bought a cetaphil hydrating lotion a couple days ago and Inever knew you were really supposed to feel that instant hydration like that, but now ive got like 10 pimples so idk if that was the cause or the 2 weeks of tret or god knows what since I switch things quite alot. \n\nI was thinking Vit c but topical serum could be good?\nAnd orally like NAC or MSM?\nmaybe even sunbed or i'd go asfar as to say inject melanotan-2 \nOnly downside i can really find is some small sides but mainly the fact i'd have to inject it everyday i think. \n\nIve put 2 pictures for reference. The bad one after a day of school\nand the \"good\" one in \"indoors\" lighting when i wake up and do my skincare. It always go to shambles after some hours outside.\n",

It also is always SOO tangly too, to the point I have to just brush or I would be combing tangles out for over five minutes. When I treat it like “straight” hair without products I can easily brush through without force. For this wash day it was Davines OI Shampoo/Butter mask, then after on soaking wet hair I scrunched in JVN Air dry cream and let completely air dry before scrunching the crunch out. Some other routines I have tried were the same shampoo/butter mask instead of the air dry cream I will either use Herbal Essences curl mousse or Not Your Mothers gel or La Looks blue sports gel. I’ve also tried the same routine but diffuse with my Dyson and get the same results. I clarify regularly with either Suave clarifying shampoo or davines Solu shampoo. And I will sleep with a pineapple in a bonnet. I am not sure if my shampoo/conditioner is too heavy? But when I wear my hair “straight” aka just brushing it and using just leave in conditioner it won’t get oily fast or seem weighed down. ",

I started moisturizing regularly when I get out of the shower about 8 years ago since I noticed my skin felt dry after being patted down with the towel. I recently decided to add a retanoid cream and a chemical sunscreen into the mix but the timing of the sunscreen is throwing me for a loop. You see I work from home, and most days the only time I leave the apartment is to walk 15min to the local gym. It feels weird to put on sunscreen right before since I'm going to shower immediately afterwards and I assume that means it'll get washed off. But putting it on after the shower also feels weird since I won't be leaving the house again that day most likely. Because my work schedule has me working early mornings I tend to finish work mid afternoon then hit the gym. Which means I don't shower until around 4-5pm.\n\nIs the answer that I just have to get used to doing my skin care routine in the morning? That's a pain for me since I already have to get up super early for work.",

My doctor said 1.25 mg oral minoxidil would be enough, but I started with 2.5 mg. It’s been 5 days now, and I’ve also switched to an iron-rich diet.\n\nI’m honestly super stressed about my hair loss — I know it’s making things worse, but I can’t help it. My dad was around Norwood 3 at my age, though my grandfathers and uncles all still have hair. Only my dad and his brother went bald.\n\nAnyway, here’s my question: since I’m still young and not sure if I’ve fully matured hormonally, I decided to start with oral minoxidil first. My plan is to maintain for at least 1–2 years, then add finasteride later.\n\nBut I’ve seen some people on this forum say that after adding finasteride to their minoxidil routine, they lost all the gains they made and their hair actually got worse. Has anyone experienced this? If I start finasteride 1–2 years later, will my hair really get worse?\n\nI’m 19 and just want to wait a bit before jumping into finasteride.\nThanks a lot for reading 🙏\n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "Greetings you pretty curlies, this is my first post here, might be a bit long, please bear with me. \n\nIt's been a few years since I've graduated. My University was located in a damp, coastal region, so natural moisture wasn't a luxury there. That's also when I first found out I can grow wavy hair (bam!) and even curls after a certain length (double bam!).\n\nFast forward to now it's been one year since I moved back home (dry and dusty, arid desert climate) and I've witnessed much deterioration in my hair quality, feel and texture despite better, softer water supply. Which has also discouraged me to grow my hair beyond 6 months at a time. \n\nFor reference \nPics 1,2 &amp; 3: my hair from the time I was still studying for bachelor's, with minimal care (because a late teen living in hostel who barely knows about grooming, with lectures 6 days a week)\n\nPics 4&amp;5: my hair from the past month with a basic hair routine (rn I shampoo and use a leave-in conditioner on alternate days(due to excessive dust and heat around the city), sometimes use a normal conditioner-cum-heat repellent with the shampoo and occasionally use coconut or olive oil (once between 2-3 weeks))  \n\nBetween the years from then to now, I think I also let myself go and became somewhat indifferent to hair care, so that must've been another contributing factor to the damage.\nThis time thinking I'll grow them longer, went for a little trim yesterday, and I might be overthinking, but I think I got botched (will likely make a second post on that).\nAnyway, I'm finally turning to this community for advice to overcome the effect of an extreme change in climate and my own negligence. Thank you already if you've read so far!\n \nPS: I'd be grateful if someone can also tell me what my hair might be, I'm always stumped by that question for some reason. I've definitely got coarse, thick hair that become a dust catcher the moment I step out lol.",

I also recently moved to another country in Europe (from the US) so I have also switched conditioner / shampoo so it's the only thing I can think of that would be impacting it (my face / neck wash has stayed the same as it is available in Europe as well). \n\nI'm tired of worrying about which possible ingredients could be causing this so I want to go as absolute basic as I can - if I was smarter I'd create some kind of super- natural products with just jojoba oil, basic soap like Dr. Bronners, and water and some stabilizer but alas I am not that smart haha. Please tell me your over-the-top natural products with as few products as possible, ideally cruelty-free/vegan and available in Europe. \n\nI tried water-only years ago and it just didn't work with my curls or I would have said scr\\*w it and done that by now. \n\nHair routine for the record: I have mainly been using Garnier Fructis shampoo and conditioner (usually the ones for curls) and occasionally the Garnier Fructis Mask (Method for Curls) as it is cruelty free / vegan and was the first thing that made my hair not feel like straw (the area that I moved to has hard water which my hair did not like). I rotate between co-washing with the regular conditioner and then conditioning with it (sometimes adding in some of the mask if my hair felt too tangled or dry), and shampooing and then using the mask.\n\nThank you for any and all help!",
