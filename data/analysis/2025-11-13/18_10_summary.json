Also trying to optimize my routine and figure out the right combination of products and such.\n\nI cycle between three curl creams (Skala Blue and Yellow, and Elseve Curls) depending on what I last used as a conditioner, i.e. if I used the Lola hydrating hair mask I use Skala Yellow to balance it out since it offers nutrition. I wash 2 to 3 times a week, but I wet my hair every morning in the shower and style with curl cream + gel. When I'm done styling I shake my head and pat dry with a t-shirt, then I enjoy the following half hour of dripping wet hair and three more hours to air dry haha.\n\nIf you have any advice for my hair type and length, I greatly appreciate it!",

I've been trying to wait it out while my skin adjusts (had a lot of acne for about a month moving to UK several years ago) but it is just too painful. \n\nMy face looks like sandpaper - rough and bumpy all over, my wrinkles are more prominent, I have peeling painful red spots around my nose/ mouth/ eyes, lots of whiteheads and deep comedones.  I literally do not know what to do at this point. I can't use any makeup as it causes burning pain. The only thing that has relieved the pain is when I used a combo antibiotic/ hydrocortisone cream one night, but I know that can be very bad for your face so haven't repeated.\n\nThe \"non drying\" face washes and lotions like CeraVe always make me break out badly. I've tried the orange Neutrogena face wash (night only) as well as oil cleansing followed by hypoallergenic mild face wash (both anua brand) but things keep getting worse. \n\nI'm  still using haircare I brought with me from England (Pantene) so I don't think it's an allergic reaction to hair care. I am also still using all the same makeup (although haven't used any in over a week now).\n\nIn the UK, I used literally whatever face wash was cheapest (just no SA as my skin reacts badly), la roche posay cicaplast baume b5  plus caudalie serum, all at night. In the morning just store brand face sunscreen moisturizer.\n\nWhat can I use to help my face be less painful and get past the acne... I feel like maybe it's so dry it's causing more break outs?",

It became so textured and I would get like cystic acne on my cheeks and forehead, tbh my acne hasn’t been extremely bad but it’s still been quite bad at times.\n\nI’ve tried every skincare product under the sun (tretinoin, different acids, hydrating products, etc…) and have never found peace, I have tried simplifying my routine and it worked for a bit but then it just came back again. The only thing I haven’t properly committed to is a change in diet. I did try for like a couple of weeks but never noticed much difference. However, now I’m thinking that diet could play a crucial part in eliminating this?\n\nMy current routine is this:\n\nAM:\n\n- Aveeno oat cleanser \n- Uriage thermal water spray\n- Good Molecules hyaluronic acid essence\n- La Roche Posay anthelios spf 50\n\nPM:\n\n- Aveeno oat cleanser\n- Uriage thermal water spray\n- Good Molecules hyaluronic acid essence \n- Sebamed clear face gel\n\nActives:\n\nI use these in the PM and I use it every two days, I alternate between Geek and Gorgeous Calm Down and Isntree Chestnut BHA 2% Liquid.\n\nI just need help on what I should do and how to finally get rid of these clogged pores and reoccurring acne (the acne mostly appears on my cheeks).

It never leaves it shiny and end up waving back up as soon as I step out of the house. I feel like 3 years isn’t enough time for a straightener to give out like that. I clean the plates, I don’t use it when my hairs wet, electrical outlets are fine. I’ve even tried turning the heat up or down and nothing helps.

As I got older I reflected on my hair because it just got worse and worse and I knew I had to change my habits. So around 2 months ago I decided to wash my hair only 3 times a week with a sulfate-free shampoo and every other day just with water. After every wash I use a conditioner, leave in conditioner and argan oil. Then I blow dry my hair with a Skeleton brush to give it some volume. Once a week I use a hydrating mask after shampooing.\n\nFor months I used the Matcha Green Tea &amp; Apple Blossom Shampoo &amp; Conditioner from Not Your Mothers (Sulfate &amp; silicon free) but the frizz did not go away. Now I bought some products from Moroccan Oil (Hydrating Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, Leave in Conditioner and the oil treatment. The shampoo feels kinda weird after I wash it out, my hair feels quite stiff like I didn’t wash it at all. After I use the conditioner it feels better. \n\nSo is there anything I can change in my routine to get better hair? Are there any shampoo recommendations?",

I have always struggled with frizzy hair and undefined “curls” that didnt really look like curls. so i straighten my hair regularly at a pretty high temp (a little over 375°F). My hair is coarse, and thick- except at the roots. I took a hair type quiz and my results said 2c (also 1h, 5s).\n\nWith all that on the table, let’s get to the point. like i said in the title- i just had blonde highlights added into my naturally jet black hair. I am now trying to find the best drugstore/sally’s products. i am looking for the best heat protectant (preferably not a spray bc i always miss spots when applying), leave in serums or conditioners specific to combatting frizz and enhancing my natural hair type- so i can use less heat tools, masks or treatments to help any damage or breakage caused by the bleach/bring back shine, and anything to help with frizz specifically. I’m concerned bc in the past the products i’ve tried make my hair always look wet or greasy, so i’m praying i can find stuff that doesnt do that.\n\nI need “apply and go” type products bc i am so bad at committing to full routines with diffusing, and finger coils, and stuff like that.\n\nI know this was like a lot of- possibly unnecessary- info. also my “wants” at the end of the post might be unrealistic, so please have patience w/ a 23 y/o woman who never had anyone to teach her how to take care of her hair :(\n\nTLDR: concerns- frizzy, bleach &amp; heat damaged 2c hair, \n\nneed suggestions for- drugstore/sally’s beauty “apply and go” products; heat protectant, leave-ins, masks/treatments, etc…",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

But for about a year, it’s become a bit redder than the rest of my nose and skin and now it stands out. I’ve tried squeezing it because I thought it was a pimple, but without success.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nI’m a 22-year-old male and have never used any skincare products other than a moisturizing cream every now and then, mostly during summer. I also use shaving cream and aftershave balsam, though not directly on my nose — they might have come into contact with it occasionally.",
