      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Also trying to optimize my routine and figure out the right combination of products and such.\n\nI cycle between three curl creams (Skala Blue and Yellow, and Elseve Curls) depending on what I last used as a conditioner, i.e. if I used the Lola hydrating hair mask I use Skala Yellow to balance it out since it offers nutrition. I wash 2 to 3 times a week, but I wet my hair every morning in the shower and style with curl cream + gel. When I'm done styling I shake my head and pat dry with a t-shirt, then I enjoy the following half hour of dripping wet hair and three more hours to air dry haha.\n\nIf you have any advice for my hair type and length, I greatly appreciate it!",

With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry?

It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

I've been trying to wait it out while my skin adjusts (had a lot of acne for about a month moving to UK several years ago) but it is just too painful. \n\nMy face looks like sandpaper - rough and bumpy all over, my wrinkles are more prominent, I have peeling painful red spots around my nose/ mouth/ eyes, lots of whiteheads and deep comedones.  I literally do not know what to do at this point. I can't use any makeup as it causes burning pain. The only thing that has relieved the pain is when I used a combo antibiotic/ hydrocortisone cream one night, but I know that can be very bad for your face so haven't repeated.\n\nThe \"non drying\" face washes and lotions like CeraVe always make me break out badly. I've tried the orange Neutrogena face wash (night only) as well as oil cleansing followed by hypoallergenic mild face wash (both anua brand) but things keep getting worse. \n\nI'm  still using haircare I brought with me from England (Pantene) so I don't think it's an allergic reaction to hair care. I am also still using all the same makeup (although haven't used any in over a week now).\n\nIn the UK, I used literally whatever face wash was cheapest (just no SA as my skin reacts badly), la roche posay cicaplast baume b5  plus caudalie serum, all at night. In the morning just store brand face sunscreen moisturizer.\n\nWhat can I use to help my face be less painful and get past the acne... I feel like maybe it's so dry it's causing more break outs?",

I’m also very close to finishing up two new reviews I’ve been working on!          \n\n\n\nOver the past year, I’ve been testing a bunch of brightening and acne/blemish-targeting serums, oils, and creams, and I thought it was time to put everything together. Since there’s quite a lot to cover, I’ll be splitting it into two posts.         \n\n\n\nAs always, I test every product for at least 3 weeks (unless it causes irritation or breakouts, in that case, I stop immediately). I’m still in the process of finalizing the lists, so I’m looking to add maybe 1 or 2 more standout products in each category before posting.

As I got older I reflected on my hair because it just got worse and worse and I knew I had to change my habits. So around 2 months ago I decided to wash my hair only 3 times a week with a sulfate-free shampoo and every other day just with water. After every wash I use a conditioner, leave in conditioner and argan oil. Then I blow dry my hair with a Skeleton brush to give it some volume. Once a week I use a hydrating mask after shampooing.\n\nFor months I used the Matcha Green Tea &amp; Apple Blossom Shampoo &amp; Conditioner from Not Your Mothers (Sulfate &amp; silicon free) but the frizz did not go away. Now I bought some products from Moroccan Oil (Hydrating Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, Leave in Conditioner and the oil treatment. The shampoo feels kinda weird after I wash it out, my hair feels quite stiff like I didn’t wash it at all. After I use the conditioner it feels better. \n\nSo is there anything I can change in my routine to get better hair? Are there any shampoo recommendations?",

It was just unbelievable to me that i was actually receding. I never thought it would happen to me. It couldnt possibly happen to ME, right?? “Not at this young age”, i thought to myself. I’ve gone through many actual traumas, so i feel like shit trying to tell people that noticing my balding was traumatizing; but i really cant undermine how tragic it was for me and how hard it was to accept what was happening and that i needed to do something NOW. I just couldnt go bald man, i really couldnt. Fin’s temporary side effects scared me, but balding scared me much, MUCH more. I even had flared gyno from fin(prepubertal; i am NOT saying that fin caused it or was growing it) and just decided to combat it(I have been using dim and it had been working extremely well, after two months my testosterone seems to be normalized so i am tapering off with good results.) I’m not even going to lie, it was scary, but everythings going okay now that I seem to have adjusted. I’m getting benefits from fin beyond hair regrowth, but i’m going to avoid detail in fear of losing the main point and so that i don’t seem like i’m just praising fin endlessly.\n\nI’m happy, i don’t give a fuck.\n\nMy routine: Not a suggestion; just a reference as everyones body is different. \n1mg oral finasteride\n100mg DIM (Fat-based to increase absorption… started with 300mg for immediate relief)\nBeetroot powder for bludflew(i dont want to use minoxidil, im okay with lesser results)\nI keep my vitamins and omega 3s in check more than ever\n\nHormone profile: Before fin, this is my genetics\nTestosterone: Significantly higher than average\nDHT: Significantly higher than average; familial history of prostate enlargement\nEstrogen: Higher end of normal; had mild, unnoticeable pubertal gyno that resolved on its own\n\nImportant takeaways: Things i’ve learned\nAlcohol can SIGNIFICANTLY increase your short term estrogen, drink when your hormones have stabalized… personally i just quit for now\nWeed also definitely increases short term estrogen but it is much more manageable and i’ve been fine with it in moderation.\nEstrogen is necessary, obviously; personally, i got joint pain and more sick when i got infections after e2 became too low\n",

ISO help w/ product suggestions\n\nROUTINE: \nProducts- L’oreal “total repairs, damage reversing” shampoo and conditioner (1-2x a week), Hairitage “pass on the brass” purple shampoo (1x a month). \n\nPost shower- towel dry til it’s not dripping water anymore and then let it air dry. \nonce fully dried… i straighten it at around (375°F)\n- I don’t consistently use heat protectant or oil/leave in treatments as of rn :( but that’s what i’m hoping to change w/ this post…\n\nOk this is gonna be really long because idk anything about hair so i feel the need to give all the details so i can hopefully get the most accurate product suggestions…\n\nfor backstory and reference, I am a south asian woman, so my natural hair is jet black with no natural highlights or other natural color. I have always struggled with frizzy hair and undefined “curls” that didnt really look like curls. so i straighten my hair regularly at a pretty high temp (a little over 375°F). My hair is coarse, and thick- except at the roots. I took a hair type quiz and my results said 2c (also 1h, 5s).\n\nWith all that on the table, let’s get to the point. like i said in the title- i just had blonde highlights added into my naturally jet black hair. I am now trying to find the best drugstore/sally’s products. i am looking for the best heat protectant (preferably not a spray bc i always miss spots when applying), leave in serums or conditioners specific to combatting frizz and enhancing my natural hair type- so i can use less heat tools, masks or treatments to help any damage or breakage caused by the bleach/bring back shine, and anything to help with frizz specifically. I’m concerned bc in the past the products i’ve tried make my hair always look wet or greasy, so i’m praying i can find stuff that doesnt do that.\n\nI need “apply and go” type products bc i am so bad at committing to full routines with diffusing, and finger coils, and stuff like that.\n\nI know this was like a lot of- possibly unnecessary- info. also my “wants” at the end of the post might be unrealistic, so please have patience w/ a 23 y/o woman who never had anyone to teach her how to take care of her hair :(\n\nTLDR: concerns- frizzy, bleach &amp; heat damaged 2c hair, \n\nneed suggestions for- drugstore/sally’s beauty “apply and go” products; heat protectant, leave-ins, masks/treatments, etc…",
