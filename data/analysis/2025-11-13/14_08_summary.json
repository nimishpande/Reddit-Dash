It might seem over the top, but I really wanted to do anything that could help,  hoping something would end up working. \n\nOn Sept 26th, he started topical minoxidil 5% (AM + PM), oral finasteride 1 mg, nutrafol men supplements, nordic natural omega-3 supplements\n\nEvery Sunday I use rosemary scalp pre-wash to give him a scalp massage then double cleanse / hair mask with ketoconazole 2% shampoo. I also use a red light therapy mask on his scalp every Friday and Sunday.\n\t\nOn Oct 3rd I booked a prp session and it was extremely painful for him. I know this sub isn’t too fond of this treatment but he’s willing to try 2 more sessions every 6 weeks to see how it goes.\n\nAround Oct 11th (first pic), he started shedding a ton at the crown and hairline. On Oct 14th(second pic) the shedding got worse so he decided to buzz his hair. The shedding stopped around Oct 29, and since then everything has stabilized…I think. \n\nYesterday , Nov 11th, he took the new pic and I feel like there’s crazy progress already !!! I hope I’m not delusional but I feel like there is more density. \n\nI’m planning to start dermarolling his scalp every Sunday starting January since I heard that helps a lot. \n\nWill keep updating if people want to follow along. I love reading everyone’s success stories and I’m excited for future results ! \n\n",

After leaving it for around 15 minutes, I use my moisturizer: Tony moly mochi toner put in a mist spray, and then a gel ceramide loaded moisturizer (Finally Found You! local brand). Sometimes I skip moisturizer completely🫣 but my skin is working fine lol\n\nGoal: anti aging\n\nAge: early 20s (haha I know!)\n\nI also use Tretinoin 0.025% for body area (hands, chest, etc) —&gt; every day\n\n\nSunscreen: Erha Active Light Sunscreen (Local sunscreen with excellent protection, adherence and its waterproof) applied twice to make sure I don’t miss a spot and I don’t rub my sunscreen. I tap tap them onto my skin. But for my sun protection I don’t rely only my sunscreen. I use a UPF hat, UPF jacket, UPF gloves commuting to work. And I dress mostly conservatively (long sleeves and long pants)\n\nI work mostly indoor. I don’t reapply my sunscreen. \n\nWhy do I do this?\n\nAs each retinoid binds to different receptors/bind differently to the receptors, I want to maximize my result by using everything and it’s been working nicely!\n\nSkin condition: very clear, and my pores are very small (I have genetically small pores, but now the sebaceous filaments are mostly gone, makes them look even smaller), I don’t even remember the last time I have an acne. I got stopped by a random street interviewer/podcaster for my skin care and a lot of my friends compliment my skin quality. But I’m struggling with my skin looking “dull”. I have been using a vitamin C serum but I dont think it’s helping a lot? It doesn’t help that I’m facing health issues right now. So I still use light base makeup when going out.\n\nIirc I have been using Tretinoin for around 3-4 years. I built it up from 0.025 until now 0.1%. I added Adapalene for the last 1.5 year now. And the newest addition is Tazarotene (because it’s hard to get here) which I have been using for 2 months.\n\nSo far I’m not experiencing anything differently! I get flaky but it’s minimal, and I assume it’s the taz, because it’s been a while since I got flaky. I think my skin resiliency is very strong lol. I never broke out from a product. It’s either not working or working well for me.\n\nMy goal is to get my hands on Adapalene 0.3%. Sadly it’s not available here.\n\nLet me know if you guys have any questions!\n\n\n\n\n",

Did it improve definition, reduce frizz, or make your hair feel healthier overall? Any shampoos you absolutely loved or ones you’d never repurchase?\n\nAlso curious if your stylist recommended a specific brand or if you found your favorite through trial and error.\n\n**Routine:** SheaMoisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Shampoo, Jessicurl Aloeba Daily Conditioner, and Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Gel. I apply gel on soaking wet hair using the “praying hands” method + scrunching. I diffuse on low heat until \\~80% dry and let the rest air dry. I sleep in a satin bonnet and use a satin pillowcase.\n\n**Thanks** in advance for sharing your experience!",

      "content": "First 2 pics are from 2021, last one is my current hair. I’m just wondering if anyone might have some advice on what’s going on!\n\nBefore I started CGM in 2020, my hair was a frizzy, undefined, dry mess. I didn’t know I had textured hair at all; I thought it was just sad and damaged. I was using Dove Intensive Repair (I think?) up until I started experimenting with curly products and suddenly I had amazing ringlets and waves. \n\nIn 2020 I was using primarily Shea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine shampoo, conditioner, and curl enhancing smoothie. So lots of protein! I would also mix in some other haircare brands with gels, mousses, etc. and I would use a lot of cream. At that point my hair loved it and never got weighed down.\n\nFast forward to today, the slightest bit of protein ruins my hair, and my waves are continuously loosening. I stopped using anything with protein altogether. This last time I washed my hair I figured that I *must* need some protein, because things just aren’t making sense. I put in some AG Recoil after the shower (which has protein about halfway down the ingredient list), and my hair is so sad and sticky and limp. Otherwise, my hair still feels and looks much better when I use my regular moisturizing products (which are no longer strictly CGM). However, I’m still concerned about my texture.\n\nCould this be a hormone thing, or my hair just changing over time? Could it be length? \n\nAnother thing I’m curious about is the fact that I learned how to treat my hair wavy/curly (scrunching, less brushing, using products, diffusing, etc.) at the same time I stopped using sulphates and silicones. I almost wonder if those weren’t necessarily making my hair dry and pouffy, but just the fact that I didn’t know how to style it. Before learning anything to do with CGM, I used to vigorously rub my hair with the towel out of the shower (with zero product). I know, it’s so bad!\n\nSo in general, I’m confused about the changes in my hair and its behaviour. I would say it’s high porosity, and I have fine, medium, and coarse strands all over my head. Most of it is medium though. I’m thinking perhaps I need to let go of how my hair used to behave, and that maybe I need way less products now? It’s hard to change my mindset after years of heavy products doing amazing things on my hair, and now it’s getting flatter and flatter even when I use light products.\n\nRoutine\n\nShampoo: Garnier Honey Water shampoo (this is brand new for me and has sulphates which have been working better so far)\n\nConditioner: Garnier Honey Water conditioner (this is CG friendly, and I love it!)\n\nAfter shower: Garnier Honey Water cream and Innersense I Create Hold gel. Sometimes I’ll use Carina Organics Sweet Pea leave in and John Frieda Dream Curls gel.",

      "content": "Dry skin is a common concern that affects millions of people, especially during colder months or in low-humidity environments. If you struggle with tightness, flakiness, or dullness, you’re not alone. This guide covers everything you need to know about caring for dry skin, from expert routines to ingredient insights and product recommendations.\n\n# Why Dry Skin Happens\n\nDry skin occurs when the skin’s natural barrier is compromised, leading to moisture loss. Common causes include:\n\n* Harsh weather (cold, wind, low humidity)\n* Over-cleansing or using harsh products\n* Aging and hormonal changes\n* Dehydration and poor diet\n* Medical conditions like eczema or psoriasis\n\n# The Best Skincare Routine for Dry Skin\n\nA consistent routine is key to restoring hydration and strengthening your skin’s barrier. Here’s a step-by-step guide:\n\n# Morning Routine\n\n* **Gentle Cleanser:** Use a fragrance-free, hydrating cleanser to remove impurities without stripping moisture.\n* **Toner:** Opt for an alcohol-free toner with soothing ingredients like aloe vera or chamomile.\n* **Serum:** Apply a hyaluronic acid serum to attract and lock in moisture.\n* **Moisturizer:** Choose a rich, emollient moisturizer with ceramides, shea butter, or squalane.\n* **Sunscreen:** Finish with a broad-spectrum SPF 30+ to protect against UV damage.\n\n# Night Routine\n\n* **Double Cleanse:** Start with an oil-based cleanser, followed by a gentle foaming cleanser.\n* **Exfoliate (1-2 times a week):** Use a mild chemical exfoliant (like lactic acid) to remove dead skin cells.\n* **Treatment Serum:** Apply a nourishing serum with peptides or niacinamide.\n* **Night Cream:** Use a heavier cream or sleeping mask for overnight repair.\n\n# Key Ingredients for Dry Skin\n\n* **Hyaluronic Acid:** Attracts and retains moisture for plump, hydrated skin.\n* **Ceramides:** Restore the skin’s natural barrier and prevent moisture loss.\n* **Shea Butter:** Deeply nourishes and soothes dry, irritated skin.\n* **Squalane:** Mimics the skin’s natural oils for long-lasting hydration.\n* **Aloe Vera:** Calms inflammation and redness.\n* **Niacinamide:** Strengthens the skin barrier and improves texture.\n\n# Top Product Recommendations\n\n* Cerave\n* Nurabare Skincare\n* Minimalist\n\n# Expert Tips for Managing Dry Skin\n\n* Avoid hot showers and harsh soaps.\n* Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air.\n* Drink plenty of water and maintain a balanced diet.\n* Patch test new products before full application.\n* Consult a dermatologist for persistent dryness or irritation.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n**Q: What is the best moisturizer for dry skin?**  \nA: Look for products with ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and shea butter. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream and First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream are highly recommended.\n\n**Q: How often should I exfoliate dry skin?**  \nA: Limit exfoliation to 1-2 times a week with a gentle chemical exfoliant like lactic acid to avoid irritation.\n\n**Q: Can diet affect dry skin?**  \nA: Yes, staying hydrated and eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids (like salmon and walnuts) can improve skin hydration.\n\n**Q: Is sunscreen necessary for dry skin?**  \nA: Absolutely. Sunscreen protects your skin from UV damage, which can worsen dryness and lead to premature aging.\n\n**Q: What should I avoid if I have dry skin?**  \nA: Avoid hot water, harsh soaps, alcohol-based products, and over-exfoliating, as these can strip your skin’s natural oils.\n\n# Why Trust This Guide?\n\nThis article is written by skincare experts with years of experience in dermatology and beauty.

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "know this is gonna be controversial as hell but I thought maybe someone would find this useful because their skin is just like mine.\n\nNow to be clear. I am NOT anti-science or evidence-based skincare and hygiene; I'm actually all for it, and here I'm trying something dermatologists actually recommend. Also I am very serious about my hygiene even if what I'm gonna say will make it sound otherwise.\n\nMy skin has been acne-prone since my teenage years but it's not something serious or severe. Maybe 4-5 pimples develop simultaneously in different places on my face each month that usually go on their own. Once a year I may get a big painful cyst on the forhead. I also develop eczema around my mouth, and the skin on my eyebrows becomes flaky after every shower especially during winter.\n\nUnfortunately my body's skin is also prone to acne (and folliculitis?). It's also not something severe but it's very noticeable and annoying.\n\nThe most frustrating thing about all of this is how the pimple may be gone but its scar can last for MONTHS, which may make it seem like I have a breakout when I actually don't. It's always red marks so I think it's PIE not PIH.\n\nOf course seeing how skin is my first instinct was always to find the right products and right routine and be extra-concerned about my hygiene. Exfoliants (physical and chemical), cleansers, serums and moisturizers, and practicing sun protection. I tried everything a derm or a pharmacist would recommend to me. If anything, using these products would give me the worst and most severe breakouts that I would not experience normally.\n\nI was tired of it, it always made me insecure about my own body. I felt like I am always not doing enough and that I'm dirty even when I am literally just out of my everything shower.\n\nAnd early this year I've been seeing how dermatologists are telling people to follow much simpler skincare routines, where you wash every 2-3 days, use cleansing products only on the areas that harbour bacteria and smell the most (armpits, groin, feet, and hands) and let water rinse the rest of your body. I did it for my face too, only washing ears.\n\nI tried this for 2 months straight, but it was summer so I showered every day (now in winter it's every other day) and genuinely this was so good it eliminated eczema and “dandruff” on my face. No more big pimples on neither face or body, especially after shaving my upper lip which gave me the most stubborn pimples, and no more huge breakouts of folliculitis on my body. Maybe a few inflamed follicles here and there, but in general my skin literally just cleared up. Pimples stopped forming immediately but it took the PIE some time to clear up.\n\nOne issue with this though is that I have oily skin especially on my face, and I didn't want to get clogged pores, which my face struggled a bit with. So after a 2-month successful experience, and almost reaching the skin that I want, I went back to using cleansers on my entire skin and body, but this time I went gentle only using a cleanser and a very gentle washcloth on the body.\n\nAll of my progress was just gone like that in like a 2-week timeframe of using cleansers again. Nasty breakouts with huge pimples and inflamed follicles all over.\n\nNow I'm back to using soap on my AGFH only. My skin calmed down immediately and stopped developing big pimples (maybe small ones that disappear fast) or breakouts of inflamed follicle breakouts, but unfortunately the PIE that is all over my body and face is really frustrating. Hopefully soon I will buy something to treat it (If you have any recommendations please drop them! Preferably extremely gentle products).\n\nAnd no I never smell because I wash the smelly areas and use deodorant.",

Right now I am looking at two options , ASAKUKI 500ml or 300ml . Is that good enough for my apartment (750 sqft ) . Have any of you used the same model , if yes , how is it ? If you know any other good ones (under 3 k), please mention.\n\nWhen I looked into essential or fragrance oils , the most recommended was by the brand forest essentials, but that's too expensive . I don't mind paying upto rs 500 for a 10ml bottle.   \nI don't really care about health benefits , it's purely for the fragrance. I need suggestions for brands with good blends(eg : egyptian cotton , after rain , cut grass etc.) and individual notes (lavender , tea tree etc). A lot of people recommended Moksha lifestyle but I didn't see any reviews for their fragrance oils . If you have used it , is it any good . I don't like artificial / synthetic smelling oils .\n\nDoes fragrance oils  work in electric diffusers . Some brands have mentioned in their description that it can be used in diffusers and some haven't . So what's the deal there.\n\nI've tried lavender and lemongrass EO by aromahpure and didn't like it , was too synthetic smelling.",
