Switched to curly routine, spent 100's of dollars on products and tools, months of trial and error, still haven't figured it out. Takes hours every week plus dye every few weeks.\n\nFeet calluses for years. Bought so many versions of amope, callous remover products, creams, urea, you name it. Been at it for months. Out of sheer frustration, I now have bloody craters from overfiling and I'm limping around like an idiot. It's SO painful and didn't eradicate them.\n\nI don't do faux lashes or tans or anything \"extra\" - the only thing I did was get nail extensions for a couple of years. SO much money, and hours wasted at salons. Gave them up and nails have been absolute wreck for 6 months though l've been nurturing them with jojoba all day every day.\n\nConstant tweezing. Never ends and never looks clean. Waxed the eyebrows and peeled off half my lids. Did whitestrips and teeth are brutally sensitive.\n\nI don't even do skin care and luckily I am lasered. Hair removal was a whole other ordeal. Don't even get me started on weight loss/maintenance - that's a whole other post.\n\nI don't think I'm trying to do too much!

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

About a month ago, I started going to the gym regularly, and ever since then, I’ve noticed my hair shedding more and getting thinner.\n\nAt first, I didn’t have any hair routine because I thought it was just a phase, but my hair kept getting thinner and I started seeing more of my scalp. Around the third week, I decided to start caring for it properly.\n\nHere’s what I’ve been doing lately:\nHair type: 3A curls, medium density (used to be thicker), normal-to-dry scalp, and low to medium porosity.\nRoutine:\n- Wash twice a week with a sulfate-free shampoo.\n- After the gym, I usually co-wash instead of shampooing.\n- I apply a leave-in conditioner after washing or co-washing.\n- The next morning, I use about 2 drops of argan oil on my ends to add moisture.\n- I avoid heat, don’t even tie my hair, and I try to be gentle when detangling.\n\nHowever, every time I wash or detangle, I still lose around 10–40 strands, and my hair feels noticeably thinner — I can actually see some scalp in certain areas now. It’s been making me really anxious because it feels like it’s not stopping.\n\nI’m wondering if this could be caused by:\n- Sweat and buildup from working out\n- Stress from gym or lifestyle changes\n- Nutrient changes or dehydration\n- Or maybe something I’m doing wrong with my routine\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this shedding or thinning after starting to work out? How did you handle it, and what helped you get your curls and density back?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would mean a lot.",

By the 2nd day my hair feels gross near the roots bc so oily.  My hair is just at slightly past my shoulders. i keep a wide tooth comb in the shower and run it through my hair roots to ends after the conditioner is applied and let that sit while I wash my body and shave my legs then rinse out the conditioner.  And after shower i use seen ff leave in conditioner to help with dry ends and frizz, i usually apply root to ends and run the wide tooth comb through roots to ends then scrunch my hair to help curls,but thinking im doing it wrong also bc while i have curls its so frizzy then next morning top of my head and roots are  so oily so i have to wash daily.

The problem is it still doesn’t seem like my skin is getting very hydrated despite this layering.\n\nWhat do y’all use or recommend for deep hydration?

      "content": "Hello Curly Hair Community!\n\nI was today years old when I found out Reddit has a curly hair subreddit! I’m so excited to see lots of engagement and posts here and decided to share my hair story. \n\nApologies in advance as this post may get long…\n\nSo, rewind back to my childhood. I was born with and maintained 3a curls. Of course when I was a toddler and young child, my hair held that curl naturally. And with more age and time, I needed to start adding products to my routine.\n\nIn high school, I used products my mom bought me/we were able to afford. It was mainly Aussie or Herbal Essence mousses. They worked just fine and my hair was happy (and a bit frizzy) from what I can remember.\n\nFast forward a bit to when I was around 20/21 years of age. One day (using my usual mousse), I remember taking shower and doing my hair before work. Everything was fine, except my scalp just felt odd. Was it burning or itching? Maybe. But I was young and didn’t think much of it since it wasn’t that bad. Boy was I wrong. By the time I had done my hair and went to work (about an hour), my scalp was so red and had a crap ton of flakes appear out of nowhere. I was shocked and honesty traumatized.\n\nI instantly stopped using ANY products on my hair. I changed my entire routine. I went to a safe and basic shampoo (think hypoallergenic and gentle washes) and never followed up with styling products. In those times, I did start to use heat more from time to time (just so I would feel somewhat pretty on days I felt motivated to). \n\nThen at about 25 years old, I finally felt comfortable enough to explore SOME products again. There were some products that made my scalp unhappy and some that worked just fine… but nothing was helping my curls. \n\nBy this time already, I completely lost my beautiful curl pattern in my hair. Even now, I can’t get an even result unless I braid my hair (braiding my hair gives me that braid 2b/c wave). If I let it air dry WITH product, it falls to a 2a wave at best. If I let it air dry WITHOUT product, it’s varied everywhere. The pieces range from 2a to 2c. The only small glimpses of my old curl pattern I get to see are when a piece of my hair falls out of the shower and it’s a lone strand (not all the pieces are like this btw).\n\nSo here I am 4 or 5 years later in the situation. I don’t know where to even start seeing as there is SO MUCH information on curly hair. One day you hear xyz products are fine and the next they aren’t. So now I turn to you all who I hope can help me on my journey back to beautiful, shiny curls once again while making sure I don’t fry my skin.\n\nCurrent Products:\n\n- Kristin Ess or Redken Shampoo and Conditioner \n- Redken Leave in Conditioner \n- Moroccan Oil Leave in Hair Serum\n\nIf you’ve read this far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. My ears are open to any and all suggestions given my circumstances.\n\nThank You ♥️ ",

Pretty sure the red splotches are retinol burn but I’ve only used it ONE time. Does this mean my face can’t take it or what? The spots first showed up around the corners of my eye and on my eye lids but I def didn’t put the retinol there. Now it’s on my t zone, eyes, chin, and upper lip.\n\n2. If I can use retinol, how to I reintroduce it as I’ve only used it once so it’s not like I was over using it?\n\n3. I changed the vitamin C brand I use at the same time I introduced retinol, could that be what’s making my skin throw a temper tantrum?\n\n4. What’s a skin barrier? Did I change too much at once, mess with the barrier, then introduce retinol with a weak barrier?\n\n5. I’ve since read to only wash your face once. Should I stop washing it in the AM?\n\n6. I’ve also read the CeraVe cleanser could be what’s upsetting my skin? Is that true?\n\nGive me alllll your tidbits and opinions and help this naive little brain understand ✨skin care✨ \n\n—————\n\nPrevious routine for years:\n- AM: wash with hand soap 😂 (I know, I know..), IT Cosmetics eye cream, IT confidence in a cream moisturizer, and on rare days EltaMD UV Sport sunscreen. The AM days were hit or miss; I didn’t do it daily. \n- PM: wash face in shower with body wash (good stuff, but not for a face obvs), IT beauty sleep serum (vitamin C) IT eye cream, IT beauty sleep moisturizer \n\nMy skin:\n- The rest of my body has naturally very dry skin. I’ve never noticed my face being super dry; it def never gets naturally oily.\n- I do workout 5ish days/week and get pretty sweaty but usually shower an hour or so after.\n- I’ve never had bad acne or serious skin issues.",

But she wants to work on signs of aging, skin texture and tone, as well as maybe some acne/facial hair scarring.\n\nBesides a gentle cleanser and moisturizer, what else should I incorporate into her routine? She does laser her face 1-2 times a week so I didn’t want to suggest a retinoid before consulting the gurus. If she spaces it out right, could she use a retinoid? She’s 36 so it would be time for her to incorporate a retinoid into her routine if possible. Any other suggestions for serums or anything else we should try to incorporate either right away or eventually?\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

I haven’t been a big skincare person at all but have been starting to have a somewhat consistent routine since last year, and by that I mean I picked out a cleanser and moisturizer that has good reviews. I recently discovered I may have oily dehydrated skin and have no idea how to go about this. Below are pictures of my skin, and I have noticed that my skin has been increasingly oily especially my nose, it’s filled with blackheads and gets super oily even after washing it. I currently use La Roche Posay Toleraine Hydrating Cleanser and following it with the Toleraine Face Moisturizer both for AM/PM. I am willing to splurge on good products that would help! I also am eczema prone and have sensitive skin, specifically near the lip area and on my eyelids so any gentle stuff would help appreciated, though I will definitely patch test everything! My main concerns are my pores on my nose , as well as my chin area! And my eye bags are quite noticeable as well and I have been trying to work on getting my sleep but any product recommendations would be appreciated! ",

All my siblings have curly hair, and my parents. \n\nFor a few years now, I noticed when my hair is wet it forms spirals. When collapsed, it forms circles ~2 inch in diameter (I read something about circles meaning curls, S’s meaning waves, so that’s why I’m not sure which it is). \n\nI just did the float test and it seems I have low to medium porosity hair. I’m ngl, my hair is dry dry and has been boxed dyed many times, but not in recent months.\n\nMy current routine:\n\n-Aussie Wave shampoo and conditioner\n-Aussie Mouse/leave in conditioner (I ran out, haven’t gotten a new one yet)\n-Twist my hair in the direction it seems to want to go\n-Shake it upside down, then gently scrunch and air dry. I don’t have a diffuser but maybe I need one.\n\nThe problem is, even when I plop it for a long time, it dries a mess. My hair gets poofy, bent and all over the place. It takes a million years to dry so it’s never fully dry unless I have it down :(\n\nDoes anyone have a good starter routine (hopefully not too time consuming) I can get into? I want to bring out my most natural texture :) ",

I bought the tsubaki hair mask last week but now am not even sure it will give me results and do not want to spend more money\n\nWhen I do the float test, my hair stays at the top or parts of the strand sink ever so slightly. Even when I leave it for 15 min, take from diff parts of my head or break surface tension. \nWhen I do the mist test, its about 2:3 ratio what sinks in and what stays as beads.\nWhen I run my fingers along the strand towards the head, I feel bumpiness. These are all sort of conflicting and im very confused. \n\nAs for what my hair is like, I'm 87% sure it's wavy. I admit I do not take care of this waviness though (after having tried many times) and let it frizz up and then style it by wrapping it overnight. I know a symptom of high porosity hair is that it's dry and frizzy which mine definitely is. My ends tangle very often and the ends are feeling like they're thinning (I use argan oil on ends every day.) Overall my hair feels less dense and I'm going to be taking iron and vit D supplements for this. (I've been using rosemary oil once a week since April and while I do feel my hair is growing, I'm not sure whether this is due to the oil and also I do not know if the oil is making my hair thinner/fall out)\n\nIf oiliness is a factor, then recently along w/ hair fall my scalp has been getting oily quicker. (Like 24-36 hours after washing)\n\nAs for drying time, my hair does take at least 3.5 hours to dry. Often it's more like 5-6.\n\nDoes anybody have any thoughts on what it could be and what products could work? Also would love any advice about the thinning/tangly ends! I'm hoping iron pills will make a difference but I'm not sure :(\n\nETA: I just remembered to add never coloured my hair, never had any chemical treatments. I want to say on average I heat style it about 2-4 times a month but for the most part I go heatless.",

Also I exfoliate my skin once a week. It has been around 3 months but the changes are very slow and my skin is still very bumpy. Aha bha lotion does smoothes it for sometime but it returns back to its original state after some time. Please help me in improving my routine and share tips that helped you personally. I'm really insecure about it since 1 of my friends pointed this out in front of a group of people and everyone started to touch my arms and laughing🥲. Because of this I'm even insecure to wear short dresses and sleeveless tops as it is most visible on my lower legs and upper arms 🥲",
