      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I am thinking about being Raven from Teen Titans for Halloween and currently have “virgin” dirty blond hair.

I work from home so I am not concerned about it looking silly as it fades but I am worried it will stay forever as I have been told I have ‘very porous’ hair. I really don’t know a lot about this. Does anyone have any recommendations on products I should use or general advice? \n\nI attached pictures of the character and my current hair.

      "content": "I see a lot of people talk about hair porosity like it’s the same from root to tip but I don’t think many really understand how it actually works. (*Depending on hair type*) the hair near the scalp is usually lower porosity because it’s newer and healthier, while the mid lengths and ends naturally get more porous over time from everyday wear washing(esp frequent washes), brushing, sun, friction or just the ends being older. It is possible for hair from root to tip to be fully low porosity but for that to happen the hair would have to go through little to no damage in its lifetime of growing, for many people it’s inevitable that the porosity will change. \n\nWhen I only used lightweight, silicone-free products for my “low porosity” hair, my hair was a MESS, very damaged, and lots of breakage. My ends stayed dry and frizzy constantly, but once I started using heavier conditioners, masks, and leave ins especially with silicones, my hair completely changed for the better. Tbh once I stopped stressing about porosity and just focused on what my hair actually needed (oily scalp dry ends) is when my hair as a whole improved! \n\n*If anyone has also struggled with this too i can give some product recommendations in the comments on what’s worked for me!! lmk!*\n",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I recently moved for college to a very humid climate from a very dry climate where I was able to straighten my hair and keep it straight so I don’t really know what I’m doing lol. I also change shampoos often, but I’m currently using a Pantene one with no parabens or sulfates and I use a kerastase conditioner. I don’t have a set hair wash routine so I just wash my hair when I feel like it and sometimes use conditioner without shampoo. I use a not your mother’s curl mousse and gel and scrunch those into my hair. Before today I used to scrunch my hair before the gel was set but then that made my hair look wet even when it was dry( first picture). So this morning I showered and tried waiting until it was dry but it didn’t stay curly very well, I feel like my hair gets weighted down easily(last two pictures). In general I feel like my hair is curlier when it’s wet and dries less curly. My bangs and roots also don’t curl and the back section of my hair doesn’t either but I think that’s because it’s longer(I have layers). My hair also doesn’t stay curly throughout the day and rarely into the next day even when I wear a bonnet to sleep.  I used to use a diffuser but mine broke so now I just air dry it. Last thing lol is I’m pretty sure I have high porosity hair so it dries really quickly. Any advice on products or how to do my routine would be super helpful 🙏🙏, sorry this post is so long.",

She was confused why I wanted it short and I explained my curls don't puff up right if my hair is too long. She had me facing away from the mirror until she was nearly done. I couldn't tell anything was wrong due to my hair having been pulled straight from me letting it grown too long until I slept on it and tried to puff my hair up this morning. She cut it way past what I showed and now my hair is all over the place with one side being jagged and one side being nearly completely flat.\n\nI don't know if I just play the waiting game if it will fix itself my hair is wrong. She didn't layer it correctly, she didn't blend my bangs, and cut several inches past where I showed.\n\nI have a new product I was going to use and I don't even know if there's a point anymore you can't see the curls my hair looks like a bunch of cowlicks.\n\nI've never had my hair cut this badly.

      "content": "Hello Curly Hair Community!\n\nI was today years old when I found out Reddit has a curly hair subreddit! I’m so excited to see lots of engagement and posts here and decided to share my hair story. \n\nApologies in advance as this post may get long…\n\nSo, rewind back to my childhood. I was born with and maintained 3a curls. Of course when I was a toddler and young child, my hair held that curl naturally. And with more age and time, I needed to start adding products to my routine.\n\nIn high school, I used products my mom bought me/we were able to afford. It was mainly Aussie or Herbal Essence mousses. They worked just fine and my hair was happy (and a bit frizzy) from what I can remember.\n\nFast forward a bit to when I was around 20/21 years of age. One day (using my usual mousse), I remember taking shower and doing my hair before work. Everything was fine, except my scalp just felt odd. Was it burning or itching? Maybe. But I was young and didn’t think much of it since it wasn’t that bad. Boy was I wrong. By the time I had done my hair and went to work (about an hour), my scalp was so red and had a crap ton of flakes appear out of nowhere. I was shocked and honesty traumatized.\n\nI instantly stopped using ANY products on my hair. I changed my entire routine. I went to a safe and basic shampoo (think hypoallergenic and gentle washes) and never followed up with styling products. In those times, I did start to use heat more from time to time (just so I would feel somewhat pretty on days I felt motivated to). \n\nThen at about 25 years old, I finally felt comfortable enough to explore SOME products again. There were some products that made my scalp unhappy and some that worked just fine… but nothing was helping my curls. \n\nBy this time already, I completely lost my beautiful curl pattern in my hair. Even now, I can’t get an even result unless I braid my hair (braiding my hair gives me that braid 2b/c wave). If I let it air dry WITH product, it falls to a 2a wave at best. If I let it air dry WITHOUT product, it’s varied everywhere. The pieces range from 2a to 2c. The only small glimpses of my old curl pattern I get to see are when a piece of my hair falls out of the shower and it’s a lone strand (not all the pieces are like this btw).\n\nSo here I am 4 or 5 years later in the situation. I don’t know where to even start seeing as there is SO MUCH information on curly hair. One day you hear xyz products are fine and the next they aren’t. So now I turn to you all who I hope can help me on my journey back to beautiful, shiny curls once again while making sure I don’t fry my skin.\n\nCurrent Products:\n\n- Kristin Ess or Redken Shampoo and Conditioner \n- Redken Leave in Conditioner \n- Moroccan Oil Leave in Hair Serum\n\nIf you’ve read this far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. My ears are open to any and all suggestions given my circumstances.\n\nThank You ♥️ ",

I recently cut it into a shag and tried some CG methods for fun and I guess I have wavy hair. I just thought my hair was frizzy on top. My issue is that the longest layers at the bottom are totally straight, even when I was scrunching when wet it was hard to get any bend to the hair.\n\nwhat i think is my hair type:  \nmedium density, medium coarse hair strands, low medium porosity (more on the low side)\n\nwhat i've tried:  \nspiraleaf shampoo bar, kirkland moisturizing conditioner, garnier smooth air dry anti frizz cream , Fragfre Light Hold Hair Gel\n\nwashed and conditioned, rinsed completely, towel dry so i'm not dripping all over the floor, scrunch cream and then gel into hair to try to form curls, air dry\n\ni know everyone says to add product when it's dripping wet. i'll bring the products into the shower and try that next time. this was only my second time experimenting. \n\nmy hair is pretty heavy when it gets long, i was wondering if it was possible to have curls on the bottom layer or if i had to cut it. thanks.",

I can't pull it back into a ponytail. Sometimes I'm able to do a half pony, but then my shorter layers fall out and into my face. I've tried incorporating a headband but then it flattens the curls at the front. I've even tried just wrapping it all up into a headscarf but then by the time I'm done, I've sweated so much it looks like I just came out of the shower.\n\nAny accessories or styles that you've found worked for you?\n\nMy hair wash routine is 2-3 shampoos a week with conditioning about 1-2 times a week. I use a microfiber towel, curl cream and diffuser.\n\nThank you!",

I'm about to turn 40 and my skin, which was previously oily, is rapidly becoming very dry.\n\nI really like gentle products and don't mind several steps. I don't really have special concerns other than hyperpigmentation. I love to look glowy and hydrated.\n\nOne issue I'm having is that I go to the gym around 2-3 hours after waking up. In fact, that's probably why I started falling off my routine because it seemed pointless to pile on products and then sweat if off within hours.\n\nI have a Korean-beauty face wash I like and enjoy the Cos-RX snail mucin. I also have a retinol for night and an SPF for day.\n\nThank you so much!",
