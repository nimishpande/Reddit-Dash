Apply GENEROUS amounts of curling cream after every wash when still wet. Style by sectioning into small strands and detangle each separately by pulling between fingers until it runs smooth. Takes about 20 minutes. Air dry and never diffuse. Scrunch once dry.  \n\n\nMaintenance: Sleep with a bonnet. Loosely tie with a silk or fuzzy crunchy under the bonnet. Retie or style in the morning as needed with wetted hands. Trim ends every four months to keep curls healthy, hair doesn’t curl as nicely with damaged ends.  \n\n\nProducts: OGX argan oil of morocco shampoo and conditioner. Marc Anthony coconut and shea curling cream.  \n\n\nPictures taken at end of each day",

She told me she told her teacher and her teacher said, “Tell your mom to brush your hair.”\n\nI’m devastated we are the reason this happened . I worked last night (yay night shift) so my husband and mom got her ready for school. However, we all struggle with her hair. \n\nShe has long curly hair. When wet, it’s to her waist. Dry, probably mid back. We are okay with her having it long because she lets us brush and style it. We just suck at it.\n\nThe sections around her forehead are very short and frizzy regardless of what we try. \n\nRight now this is what we do. Bath twice a week using shea moisture shampoo and conditioner. When she gets out we put in leave in shea moisture leave in conditioner and brush out with a fine tooth comb due to knots. She’s a crazy sleeper. Let air dry. We try to keep in a basis at night when she sleeps.\n\nWhen I style her hair I usually just run my fingers through her hair or I’ll take a large brush and a spray bottle and completely wet her hair. My go-to hair styles are down, high pony, half up.\n\nMy husband and mom dry brush her hair (which I ask them not to do). Their go-to hair styles are singular braids.\n\nHere are pics.\n\nI just need advice. Products. Routine. Styling. My daughter is a girly girl who likes taking her time to look nice and we are failing her.\n\nThe front facing pic is from today when she got made fun of. The apple dress picture is air dried. The red dress is slept on hair no braid.\n\nI’m sorry for yapping so much. Thank you in advance for any advice. It is so, so, so appreciated.\n\nFrom,\n\nA mom with straight hair who has been crying all afternoon",

Used a little Cantu leave in conditioner when I was done, and then tried this brush out on my whole head for the first time. Air dried. \n(I'd love to see it's work when I put more effort into it, like by adding gel and curl cream or whatever and diffusing it) p.s. this is not a promotion, I just wanted to share a good find!!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

The mark is still visible and I feel like it's gonna be there forever, I'm thinking about just using a bleaching cream or skin lightener on it at this point, any suggestions?\n\n The only thing that makes my skin look better is face washes or miscellar water but that brightened look only lasts for like 20 minutes then the darker pigment comes back, I hate the sunscreen thing because it just sits on my skin n makes the mark look even worse!!\n\n I don't know what to do, I'm a recluse at this point, I have children and a gf but it's affecting my relationship because I don't want to go anywhere or socialise with her friends etc, shes one of those oh I can't even see anything people when it's very obvious which doesn't help, i need some advice, desperately.",

Like my hands and arms are black by the end of the day. \n\nThis being said, I find that when I shower, I still don't feel clean. I use washes for my face, along with peels every few days, but I still feel like I get a lot of blackheads and my nose pores always look a lil dirty.\n\nAlso, I get clogged pores under my pants as I use very heavy duty work pants, which get super hot, and a lot of dirt ends up falling down them (as I always have to squeeze through very tight spaces ) and this gives me a fair bit of acne and clogged pores around my hips and bum. \n\nSame thing for this, but I use a scrub for my body and i a loofa, but I still have massive problems like this. The scars they can leave aren't too pleasant either for that matter. \n\nSo yeah, anybody got any tips that come from relatable situations?

Also I exfoliate my skin once a week. It has been around 3 months but the changes are very slow and my skin is still very bumpy. Aha bha lotion does smoothes it for sometime but it returns back to its original state after some time. Please help me in improving my routine and share tips that helped you personally. I'm really insecure about it since 1 of my friends pointed this out in front of a group of people and everyone started to touch my arms and laughing🥲. Because of this I'm even insecure to wear short dresses and sleeveless tops as it is most visible on my lower legs and upper arms 🥲",

After giving it a chance and using it twice a week for a month my hair has natural curls... I am wondering which ingredient in here could have made the difference? I am still absolutely astonished this happened, any thoughts?\n\nRegarding my past month's \"routine\": I would wash my hair with a cheap no brand shampoo daily since I work out and have to wash it, and twice a week I'd apply the pink hair mask (pic attached) for 2-3min, then rinse it out, air dry, nothing else applied. I'd appreciate any guidance y'all may have : )\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0z6e61hid9uf1.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d06dc67f76b7e5fd79274363e0221ceebea4d80",
