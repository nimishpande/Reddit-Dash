She told me she told her teacher and her teacher said, “Tell your mom to brush your hair.”\n\nI’m devastated we are the reason this happened . I worked last night (yay night shift) so my husband and mom got her ready for school. However, we all struggle with her hair. \n\nShe has long curly hair. When wet, it’s to her waist. Dry, probably mid back. We are okay with her having it long because she lets us brush and style it. We just suck at it.\n\nThe sections around her forehead are very short and frizzy regardless of what we try. \n\nRight now this is what we do. Bath twice a week using shea moisture shampoo and conditioner. When she gets out we put in leave in shea moisture leave in conditioner and brush out with a fine tooth comb due to knots. She’s a crazy sleeper. Let air dry. We try to keep in a basis at night when she sleeps.\n\nWhen I style her hair I usually just run my fingers through her hair or I’ll take a large brush and a spray bottle and completely wet her hair. My go-to hair styles are down, high pony, half up.\n\nMy husband and mom dry brush her hair (which I ask them not to do). Their go-to hair styles are singular braids.\n\nHere are pics.\n\nI just need advice. Products. Routine. Styling. My daughter is a girly girl who likes taking her time to look nice and we are failing her.\n\nThe front facing pic is from today when she got made fun of. The apple dress picture is air dried. The red dress is slept on hair no braid.\n\nI’m sorry for yapping so much. Thank you in advance for any advice. It is so, so, so appreciated.\n\nFrom,\n\nA mom with straight hair who has been crying all afternoon",

Used a little Cantu leave in conditioner when I was done, and then tried this brush out on my whole head for the first time. Air dried. \n(I'd love to see it's work when I put more effort into it, like by adding gel and curl cream or whatever and diffusing it) p.s. this is not a promotion, I just wanted to share a good find!!",

Out of sheer frustration, I now have bloody craters from overfiling and I'm limping around like an idiot. It's SO painful and didn't eradicate them.\n\nI don't do faux lashes or tans or anything \"extra\" - the only thing I did was get nail extensions for a couple of years. SO much money, and hours wasted at salons. Gave them up and nails have been absolute wreck for 6 months though l've been nurturing them with jojoba all day every day.\n\nConstant tweezing. Never ends and never looks clean. Waxed the eyebrows and peeled off half my lids. Did whitestrips and teeth are brutally sensitive.\n\nI don't even do skin care and luckily I am lasered. Hair removal was a whole other ordeal. Don't even get me started on weight loss/maintenance - that's a whole other post.\n\nI don't think I'm trying to do too much!

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I have read that only to use conditioner on the ends and never near my roots, but i have always just applied conditioner the same way i do shampoo, am i doing it wrong? By the 2nd day my hair feels gross near the roots bc so oily.  My hair is just at slightly past my shoulders. i keep a wide tooth comb in the shower and run it through my hair roots to ends after the conditioner is applied and let that sit while I wash my body and shave my legs then rinse out the conditioner.  And after shower i use seen ff leave in conditioner to help with dry ends and frizz, i usually apply root to ends and run the wide tooth comb through roots to ends then scrunch my hair to help curls,but thinking im doing it wrong also bc while i have curls its so frizzy then next morning top of my head and roots are  so oily so i have to wash daily. Silly questions but help!!!!also i do clarify my hair once a week with vanicream shampoo ! \n\n",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m looking for some advice and maybe a bit of reassurance. About a month ago, I started going to the gym regularly, and ever since then, I’ve noticed my hair shedding more and getting thinner.\n\nAt first, I didn’t have any hair routine because I thought it was just a phase, but my hair kept getting thinner and I started seeing more of my scalp. Around the third week, I decided to start caring for it properly.\n\nHere’s what I’ve been doing lately:\nHair type: 3A curls, medium density (used to be thicker), normal-to-dry scalp, and low to medium porosity.\nRoutine:\n- Wash twice a week with a sulfate-free shampoo.\n- After the gym, I usually co-wash instead of shampooing.\n- I apply a leave-in conditioner after washing or co-washing.\n- The next morning, I use about 2 drops of argan oil on my ends to add moisture.\n- I avoid heat, don’t even tie my hair, and I try to be gentle when detangling.\n\nHowever, every time I wash or detangle, I still lose around 10–40 strands, and my hair feels noticeably thinner — I can actually see some scalp in certain areas now. It’s been making me really anxious because it feels like it’s not stopping.\n\nI’m wondering if this could be caused by:\n- Sweat and buildup from working out\n- Stress from gym or lifestyle changes\n- Nutrient changes or dehydration\n- Or maybe something I’m doing wrong with my routine\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this shedding or thinning after starting to work out? How did you handle it, and what helped you get your curls and density back?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would mean a lot.",

The mark is still visible and I feel like it's gonna be there forever, I'm thinking about just using a bleaching cream or skin lightener on it at this point, any suggestions?\n\n The only thing that makes my skin look better is face washes or miscellar water but that brightened look only lasts for like 20 minutes then the darker pigment comes back, I hate the sunscreen thing because it just sits on my skin n makes the mark look even worse!!\n\n I don't know what to do, I'm a recluse at this point, I have children and a gf but it's affecting my relationship because I don't want to go anywhere or socialise with her friends etc, shes one of those oh I can't even see anything people when it's very obvious which doesn't help, i need some advice, desperately.",

Pretty sure the red splotches are retinol burn but I’ve only used it ONE time. Does this mean my face can’t take it or what? The spots first showed up around the corners of my eye and on my eye lids but I def didn’t put the retinol there. Now it’s on my t zone, eyes, chin, and upper lip.\n\n2. If I can use retinol, how to I reintroduce it as I’ve only used it once so it’s not like I was over using it?\n\n3. I changed the vitamin C brand I use at the same time I introduced retinol, could that be what’s making my skin throw a temper tantrum?\n\n4. What’s a skin barrier? Did I change too much at once, mess with the barrier, then introduce retinol with a weak barrier?\n\n5. I’ve since read to only wash your face once. Should I stop washing it in the AM?\n\n6. I’ve also read the CeraVe cleanser could be what’s upsetting my skin? Is that true?\n\nGive me alllll your tidbits and opinions and help this naive little brain understand ✨skin care✨ \n\n—————\n\nPrevious routine for years:\n- AM: wash with hand soap 😂 (I know, I know..), IT Cosmetics eye cream, IT confidence in a cream moisturizer, and on rare days EltaMD UV Sport sunscreen. The AM days were hit or miss; I didn’t do it daily. \n- PM: wash face in shower with body wash (good stuff, but not for a face obvs), IT beauty sleep serum (vitamin C) IT eye cream, IT beauty sleep moisturizer \n\nMy skin:\n- The rest of my body has naturally very dry skin. I’ve never noticed my face being super dry; it def never gets naturally oily.\n- I do workout 5ish days/week and get pretty sweaty but usually shower an hour or so after.\n- I’ve never had bad acne or serious skin issues.",

      "content": "I am struggling so bad to understand my hair porosity and am worried I'm going to end up spending money on products that will give me overloads of certain things or not enough. I bought the tsubaki hair mask last week but now am not even sure it will give me results and do not want to spend more money\n\nWhen I do the float test, my hair stays at the top or parts of the strand sink ever so slightly. Even when I leave it for 15 min, take from diff parts of my head or break surface tension. \nWhen I do the mist test, its about 2:3 ratio what sinks in and what stays as beads.\nWhen I run my fingers along the strand towards the head, I feel bumpiness. These are all sort of conflicting and im very confused. \n\nAs for what my hair is like, I'm 87% sure it's wavy. I admit I do not take care of this waviness though (after having tried many times) and let it frizz up and then style it by wrapping it overnight. I know a symptom of high porosity hair is that it's dry and frizzy which mine definitely is. My ends tangle very often and the ends are feeling like they're thinning (I use argan oil on ends every day.) Overall my hair feels less dense and I'm going to be taking iron and vit D supplements for this. (I've been using rosemary oil once a week since April and while I do feel my hair is growing, I'm not sure whether this is due to the oil and also I do not know if the oil is making my hair thinner/fall out)\n\nIf oiliness is a factor, then recently along w/ hair fall my scalp has been getting oily quicker. (Like 24-36 hours after washing)\n\nAs for drying time, my hair does take at least 3 hours to completely dry. Often it's more like 4 or 5.\n\nDoes anybody have any thoughts on what it could be and what products could work? Also would love any advice about the thinning/tangly ends! I'm hoping iron pills will make a difference but I'm not sure :(",

I do know that my hair most probably still falls under Type 1 but I am slightly struggling to understand exactly what sub-category it falls under. My routine is simple but I wish to change it. For now, shampoo at scalp, conditioner, air dry (occasionally via heated hair brush) serum. I avoid wearing tight hairstyles. I usually throw my hair in a claw clip most days. I either sleep with my hair down or in a loose low ponytail/bun with a silk scrunchie.\n\nHair Characteristics: • Quite thick • Virgin hair • Gets greasy quite easily at the scalp but the lower quarter and ends are ALWAYS dry • Tends to always be poofy/gets frizzy super easily • The ends flick out or tend to sit in different directions (not uniform) • If I tie it in any way or sleep on it, the shape changes (dents, the way the hair falls) and it does not go back to the “default” shape until I wash my hair again.\n\nI have added photos for reference. I hope that they are clear enough. The texture has always been very similar but when my hair was longer, the frizz was a lot less obvious to me as I would usually throw my hair in a braid. I could really appreciate some help with identifying specifics and any advice on the routine. It is constantly poofy, ends are always dry and I have tried many serums/oils but to absolutely no avail.",
