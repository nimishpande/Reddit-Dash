Apply GENEROUS amounts of curling cream after every wash when still wet. Style by sectioning into small strands and detangle each separately by pulling between fingers until it runs smooth. Takes about 20 minutes. Air dry and never diffuse. Scrunch once dry.  \n\n\nMaintenance: Sleep with a bonnet. Loosely tie with a silk or fuzzy crunchy under the bonnet. Retie or style in the morning as needed with wetted hands. Trim ends every four months to keep curls healthy, hair doesn’t curl as nicely with damaged ends.  \n\n\nProducts: OGX argan oil of morocco shampoo and conditioner. Marc Anthony coconut and shea curling cream.  \n\n\nPictures taken at end of each day",

She told me she told her teacher and her teacher said, “Tell your mom to brush your hair.”\n\nI’m devastated we are the reason this happened . I worked last night (yay night shift) so my husband and mom got her ready for school. However, we all struggle with her hair. \n\nShe has long curly hair. When wet, it’s to her waist. Dry, probably mid back. We are okay with her having it long because she lets us brush and style it. We just suck at it.\n\nThe sections around her forehead are very short and frizzy regardless of what we try. \n\nRight now this is what we do. Bath twice a week using shea moisture shampoo and conditioner. When she gets out we put in leave in shea moisture leave in conditioner and brush out with a fine tooth comb due to knots. She’s a crazy sleeper. Let air dry. We try to keep in a basis at night when she sleeps.\n\nWhen I style her hair I usually just run my fingers through her hair or I’ll take a large brush and a spray bottle and completely wet her hair. My go-to hair styles are down, high pony, half up.\n\nMy husband and mom dry brush her hair (which I ask them not to do). Their go-to hair styles are singular braids.\n\nHere are pics.\n\nI just need advice. Products. Routine. Styling. My daughter is a girly girl who likes taking her time to look nice and we are failing her.\n\nThe front facing pic is from today when she got made fun of. The apple dress picture is air dried. The red dress is slept on hair no braid.\n\nI’m sorry for yapping so much. Thank you in advance for any advice. It is so, so, so appreciated.\n\nFrom,\n\nA mom with straight hair who has been crying all afternoon",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I have been having a big issue with frizz for quite a while and I was wondering if anyone would be able to tell me why/give me some tips on how to fix it. My curls are usually shiny and decently defined in the front and then the back is almost always not defined and frizzy. The back of my hair seems to be more coarse as well. My routine is as follows:\n\n1. Shampoo with Tresemme Shampoo (it’s not always the same type but lately I’ve been liking the Keratin Smooth one in the red bottle). I use a silicone scalp brush to make sure I get rid of as much residue as possible from my scalp\n\n2. Condition with Tresemme conditioner as well (usually either the Rich Moisture one or the Bouncy Curls one). I comb through the conditioner with a wide tooth comb and then i usually do a loose braid and let the conditioner sit for a couple minutes\n\n3. For styling, I usually like to use LUS brands step 3 All-in-One leave in but I am currently out of that so for a while now I have been using Cantù Coconut Curling Cream. I use a brush to saturate it all in my hair. I use a microfibre towel to scrunch out excess water and then I use praying hands to apply medium hold gel (most of the time it’s Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel but recently I have been trying the Olaplex number 10 gel). \n\n4. I scrunch my hair again with the microfibre towel and air dry until almost fully dry and then I diffuse until it’s completely dry. After it’s dry, I add the Argon Oil of Morocco penetrating oil, scrunching in and loosening the cast of the gel. \n\nEven after all this, I almost always end up with frizzy hair in the back. I even try to take smaller strands in the back and spray them with more water and make sure they’re totally saturated with product but nothing seems to help. I can never get even definition around my head. Any help is welcome 💔",

I have never used minoxidil, so do you think its time for me to introduce it to my routine?\n\n If you’re interested in my experience with finasteride, here’s the gist of it;\n\nI got on finasteride 0.25 mg (a 1 mg pill cut into quarters) on July 30th 2024, and I stayed on that dose for about 6 months before increasing it to 0.5 mg.\n\nI stayed on 0.5 mg (half a pill), and after experiencing no negative side effects, I upped my dose to 1 mg 5-6 months later. I’ve now been on 1 mg for about 3 months after microdosing for the past year.\n\nI have definitely seen insane progress even at 0.25 mg, and for a diffuse thinner like me, the hairline baby hairs were the most noticeable (even though I was hoping for my crown to fill in more/thicken up more).\n\n\nI have never used minoxidil, but I’ve been giving it a thought for a little while now. My dermatologist was never against it but I was just not in for the hassle of applying it daily and a pill was just easier and more convenient I guess.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

My skin tends to run dry but since moving it’s been very oily and I’ve had painful, cystic acne around my jaw and chin. The oil isn’t the thin oil I would get back home that just sits on top of dry skin, it’s a thicker, sticky oil that comes back within 30 minutes of me washing my face. I used the Burt’s Bees oil cleanser (I’ve used it for year and it’s worked great for me) and a Neutrogena hypoallergenic moisturizer. I’ve cut back on my moisturizer to try and curb the oil problem but it hasn’t done much if anything. My roommate recommended getting some tea tree oil to spot treat the acne but I haven’t had the opportunity to try some yet. Any advice on what to do here and what may be causing this change?

This is definitely the longest I’ve ever had it, and I’m keen to keep growing it out but needing some advice on maintenance, if I should go for a trim to help it grow out better or just stick it out longer then go for a cut.\n\nMy hair is thick, and pretty curly, and although it’s long now it tends to “fro” out. I shower daily because I work in healthcare but condition only and shampoo maybe once or twice a week.\n\nThen I apply a leave in condition and some sea salt spray and comb it back and either lock it in place with a hat or hair band while it dries. Somedays if I’m going out, once it dries I apply some hair wax to keep it formed up more but the volume of hair is hard to keep down lol. I hate the feel of gel and stuff that makes your hair hard so that’s why opt for wax.\n\nDo yall think if I keep growing it out length wise, eventually the length and weight will keep it down more and prevent the “fro”ing out ?\n\nAlso to mention, when I did it keep it shorter, it was always shorter on the sides and back with length up top. Which obviously is affecting the way it’s been growing out. Normally rock it wit a middle party, but thinking about just tryna pull it back like in last pic.\n\nThanks any advice appreciated.\n\nRoutine is Dr Squatch Conditioner\n\nShampoo : Dr squatch and sometimes head and shoulders only shampoo 1-2 a week\n\nOdele Leave in Conditioner\n\nSuavecito Sea Salt Spray when going out and sometimes Suavecito Matte Pomade",
