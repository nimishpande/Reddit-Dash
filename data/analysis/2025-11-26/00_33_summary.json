      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi guys!! Posting here because I’m really at a loss for what’s going on with my hair lately. To start, I want to add context to the pictures I added. First picture was taken a few weeks ago, second picture back in August, and third picture 3 years ago today. \nI’ve noticed recently that the following things hace been changing with my hair: \n- the area of my hair that used to have the tightest curls, my crown and my bangs, are noticeably looser and don’t hold as long, if at all. I have to finger coil my crown area to get anything. \n- my wash-and-go’s, which used to last over a month if i allowed it, hardly last two weeks without needing to be refreshed. \n- more breakage when i detangle \n- i have to fight my hair to hold volume when before i used to have to fight my hair to NOT be huge. \n- the products i used to love and adore are mediocre now. \n\nI also want to include that I RARELY straighten my hair (last time was over a year ago), and usually use low heat to diffuse, so heat damage can’t be the issue. I dont do tight hairstyles, hardly do ponytails ever. I sleep on a satin pillowcase, the same kind I’ve been using for years (even when the 3 year old pic was taken). I’ve been on hormonal birth control for over two years (and have not noticed any real change in anything that hormones might affect. My skin is still the same as always, and my cycle has always been regular anyways). I don’t frequently cut my hair, I actually used to cut it more back when the 3 year old pic was taken, so I’m ruling out curl shock as a factor too. \nI wash my hair every 1-2 weeks usually with a cleansing conditioner. I shampoo only 1/2 times a month and use a clarifying shampoo shampoo for one of those days. I use hair masks frequently, either for protein or hydration, for maybe 20 minutes after I shampoo (maybe protein overload? Over hydration?). The only thing I can think of that is messing with my hair is the brand I use…Shea moisture. Mind you, I’ve been using this brand for 7 years and it worked super well even after the CEO and formula changes. But not now. \n\nMy routine has always remained the same: shampoo twice (if I do shampoo), detangle with conditioner using a tangle teezer, use a mask of some sort, wash out with ice cold water. Use a leave in conditioner and section my hair to get maximum definition. Diffuse or air dry after scrunchie with a microfiber towel. \n\nI guess I’m asking if you guys have had similar experience with this brand, and if it makes sense for me to point these changes to me using products that are actually hurting my hair rather than helping it. I would also appreciate if you guys can recommend black owned hair products/brands that I can look into as well. \nThank you for reading my novel!! I appreciate everyone who took the time to read :) \n",

So I started looking at small microfiber salon cloths but in general though I wasn't sure if actually is something that would help. But if it is something that might help or is at least a luxury item to make things easier for her than would be awesome. But if does actually help is there any routines anyone on here has with hot towels that I can tell her how to use for skincare, assuming it helps? I know as a man myself that I hear hot towels are nice for beards so I thought it should help her right?

      "content": "Hey everyone! \nI’ve been dealing with a sudden acne flare-up over the last few months and ended up consulting a dermatologist. I was prescribed Isotretinoin, which I took for about a month, along with a topical routine including:\n- Aziderm 10% Gel (Azelaic Acid)\n- Acne-UV SPF 50 Gel (Sunscreen)\n- Nioclean AD Gel (Adapalene + Clindamycin + Alantoin)\n- Papix High Gel (Salicylic Acid)\n\nMy skin has improved significantly, and now it’s been a few months since finishing the treatment. At my last appointment, my dermatologist advised me to continue Nioclean AD Gel every alternate night long-term for maintenance, and otherwise follow a simple daily routine that suits my skin.\n\nI’m turning 25 soon, so I really want to build a balanced day + night skincare routine that:\n- Maintains the results I’ve achieved\n- Prevents future breakouts\n- Supports anti-aging, skin barrier health &amp; hydration\n- Is safe to use alongside adapalene (alternate nights)\n\nIf you have suggestions for:\n- AM &amp; PM routine structure\n- Product recommendations (gentle cleanser, good moisturizer, beginner-friendly actives, eye cream, etc.)\n- How to rotate exfoliants / retinoids safely\n- Best ingredients for anti-aging at 25\n\nI would really appreciate your help 💛\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "content": "It’s early days but I wanted to document my treatment journey to share my ongoing experience of taking oral finasteride (1mg daily) and oral minoxidil (2.5mg daily). For context, I’m 28M and it was this year that I first fully noticed my hair loss.\n\nThere is androgenic alopecia on my dad’s side but not on my mum’s, and both me and my brother have hair that’s “similar” to my mum’s family, which is why I had maybe falsely assumed I might be in the clear.\n\nStarting December 2024 and for a good part of 2025, I’ve gone through a period of high stress. Around the summer time is when I suddenly noticed that my hair was drastically thinner on the top. I have had some recession around my temples over the years but the big change this year was very noticeable diffuse thinning on the top of my head – all of which has felt quite sudden.\n\nWith so much noise and confusion online about hair loss and treatment, I was quite overwhelmed with info at the start. After doing my research I decided that I wanted to intervene immediately, so I started taking oral minoxidil and finasteride daily.\n\nI did experience a shedding phase when starting, which is when the first picture was taken – a couple of weeks into treatment. To me this indicates that the hair loss is genetic to a non-insignificant extent. I was also concerned that it may partly be due to stress, or even another condition that I was unaware of.\n\nBecause I couldn’t rule out other types of hair loss I’ve tried to cover my bases by also doing head massages and taking supplements – vitamin D, omega 3, zinc, probiotics. I have also bought a derma roller but I’m concerned that you could give yourself a scalp infection if not done correctly.\n\nFortunately, I’ve yet to have any side effects from the medication at all, so now it’s just a waiting game to see if the medication and diet changes etc. will work.\n\nIt’s now only about 3 months into treatment, so still very early on. I decided to keep track by taking pictures and I’ve been comparing the photo in September with the one I’ve taken today. Both were taken in natural light in the same room and it sort of looks like things are improving a bit (hopefully).\n\nThere is still a lot more visible scalp than what I was used to but it feels like it’s at least looking better than in September. From what I’ve heard, it will be a good while (1–2 years) until full final results are apparent but I’m hoping this three-month progress pic is a sign that things are going in the right direction.\n\nHappy to answer questions and if anyone thinks I’ve missed anything with my self-diagnosis and treatment plan then please tell me!",

      "title": "Need help fixing a botched DIY cut from almost 2 years ago.  How can I grow out these ‘Antenna’ sections? (Pics + Products included!)",
      "content": "I botched my hair back in 2024 because I was frustrated with my curl pattern (I now recognize I just wasn’t caring for my hair well - tbf I’m pretty sure I’m still not 😭). \n\nI now have these antenna curls that stick out and make my hair shape SO AWKWARD LOOKING. It’s taking forever to grow out, and I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to go get my hair cut because I’m afraid of it becoming really short to even everything out 😞 \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on what to do or how to style? I’m at a loss, I’m really upset about it. After wash day, I put a light amount of product in my hair and let it dry before clipping up my hair. Im thinning at the crown of my scalp so wearing my hair down isn’t really an option as it just gets more apparent until the next wash day. \n\n I have PCOS so hair growth is painfully difficult. I also have zero clue on how to care for my hair as I grew up the only mixed Black person in an Asian-White household/family. 😬\n\nContext on the pics: \n\nThis is taken the day after a bare minimum wash day, coming out of 3 weeks no wash at all (I’ve been extremely depressed for the last few months, I’m trying my best to care for myself despite the lack of motivation and overwhelm).\n\nHere was the routine for the pictures: just finished putting product in my hair and diffusing for about ~5min. \nThe products I used for the refresh were: \n1. Wetting my hair with water\n2. Nickel sized amount of the rice pudding leave in \n3. Innersense leave in spray \n4. Diffused\n5. 3-4 drops of Bounce curl hair oil \n\nThe routine I did for this wash day was first pre- detangle (I get A LOT of lint in my hair through the week, so I typically use the ends of sharp pair of tweezers to break up knots by gently poking through the knot with one of the tips and loosening the knot. I find that when I do this it makes detangling in the shower much easier and less likely to pull out more hair than necessary). I first used Nizoral since it was 3 weeks without a wash and I knew the flaking would be crazy, followed by a second wash with the Innersense hair bath shampoo, then I used the Innersense hair mask for 5-10min and finished detangling before washing it out. \n\nAfter the shower, I used the rice pudding leave in, a small amount of ouidad curl cream, then ouidad gel, then the Ouai anti frizz before diffusing. After my hair is dry and fluffed out, I use a few spritz of the Moroccan hair spray. \n\nMy routine when I am not in a funk:\n\nWash day once a week. \n\nWash day routine: \n\n1. Pre-detangle using the tweezers to loosen up knots that have a bunch of lint in it \n2. Wet hair and use the Olaplex No. 3 in a hot bonnet for about 15-20min. \n3. Rinse out the Olaplex\n4. Shampoo (Nizoral 1x/month, Innersense Hairbath shampoo every wash day) \n5. A second shampoo wash with less product \n6. Innersense Hair Mask for 10min and detangle \n7. Rinse\n8. Gently squeeze out excess water\n9. Rice pudding leave in conditioner \n10. Ouidad climate control style cream\n11. Ouidad climate control style gel \n12. Ouai Anti-Frizz \n13. Diffuse on high heat until dry\n14. Moroccan Hair Spray \n15. Diffuse on low heat for 1-2min. \n\n\nRefresh routine is basically the same as I described above. It varies slightly based on how my hair feels to the touch. ",

      "content": "I saw The Ordinary released a volufiline serum, which I wasn't expecting since there hasn't been a lot of research on it. After looking at people's experiences, some people say it did absolutely nothing, some think it helped, and some had bad results and wish they could go back.\n\nI was looking into it months ago, but decided against it because people report things like puffy undereyes, nasolabial folds getting worse, fat spots, and asymmetries since it's very targeted and hard to control placement. This is the thread that scared me: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15lha5r/is\\_volufiline\\_permanent\\_or\\_temporary\\_does\\_anyone/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15lha5r/is_volufiline_permanent_or_temporary_does_anyone/)\n\nWhat are your opinions on this? How could it be that it works TOO well for some people and does nothing for others?\n\nI am also wondering if because people are so careless with their application of it and don't do research, people are going to start coming out saying Volufiline messed up their face, lips, undereyes, etc. I mean, I literally saw videos of people misunderstanding it completely and applying it all over their face. I also saw a video straight from the Ordinary TikTok where she applies it over the \\*entire\\* nasolabial fold rather than the part of it that needs volume... wouldn't this add fat to the wrong place and make it worse? Anyway, I am holding off on it to see results for at least six months, but what are everyone's thoughts?",

Was going to order an A6 from Dr pen, as it seems like that product pops up a lot on this sub. But on the \"drpen dot co\" (Im not sure if links are allowed on this sub) website, there's a disclaimer that the cartridges are banned in the US, unless youre a licensed professional. I followed up with the customer service and they confirmed this. \n\n  \nSo how are people getting their derma pens / microneedling pens ? Do I just get a roller, or order a third party microneedling pen on amazon or alibaba?\n\n  \nReally appreciate the help :)",
