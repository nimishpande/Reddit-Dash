      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Help! Hi guys! This is going to be a long post but I need some help. So about a few years ago, whenever I got out of the shower and let my hair air dry, my hair would always get wavy and poofy and frizzy instead of staying straight. But I ignored that for years and kept treating my hair like it was straight, even straightening it regularly because I liked the sleek look.\n\nAbout two years ago, I discovered curly hair and wavy hair routines, so I tried some products and they worked really well. But the routine felt like too much of a hassle, so I went back to straightening.I also got keratin done in 2022. My hair was so damaged before thankfully I have recovered from that.\n\nRecently, I decided I want to wear my hair natural again, so I've been experimenting with different products. I also have high porosity hair now because I bleached it a few months ago, but I still don't feel like l've found the right routine.\n\nRight now, my curl routine is I use the Ouai Detox Shampoo and then the purple Pureology shampoo. I don't use a regular conditioner just deep conditioning masks. I rotate between the Fino mask, the Gisou mask, and the Amika Intense Bond Repair mask. After the shower, I dry my hair with a microfiber towel. For styling, curl creams weigh my hair down, so I stick to a lightweight leave in (the Pureology one works well for me).\n\nThen I use a mousse (either Umberto Giannini Curl Foam or Curlsmith Invincible Mousse) and a strong hold gel (Aveda Curl Enhancer Gel gives me a good cast). Sometimes I also use Curlsmith In-Shower Style Fixer. I either plop with a T-shirt or scrunch out excess water and diffuse on low speed/ medium heat. Hover and then cup diffuse.\n\nAt first, I get a great cast with really pretty waves and some spirals, but once I scrunch out the crunch, I end up with straight pieces and lose a lot of definition. The next day is even worse, even though I pineapple and sleep with a bonnet. It's honestly getting really demotivating.\n\nI also feel like I get all the volume at the bottom and my roots are flat I wanna get rid of the triangle. What type of haircut should I get to get rid of the triangle? Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong or what I should change? I get actual ringlets underneath my hair, so l'm not sure where I fall on the curl spectrum. And is curl training even a real thing? If so, how do you actually do it? Any advice would really help. Also all these pictures are recent except the last one its from 2023 when I first tried a curly routine! :)",

Plus it looks better with long hair in braids than short hair. \n\nI’ve been in and out of hospital recently and been on bed rest for almost a month. Which means my hair has been getting more matted than usual. I can’t shower at the moment due to my surgical site and fatigue. I’ve had my sister wash it for me this past weekend but it caused a lot of pain from the way I had to sit. I have my hair in Dutch/french braids all the time to keep it less matted and out of my face. It has still been getting super matted. \n\nI have thick long 2a to 3a. It doesn’t soak with water without having product through it first. My normal routine in general is shampoo, conditioner, olaplaex bonding oil, argan oil, leave in conditioner, curl definer. Then gets brushed and braid while wet. Sometimes had gel and hairspray to keep the braids intact for longer. \n\nWhen I can’t wash my hair, I use a detangler that’s a cheap kids (which doesn’t work as well as it should), water and sometimes more argan oil to loosen the knots. But lately nothing is helping and my hair breaks and the knots come out in clumps. It needs to not be too thick of a mixture and can be in my hair for 5 plus days after. I’ve been going about two weeks between washes at the moment. (Please don’t judge, plus my scalp is dealing with it a lot better than expected.) \n",

Over the course of the past two years looking online about hair care and hair types I think I’m somewhere between a 2C and 3A. The reason I’m not sure is because my hair gets tangled and matted so often that I can barely see its natural shape outside of the breakage and frizz. \n\nMy hair routine is really basic as it stands:\n\n•In the shower I use an off brand oily scalp shampoo to clean up any buildup I have. Occasionally I’ll use Rizos Curls Apple Cider Vinegar Scalp Rinse if I want to go for a DEEP cleanse \n\n•After two washes, I go in with Pattern Medium and try to coat most of my hair. After the first rinse with Pattern, I go in a second time and brush my hair while it’s still wet. \n\n•I air dry my hair. Once it’s sufficiently dry I tie it in a pineapple bun and put on a silk bonnet before going to bed. \n\nI thought a bonnet would help with having so much “webbing” my hair does when it gets tangled, but it’s always so intense and I don’t know what additional steps I should be adding to my routine. I just feel like every wash day is a battle to make my hair cooperate and last. \n\nHoping to get any advice from the wonderful people of this subreddit!\n",
