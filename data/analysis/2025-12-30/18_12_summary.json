      "content": "Has anyone else noticed that homeless men are almost always rocking dense hair with immaculate hairlines? I'm talking NW0, dense temples, zero diffuse thinning. There's clearly something we've been missing. Are they NW0 because they're homeless or are they homeless because they're NW0?\n\nSo here is the new hypothesis:   \nNo mirrors, no grooming routines, no showers, no job. only eating what you'd usually throw away\n\nThe theory is simple: hair follicles thrive when you completely abandon self-awareness and aesthetic concern. Stress, mirrors, and microneedling are the opponent. Let your scalp believe it’s safe, and your temples may just follow suit.\n\nAnother benefit is that since you grow out your hair, no one will think you're balding.\n\nI’ve always dressed business casual, shaved regularly, emphasized looking clean and put together. But for the past month or so, I had mental health struggles because of seasonal deprecion so I decided to let go. I stopped shaving, started wearing old looser street wear clothes, and stopped pretending. I look homeless. Still no regrowth, thickening or improved temples. Probably because I didn't fully commit. I still had a job, took showers and ate healthy. I didn't embrace homelessness. However, in a development I can’t scientifically explain, two alt girls hit on me during this period, which is statistically significant given my historical baseline of 0 alt girls hitting on me. Further study is needed.\n\nThis is purely theoretical but the evidence from observations is… compelling.\n\nThoughts? Has any one of you ever been homeless and if so, did you notice any regrowth?",

I partially diffused it on a cool setting then let it air dry. I then scrunched it again with a light hair oil to brake out the cast.\n\nAny advice on how to get those bigger clumps?

The truth is, the person I was two years ago would've sold a kidney just to know what clear skin felt like.\n\nWhile we all have our own victories, this one is mine. My skin may not be the clearest or the most poreless, but it is more than I ever dreamed of having.\n\nAnyway, here are some things that cleared my skin. Please do have your skin checked by a dermatologist. \n\n• Tretinoin (0.025%)\n• Hydroquinone (2%)\n• Clindamycin (1%)\n\nI did start on lower doses a couple months ago, but these are my doses now. I apply all of these every night and layer on a thick layer of moisturizer especially around my nose and on my chin. Hope this helps, and I'll answer any other questions too! ",

      "content": "So… I screwed up, and tried to remove an ingrown hair on my jawline a couple of days ago and this was the result.\n\nI’m 49y/o trans woman. I’ve done a dozen LHR appointments and a little over 50 hours of electrolysis, but I’ve had to take a break for financial reasons. Not shaving is just not an option (unless it’s to grow it out for an electrolysis session).\n\nI’ve tried so many different types of razors - single blade, three blade, five blade, electric, and many, many different types of shaving creams, lotions, oils, and after shave products, and nothing seems to help prevent them.\n\nCurrent routine is:\n\n•\t⁠Exfoliate in shower in the morning with CerVe Renewing SA cleanser - gently scrubbing with one of those little rubber exfoliating pads\n•\t⁠apply bump stopper shave gel and shave with the grain, using a Schick Hydro 5 blade. (I know, everyone says not to use multi blade razors, but it’s the closest shave I can get with the least amount of irritation. Also, I change the blade every 5 days and dry in between uses.)\n•\t⁠pat dry after shower and apply Tend Skin with a cotton pad.\n•\t⁠Apply moisturizer, and makeup\n\nCurrently not wearing makeup due to the abscess, and applying Neosporin to the area several times a day and keeping it uncovered.\n\nSo, I have two questions:\n\n1.\t⁠Now that I’ve learned my lesson about not plucking the ingrowns myself, what can I do to heal this current spot as quickly as possible?\n2.\t⁠Does anyone have any good recommendations or for products or methods to treat and prevent future ingrown hairs, other than “don’t shave”?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

      "content": "My skin still has a long way to go but I am so much happier than I was last month.\n\nSkin type: Combination, severe hyperpigmentation.\n\nI have wasted thousands of pounds trying to get my skin right.\nI was on tret for nearly a year under a dermatologist and it did absolutely nothing.\nElemis, Sachi, CeraVe, The Ordinary, No7, snail mucin, and honestly every brand under the sun. None of it helped.\nFacials and peels galore, and as you can see… two years later my skin was actually worse. Lots of the products also caused Pilling with my make up so they couldn't stay in my routine.\n\nI gave everything a solid amount of time, went slow, didn’t mix actives, followed the rules and still the closed comedones and hyperpigmentation were ruining my life.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just in my head. People constantly commented:\n“Oh dear, what happened to your skin?”\n“Gurl, that looks so bad.”\n“Have you tried xyz?” Yes love , I have tried it all!\n\nI’d go home, cry, and cancel plans because I looked rough.\n\nSlide 1:\nPicture 1 = last month when I woke up and cried at my skin\nPicture 2 = my skin today when I woke up\nSlide 2: My skin 2 years ago.\n\nTrial and error\nBefore, my night routine was either:\n• Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Moisture Deep Cleansing Oil (makeup days)\n• ELEMIS Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Wash\n• ELEMIS Facial Pads\nOR\n• Sachi Triphala Pigmentation Corrector\n• Ursolic Acid &amp; Retinal Overnight Reform\n• \nI didn’t use these on the same nights and tried both routines separately for a few months.\nThis still wasn’t working, so I stopped pretty much all skincare for a week to reset my skin.\n\nReset week\nAM:\n• Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n• Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner\n• Cetaphil Moisturising Cream\n• SPF\nPM:\n• Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Cleansing Oil (makeup days)\n• Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n• Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner\n• Cetaphil Rich Night Cream\n\nThis alone reduced some redness, acne, and texture. It didn't reduce the closed condomes but it didnt add to it.\n\n\nWeek 1 (the turning point)\nI introduced Acnecide Face Wash and within one day it helped with texture and closed comedones.\n\nAM:\n• Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n• Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner\n• Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Aqua-Fresh Rice + B5 SPF50+\nPM:\n• Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Cleansing Oil\n• Acnecide Face Wash 5% w/w Gel\n• Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner\n• Cetaphil Rich Night Cream\n\nThe next morning I had around a 20% reduction in closed comedones and texture, and my redness was basically gone.\n\nI ran out of the Cetaphil night cream and swapped it for La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+  which made a massive difference.\n\nWhen I switched back to the Cetaphil night cram the following week, the closed comedones started creeping back, so I stuck with Cicaplast.\n\nCurrent routine (week 2 onwards)\nAM:\n• Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n• Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner\n• Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Aqua-Fresh Rice + B5 SPF50+\nPM:\n• Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Cleansing Oil (makeup days)\n• Acnecide Face Wash 5% w/w Gel\n• Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner\n• La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+\n\nOther things that helped\n\n• Washing my face for at least a full minute. When I rush, my texture is noticeably worse the next day.\n• PMD Clean Mini cleansing device. I’ve used it on and off, but when I do use it consistently my skin is less red and feels more supple.\n• Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Toner. I use this when travelling (small bottle) and it works really well in the AM for extra hydration.\n• Dr. Dennis Gross Peel Pads.  I have used these on and off but due to other issues with my routine, the effect didn't last. Now when I used them once or twice a week they definently do what they are meant to do however if I used them more than this , then it brings back texture.\n",

Over the years I finally managed to put together a routine that seems to work for my skin, as in I no longer have bad break outs, rough texture or severe hyperpigmentation - I still have problems, like enlarged pores and scars from previous acne etc. None of it bothers me so much as my nose. It's constantly red (seems like hyperpigmentation at this point), veiny, itchy, flaky, and with tiny things that look like whiteheads when it's bad. Currently I only wash it with Bioderma Sebium Gel Moussant and moisturize it with Avene Cicalfate. Helps a little with the flaky texture, but it's still there. I can't wear makeup over it because it looks terrible, so I don't think the irritation comes from that. I don't think it's dermatitis because it's very specific to small spots around my nose, and I've had this for a long time now. Any help or product suggestion would be much appreciated.\nExcuse my poor english, it's not my first language.",

My hair is currently longer and well-defined, but the length makes it heavy and it tends to fall into my face, which I don’t like.\n\nI’m thinking of going shorter (around jaw-length) with a rounded, voluminous shape more of a curly halo / cloud silhouette rather than layers that hang down.\n\nWhat I’m aiming for:\n\n\t•\tNo bangs or fringe\n\n\t•\tMinimal hair on my forehead or eyes\n\n\t•\tAs much volume as possible all around (especially at the crown)\n\n\t•\tA bold, intentional shape rather than a shag or wolf cut\n\n\t•\tI’m okay with big hair I actually prefer volume\n\nFor context, I’ve had short curly hair in the past, but that was before I followed any curly routine (no conditioner, no styling products), so it fell forward a lot and looked messy. Now my curls are much more defined and controlled, so I’m wondering if the same length would behave very differently.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tDoes a short, rounded, high-volume cut work well for 2C-3A curls?\n\n\t•\tWhat length range keeps the shape full without hair falling into the face?\n\n\t•\tAny red flags or specific instructions I should give my stylist?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone with similar curl types or experience with shorter curly cuts.

Anyway, I have been trying some products and while my fronts stay wavy/curly, the back just hates me. It always falls flat no matter what I do. \n\nMy routine is:\n\n1. Shampoo with Balea Lovely Pistachio \n2. Shampoo once more (I have oily hair)\n3. (Every 2nd-3rd wash) Natura Siberica Frozen Berries conditioner\n4. Wellaflex mousse for styling curly and wavy hair\n5. (Sometimes) Langhaarmädchen Naturlockenspray.\n\nNever in my life have I protected my hair while sleeping, it's a little bit past my shoulders when wet and dries exactly at my shoulder length. Regarding refresh routines.... I have used a few sprays of the Naturlockenspray and that's it. Please don't hate me for my routine, I was never really taught how to take care of non-straight hair 😅 \n\nIs it normal that the back part of the hair is just living its own life or am I doing smth wrong? I airdry every time, cause I don't have a diffuser (it came with my hairdryer, but I had to move suddenly and that was before I found out that my hair is wavy). I also scrunch the hell out of it while it's damp, today however (picture 1) I tried it on soaking wet hair. Will update later with the results. ",

I could pop them if I tried, but it just makes a mess. I had an aquafirme facial done and the esthetician didn’t try to extract them. Should I avoid these?\n\nI was planning on doing .5 for most of my face, .25 on more delicate areas (like around mouth and my under eye(while staying on the orbital bone)) and .75 on scarred/wrinkled areas. what depths do you use personally?\n\nI ordered lidocaine but after research I’ve decided I’m going to skip it to get the best results. opinions on this?\n\ni see some people put on masks or apply serums immediately after the treatment. but everything I read says not to apply anything else? just your slip? I was thinking of applying Rejuran pdrn after but wasn’t sure?\n\nis it okay to wear sunscreen the next day?\n\nwhat is everyone’s favorite slip product?\n\nI’m 25 and have combination skin more on the dry side. my main concerns are acne scars and large pores.\n\nthank you so much for reading, I’ve been obsessing about this for months and can’t wait to start.

Turns out the real issue wasn't cleaner skin, it was destroying my skin's microbiome + barrier. \n\nThat tight after wash feeling isn't clean, it's damage. Your skin needs its good bacteria and barrier intact to actually behave. Once i stopped over-cleansing and dialing up actives, things changed. \n\nNow I only use:\n\n1. one gentle facewash  \n2. one simple serum  \n3. one moisturiser\n\nThat’s it, no 10-step routine. No constant product switching. My acne calmed, irritation dropped, and even my oily patches balance out.\n\nA few people I know have been asking exactly which facewash, serum, and moisturiser I’m using, and I’m happy to share…",
