      "content": "My darling beautiful 4 year old has started puberty early (medically diagnosed) This of course is accompanied by body odour. It’s kinda hard to manage, she obviously runs around like a four year old but unlike a teen it doesn’t even cross her mind to re apply after becoming hot and sweaty. We try to shower daily but those with four year olds know the battle. I desperately don’t want her to be the smelly kid in school. (She also has autism and Poland syndrome so already has things to mark her as different, and now this 😭) \n\nI need a deodorant that seriously works, like will last all day without needing to re apply. Works after running around outside in SoCal weather wearing a polyester Spider-Man costume. \n\nIt also needs to look fun. Again getting her to wear deodorant is a serious battle, I can tempt her if it’s something fun looking. (Also I kinda hate applying something to her that looks like it’s marketed to 30 year olds women) \n\nFinally it needs to be “cool”. If she does have it in her school bag and another kid spots it the brand is considered “cool”. I don’t care if I have to spend stupid money. Even if it’s tried and true but it’s like old lady deodorant it’s no good. \n\nI feel sad and stressed about this situation. Of course I don’t let any of this on to her. We all remember we the stinky kid at school. She is the most beautiful being in the world to me and she is kind and gentle and sweet. I just really want to prevent this one other thing marking her out as different. \n\nAny recommendations will be greatly appreciated. ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "I’m looking for impartial advice about my curly hair.\n\nI grew up never being taught how to care for curls (I was always told to brush it), so I kept my hair very short most of my life. A stylist recently told me I have strong natural curls and recommended growing it out for \\~6 months. I’m about 4 months in.\n\nI’m having a hard time telling whether what I’m seeing now is a normal curly grow-out phase that just needs shaping—or whether my curl pattern/head shape genuinely works better with short hair. I’ve gotten mixed feedback in real life, which makes it difficult for me to evaluate clearly.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n1. Is this current length/shape a normal curly grow-out phase that will pay off if I keep going?\n\n\\- Or does my curl pattern/head shape honestly suit short hair better?\n\n2. If the answer is “keep growing”, should I be doing maintenance shaping (sides, neckline, around the ears) to keep it looking intentional?\n\n3. If the answer is “cut it”, is there a shorter curly style that still works with my natural texture rather than against it?\n\nPhotos are anonymized. I’m genuinely open to either outcome—I’m just looking for curl-informed, impartial feedback.\n\n**Routine**:\n\nI shampoo and condition daily using Paul Mitchell Shampoo Two and Paul Mitchell Detangler conditioner.\n\nAfter showering, I do not towel dry. I let my hair air dry.\n\nWhile my hair is still damp, I apply a light Moroccan oil and DevaCurl cream using my hands. I apply both by scrunching the hair upward while my head is upright, letting the curls form naturally as they hang.\n\nI live in a humid area, so the products are mainly to control frizz.\n\nI do not currently use any protection while sleeping (no bonnet, scarf, or satin pillowcase), and I do not have a refresh routine on non-wash days.\n\nIf there’s anything else I should include for routine context, let me know.",

Over the past few weeks/months, I’ve developed a sudden cluster of very small, uniform white heads on my forehead (mostly between the brows and upper forehead, inner cheek (the cheeks next to the nose) They appeared pretty quickly and seem to spread in clusters rather than as individual pimples. They can be a tad itchy and tingly. It started 4 months ago with really small cluster itchy spots that have a lot of whiteheads but it disappeared so I didn’t think much. It comes back in those areas I mention continuously throughout the months but it wasn’t itchy anymore, but in the same areas the whiteheads seem to fill up over and over again. I thought I had a broken skin barrier so I stopped using actives and stuck to the purito oat in moisturizer. It helped for a little bit so I thought that was the case but then I woke up yesterday with more flare ups. Could this be fungal acne or something else?",

It’s really negatively impacting my self esteem. I don’t know how to fix any of these problems because they’re all new to me. I think I’m a bit allergic to the lotion I’ve been using but it wasn’t a real issue until I changed meds. I just want a whole routine reset. I hear that less is more when it comes to skincare, but what I’m doing isn’t working. (I’ve been using Cerave cleanser and lotion, but it makes my face itchy.) I was hoping for some advice and brand recs 💗\n\nI did also start micro blading but I don’t think that’s what’s causing the problem because the areas I microblade don’t seem to be the ones most effected.\n\nI’m especially upset about the red smile lines but it might be related to sleep deprivation.

My skincare routine was working at first, but my cheeks and chin have been breaking out a lot recently (mostly the past 2-3 weeks). It seems like there are lots of small white bumps on my chin that are under the surface, and just a lot of texture in general.\n\nMy current routine:\nAM: Rinse my face with cold water &amp; COSRX Vitamin E vitalizing sunscreen \n\nPM: Anua Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing oil, roundlab 1025 dokdo cleanser foam, roundlab 1025 dokdo toner, beauty of Joseon dynasty cream. Maybe once or twice a week I use Cosrx pure vitamin C serum. \n\nThe only thing Ive changed somewhat recently was the Cleansing oil, so that may be the issue? I'm not sure how to begin to remedy my skin or what to change about my routine so I dont break out so much.",

      "content": "To preface this, yes I go to the dermatologist, I get topical triamcinilone and clindamycin plus doxycycline. I’ve been diagnosed with keratosis pilarus and hydradentitis supperitiva. I tried all the urea and lactic acid lotions and never really felt they did anything. \n\nAdd in that I have dermatilomania, and it’s a vicious cycle. \n\nThe doxycycline is meant for the hs and has cleared it up besides a flare up occasionally, but I noticed it also made the kp less red and stuff. So it had me wondering if was just kp or something else too. \n\n\n\nSo one day, because I was bored and unattended, I put some veet sensitive skin hair removal cream on my arms where it’s kind of the worst. Weirdly enough my skin was the smoothest it’s been in literally a decade. I’ve had these weird bumps all over my body for years. Sometimes they get the tiniest bit of pus, but usually it’s a skin colored bump with a hair or a few curled up inside with a little pearl. Got them on my chest, arms, jaw, legs, literally everywhere. \n\n\n\nAnd this veet is the first thing I have EVER found to clear some of that up. Which means less picking so less scars. Some photos for reference of what I mean. Yea most of the scabs are from picking. I don’t even get skin irritation from the veet. \n\n\n\nThe first photo is from end of October, and the second is literally today. It’s night and day. Less redness, less bumps, and less hyperpigmentation. It’s amazing. I was just wondering if anyone else has kp and found that veet has a dramatic effect, or if people think it’s even kp at all.\n\n\n\nThank you so much! I hope for answers and theory and maybe this’ll help someone with similar issues. ",
