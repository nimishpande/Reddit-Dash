      "content": "My darling beautiful 4 year old has started puberty early (medically diagnosed) This of course is accompanied by body odour. It’s kinda hard to manage, she obviously runs around like a four year old but unlike a teen it doesn’t even cross her mind to re apply after becoming hot and sweaty. We try to shower daily but those with four year olds know the battle. I desperately don’t want her to be the smelly kid in school. (She also has autism and Poland syndrome so already has things to mark her as different, and now this 😭) \n\nI need a deodorant that seriously works, like will last all day without needing to re apply. Works after running around outside in SoCal weather wearing a polyester Spider-Man costume. \n\nIt also needs to look fun. Again getting her to wear deodorant is a serious battle, I can tempt her if it’s something fun looking. (Also I kinda hate applying something to her that looks like it’s marketed to 30 year olds women) \n\nFinally it needs to be “cool”. If she does have it in her school bag and another kid spots it the brand is considered “cool”. I don’t care if I have to spend stupid money. Even if it’s tried and true but it’s like old lady deodorant it’s no good. \n\nI feel sad and stressed about this situation. Of course I don’t let any of this on to her. We all remember we the stinky kid at school. She is the most beautiful being in the world to me and she is kind and gentle and sweet. I just really want to prevent this one other thing marking her out as different. \n\nAny recommendations will be greatly appreciated. ",

The clinician said I needed to “remove buildup” with 2–3 peels before moving on to microneedling. She told me my skin wasn’t hydrated enough prior to peels and still states this. \n\nI asked whether I could be allergic to the peel, but didn’t get a clear answer. Instead, she keeps saying my skin isn’t hydrated enough. I’ve followed all her hydration recommendations, but the issue continues. Some breakouts are deep and hurt as they come to the surface. \n\nAt this point, my skin is worse than before I started treatment.

Turns out the real issue wasn't cleaner skin, it was destroying my skin's microbiome + barrier. \n\nThat tight after wash feeling isn't clean, it's damage. Your skin needs its good bacteria and barrier intact to actually behave. Once i stopped over-cleansing and dialing up actives, things changed. \n\nNow I only use:\n\n1. one gentle facewash  \n2. one simple serum  \n3. one moisturiser\n\nThat’s it, no 10-step routine. No constant product switching. My acne calmed, irritation dropped, and even my oily patches balance out.\n\nA few people I know have been asking exactly which facewash, serum, and moisturiser I’m using, and I’m happy to share…",

A stylist recently told me I have strong natural curls and recommended growing it out for \\~6 months. I’m about 4 months in.\n\nI’m having a hard time telling whether what I’m seeing now is a normal curly grow-out phase that just needs shaping—or whether my curl pattern/head shape genuinely works better with short hair. I’ve gotten mixed feedback in real life, which makes it difficult for me to evaluate clearly.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n1. Is this current length/shape a normal curly grow-out phase that will pay off if I keep going?\n\n\\- Or does my curl pattern/head shape honestly suit short hair better?\n\n2. If the answer is “keep growing”, should I be doing maintenance shaping (sides, neckline, around the ears) to keep it looking intentional?\n\n3. If the answer is “cut it”, is there a shorter curly style that still works with my natural texture rather than against it?\n\nPhotos are anonymized. I’m genuinely open to either outcome—I’m just looking for curl-informed, impartial feedback.\n\n**Routine**:\n\nI shampoo and condition daily using Paul Mitchell Shampoo Two and Paul Mitchell Detangler conditioner.\n\nAfter showering, I do not towel dry. I let my hair air dry.\n\nWhile my hair is still damp, I apply a light Moroccan oil and DevaCurl cream using my hands. I apply both by scrunching the hair upward while my head is upright, letting the curls form naturally as they hang.\n\nI live in a humid area, so the products are mainly to control frizz.\n\nI do not currently use any protection while sleeping (no bonnet, scarf, or satin pillowcase), and I do not have a refresh routine on non-wash days.\n\nIf there’s anything else I should include for routine context, let me know.",

      "content": "Hey guys, just wanted to share my experience and what worked for me.\n\nSo I started getting this reddish dry patch under my eye, which would then spread to the area just above the eyelid. Over the course of 2-3 days, this would turn into flaky dry skin which was visible even with no makeup.\n\nI had never in my life experienced this before, but it started happening to me right after I met my new flatmate who had a lot of skin concerns and used to get this same eye dryness issue since her childhood. I researched a bit and it doesn't seem to be contagious, but I don't have any other explanation as to why I started getting this all of a sudden.\n\nShe told me her derma suggested her to use [La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume](https://www.boots.ie/la-roche-posay-cicaplast-baume-b5-soothing-repairing-balm-100ml-10149155?srsltid=AfmBOopoV9I2wUuQ1z44iYm1ua358hCHEMOxs-4bCdphy9Vq2ciJ7mfP), but this would take a whole week to fix the dryness around my eyes. This had become like a cycle where the red patch appeared and the whole thing was fixed after 1 week, and right after 2 days the red patch would appear again. One time it got so bad that it spread to around my lips and the doctor prescribed Calvepen 666mg tablets.\n\nHe suggested me to wipe my table, computer accessories and specs frame regularly. After reading multiple reddit threads, I started using [Blepharitis Eye Lid Foam](https://www.boots.ie/boots-pharmaceuticals-blepharitis-eye-lid-foam-100-ml-10205857) to clean my eyes every morning. Every time I could see the dryness starting even a bit, I would immediately apply [Eucerin Aquaphor](https://www.boots.ie/eucerin-aquaphor-soothing-skin-balm-40ml-10131555) multiple times throughout the day. This routine has thankfully stopped the cycle, and I haven't gotten it for 1.5 months now. I will update if anything changes.\n\nI deal with wrinkles under the eyes and dark circles around my eyes for which I am using [Eucerin Anti-Pigment Eye Care Cream](https://www.boots.ie/eucerin-anti-pigment-dark-circle-illuminating-eye-care-cream-15ml-10323699) in the morning, [Estée Lauder Gel Eye Cream](https://www.boots.ie/estÉe-lauder-advanced-night-repair-eye-supercharged-gel-creme-15ml-10316434) in the night and [Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum](https://www.boots.ie/beauty-of-joseon-revive-eye-serum-ginseng-and-retinal-30ml-10348093)on alternate nights. If you guys have any better routines that worked for you, please feel free to leave your suggestions!",
