      "content": "I’ve been taking 1 mg of finasteride per day orally for 5 months, and 4 drops of minoxidil per day with a glass of water (also orally).\nTwo months ago, I increased the minoxidil dose to 6 drops a day, since I hadn’t experienced any side effects up to that point. That’s still the case now.\n\nFor the past month, I’ve been losing around 100–200 hairs per day when washing or running my hands through my hair. Before this second shedding phase, it was a maximum of about 5 per day.\nSince the second shedding started, I’ve also noticed a change in my hair texture—some strands stay very straight while others are becoming kind of wavy. This happened to me during my teenage years too; I had almost forgotten about it. Also my hair becomes darker.\n\nCompared to two months ago, I personally don’t notice much new growth anymore (mainly because of the long shedding phase I think), but friends who see me every 2–3 weeks keep telling me each time that my hair looks denser and fuller than the last time they saw me.\n\nI’m excited to see how things continue and hope the regrowth will come back even stronger than before. But even now, I’m extremely happy and have already regained more than I ever dreamed of in only five months.\nThank you to everyone in this forum who “convinced” me to start the treatment. ❤️",

      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n\n\n**I'm a 25-year-old male from Rajasthan.** I struggle with oily skin (especially on my nose) and persistent acne, which has left both old scars (red and brown) and ongoing redness on my cheeks and forehead. I also have pimples on my shoulders, upper back, and sometimes in the hair at the back of my neck.\n\n\n\nI mostly stay indoors, though I sometimes go out for work or errands. Currently, I don’t use any face washes or creams because I want a routine that’s affordable, simple, and doesn’t take too much time.\n\n\n\n**Photos:**\n\n\\- I’ll be sharing pics of both cheeks and my forehead (not my full face). The images are taken in bright light, but in indoor lighting the scars, marks, and tanning look more noticeable.\n\n\n\n**My goals:**\n\n* Reduce or remove red areas, dark spots, and pigmentation  \n* Fade both old and newer acne scars  \n* Prevent new breakouts (face, shoulders, neck)\n* Keep my routine basic and on a low budget\n\n\n\n**Extra info:**\n\n* Skin is oily, especially forehead and nose  \n* New pimples appear less often now  \n* Not sensitive, but avoid products that burn  \n* Pimples also on shoulders, upper back, around neck/hairline\n\n\n\n**Product questions:**\n\n* I’m planning to buy the beminimalist Niacinamide 10% Face Serum (10ml to try first). Would it suit oily, acne-prone skin like mine? How should I use it, and how often?\n* If you notice pigmentation or uneven tone in the images, which cream or serum should I use for that (and for tanning/dullness)?\n* I don’t want to go for brands or creams with a shady background or too much marketing hype. Please suggest genuinely good options.\n\n\n\n**What I need:**\n\n* Daily routine, max 2-3 steps (just cleanser, serum, moisturizer or SPF is ideal)\n* Affordable, India available options  \n* Quick tips to reduce redness before events\n* How to tackle pigmentation and dark spots with budget products (if OTC works, or when to see a dermatologist)\n* Suggestions for pigmentation/tan and dark spots (please mention 2-3 product options in different price ranges so I can pick based on my budget)\n\n\n\n**Thanks a lot for reading!**\n\n\n\nAny honest, practical advice, routines, or product suggestions are appreciated. I hope I’ve covered all details. Ask if you need more context.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "**Male, 18 y/o. Fine curls (3A?). LOOKING FOR ADVICE ON FLAT, UNINSPIRING CURLS.** \n\nOn good days, my hair is able to form a great and volumous curl pattern. I use a product called Wavy Curl Creme most of the time, which seems to work pretty well the first week I use it after not using it for a while. However, after about a week it stops working as well - my hair becomes frizzy, undefined, flat and pretty uninspiring. The curls also don't seem to be forming that well either. \n\nI've also tried the Zielinski and Rozen curl cream which didn't give me the results I wanted, although I'm not sure whether I'm putting enough in. \n\nI've tried Curlsmith hydro style flexi jelly as well, which seems to make my hair more frizzy, but I can't tell for sure. \n\nI use Yves Rocher Curl shampoo and conditioner a couple times a week\n\nIt might be useful to know that my scalp has felt quite dry and flaky recently, so maybe these products have something to do with this?\n\nI use a diffuser on the medium heat setting every morning and scrunch the cast out after 15 minutes. \n\n  \n**My plea is this: what can I do to help my curls return to their perfect pattern and volumous state?** \n\n  \nI need a surefire routine (that isn't too time consuming or complicated) to perfect my curls in the morning. I'm SO tired of having these disappointing curls everyday! \n\n  \nI would be soo grateful if you could recommend some good styling tips / routine tips / alternative products / general advice.\n\n**Also**, some advice on whether these products i'm considering getting would be helpful for my hair is very much welcomed:\n\n\\- La biosthetique curl activating conditioning spray (I think there's a sulphate in the ingredients, though. Is this bad?)\n\n\\- La biosthetique curl defining styling fluid\n\n\\- Moroccanoil thickening lotion \n\n\\- Bounce curl define edge lift brush\n\n\\- Moroccanoil purifying scrub (for scalp issues)\n\n  \nAn important thing to also note is that I am wetting my hair every morning in the shower and applying the products in the same amount as the day before, as according to the Wavy founder, the creme washes out easily. \n\n  \n**Thank you SO much** ",

I don't know if it's a sensory issue or what, but I hate the water dripping down my face and arms and getting in my hair. I hate doing a whole routine in the bathroom at night, and mostly go straight to bed.\n\nIn my teens I just slept with the makeup (I know). Now I buy generic makeup removing wipes and use those while sitting in bed. I occasionally follow that up with a micellar water on a microfiber cloth or a Stridex pad and some moisturizer.\n\nSo, knowing that I'm probably never going to be over a sink to \\*rinse\\* anything, what's the BEST I can hope to do for my skin long-term? I know it won't be perfect, but are there some products that might be better than others? Thanks for the help :)",

I love shaggy/ messy looking cuts leaning into alternative styles, so I was wondering if y'all have any low maintenance hair cut suggestions like that 😓 though shorter hair suggestions are also welcome, i really just want to switch it up \n\nPart of why I've struggled to decide on something is bc my hair is really thick and grows very quickly (so i dont know which haircuts are compatible with hair like that), and I'm also not really sure on what would best suit my face shape",
