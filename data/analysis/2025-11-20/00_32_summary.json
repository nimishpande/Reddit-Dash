      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Is that the secret to maintaining shapely curls and beating the frizz with a bonnet? Is my bonnet not a good fit? What am I missing here?\n\nAttached are pictures of my hair at its best, and then the bonnet on my head, and how it looked when I woke up today, no product in it. Only conditioned.\n\n",

My current routine below:\n\n-Shampoo twice a week (I shower at nights)\n\n-Condition every day. I use a wide tooth comb in shower with conditioner in my hair\n\n-I pat hair dry some after shower then brush it while still damp/wet to get rid of tangles then leave to air dry\n\nIn the morning, my hair is a mess when I wake up so I put my head under the faucet as a “reset” for my hair to get it to lay down and style better. I don’t have a lot of time to let it  my hair air dry (don’t have a hair dryer. Wife doesn’t want me using one says it will damage my hair), so I pat dry as much as I can then towel dry it (I know I’m not supposed to do this as it causes some frizz but I think it helps my hair to lay better)\n\nIn the photos attached, I had used a drop of hair oil the day before and tried my best to pat dry only as best I could and that was the result in the picture (I think it’s messy and all over the place but I’m also not used to having my hair this length.)\n\nMy hair length currently goes to just above my eyes.\n\nAny help/tips/things to try would be appreciated.",

My only complaint is I wanted a really good haircut with some layers in the back to kinda give it some shape Because it was all one length at the time. I told her I did not want layers closer to the front of my face because every time I’ve gotten layers after getting them touched up it slowly just looked like I had two different lengths of hair.   \n\n\nMy hair before. My hair after. The hair cut it sending me to a spiral because it’s exactly what I didn’t want. But the roots are so dark they look black and I look like I’m wearing a wig. Is there anything I can do to fade this a shade or two that is quicker than shittt shampoo or clarifying shampoo? ",

So I am considering cutting it out from my routine. I was using it daily like the packaging said but it made me even more oily and I think that can contribute to the pimples. Sucks I found out after purchasing a very expensive huge bottle of it.\n\nI use L'Oreal Revitalift Vitamin C twice a week: https://www.loreal-paris.fr/soin/soin-par-ingredients/vitamine-c/revitalift-clinical-serum-12--vitamine-c-pure/OAP7229.html\n\nAfter shaving beard, once a week, I put Nivea Men Sensitive Pro hydrating cream: https://www.nivea.fr/actualites-nivea/sensitive-pro-ultra-apaisant\n\nThere are 2 products that I have and don't want to go to waste and was wondering if I should use them:\n\nPaula's Choice Youth extending daily hydrating fluid: https://www.paulaschoice.fr/en/youth-extending-hydrating-fluid-spf-50/m7800.html\n\nCerave Blemish control gel with AHA and BHA:https://www.cerave.fr/nos-produits/soins-cibles/soin-concentre-anti-imperfections\n\nI had bought them before landing the derm appointment thinking they would make a difference on what I already have. They didn't, but again, the point is to prevent new ones appearing an being kind to my face.\n\nSo what do you think about the products I have?\n\nAny recommendations?\n\nPlease and thank you!",
