      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Like, I grew up believing that if your skin didn't feel dry and stretched, the facewash wasn't working. \n\nTurns out... that's just my moisture barrier slowly crying in the corner. \n\nFor context: \n\nMy skin is normal-dry, but also dramatic for no reason, gets irritated around the nose, mouth, basically anytime I breathe wrong. I always assumed that was just me. So my whole routine was basically me trying to fix the dryness I caused during step one(cleansing).\n\nThen a few weeks back, I had this mini identity crisis likee...... why does washing my face feel like a battle? Why do I moisturize like my life depends on it the second I step out of the bathroom?\n\nI still like a lil bit of foam, so I started hunting for something gentle but not boring. Ended up trying the biome gentle gel facewash because it talks about microbiome balance and has hyaluronic acid, ceramides, glycerin aka the trio that usually keeps my skin chill. \n\nGuysss the difference is like OMG.......\n\nno tightness, no wierd itchy mustache area, no redness clown nose momebt, no sprinting to my mositurizer like it's an emergency. \n\nHonestly feels like my skin has been beefing with me for years and I finally stopped giving it reasons. \n\nIf anyone else switched to a gentle cleanser and suddenly understood life, plssssss sharee it here guyssss.

My skin is also quite oily, but I’ve noticed that when I hydrate properly, the oiliness decreases.\n\n**My current routine**\n\n**AM:**\n\n* Foam cleanser\n* COSRX Snail mucin\n* Avéne PhysioLif day cream\n\n**PM:**\n\n* Double cleansing\n* G9SKIN White in Milk Toner\n* COSRX Snail mucin\n* Avéne PhysioLif day cream\n\nI’m thinking about introducing **vitamin C** in the morning and **retinol** once a week at night to start addressing texture, pores, and early signs of aging… but I’m not sure what would be best for sensitive skin, or what would work well with the products I already have. I’ve realized that my skin **loves** the **G9SKIN toner**, so I’ll never give it up lol.\n\nDo you have any product recommendations or tips on how to safely build a routine without irritating my skin? This is my skin texture for reference.\n\nThank you! 💕\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qbdxmh3ene2g1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbca3ba088da582820e05408736f5a7378b9d4ff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t2dr9i3ene2g1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c0e16ac168f0d27ba8ee87693306bda40287d61\n\n  \n\n\n",

      "content": "Hey guys 👋🏻 \n\nLong time lurker here, I'm trying to incorporate oils into my skincare routine. Years ago my skin would drink it up with no problem and I was using the Pai Rosehip Oil over a ceramide serum which got discontinued. \n\nOver the last 3 years, my skin has became combination dry/dehydrated with eczema on the forehead. My barrier got wrecked from trying to incorporate too many new products like 2 years ago and from product reformulations (I also think I went through some hormonal changes too). Ever since, I've tried every barrier supporting product under the sun and have managed to find a simple routine that has been working since July (routine posted at bottom). Now that we're coming into winter I wanted to add an oil in to support my barrier.\n\nHowever, every time I try an oil (recently re-tried Pai Rosehip Oil) my forehead gets scaly, greasy, itchy and I break out in the same spot everytime. I've took other Redditors advice of adding oil as the last component but even with other layers of skincare underneath I still get the same itchy, scaly reaction. Does anyone know what this could be? Is it fungal acne? I'm at a loss here.\n\nRoutine:\n\nAM:\n\n- Splash with water\n- Organic Aloe Vera Gel\n- Geek &amp; Gorgeous Happier Barrier Cream\n- Organic Shea Butter\n- SPF\n\nPM:\n\n- Double Cleanse with QV Wash\n- Same as above just without SPF\n\nImportant note: I stopped using any actives since July to give my skin a break and to help my barrier. Also, I think I'm sensitive to fatty alcohols, citric acid and phenoxyethanol. I also seen a private dermatologist who was absolutely useless, they gave me Cetraben for my forehead but my skin hates paraffin so couldn't use it. I was using vaseline for a while but was still breaking out on my cheeks so swapped to Shea butter which has been working better.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",

      "content": "Hello, my brother (6M) has always had curly hair just like mine (kinda between 2C/3A), his hair was always incredibly soft and it grew at a normal pace for a boy his age. \n\nEarlier this year he got diagnosed with a rare cancer and he started chemo from late January until late September. We shaved his head before chemo and his hair only started growing back in October. \n\nThe issue is that after chemo, his hair grew incredibly quickly (which is not an issue) but now the hair on his head is extremely straight despite being long. It's silky smooth but incredibly straight, almost as if it's glued down with hair spray despite being quite long. I can't explain it any other way. Pre chemo, his hair was not as smooth but it was soft. \n\nRecently he started asking when his hair would be curly again because he misses it and he hates looking different to us. Every single person in my family has very curly hair except for him after chemo and it's starting to upset him. \n\nAlso: my brother did not have a hair routine before chemo. He usually washed his hair with whatever shampoo my mom used on him and we always let it air dry because we live in a hot country and it dried quickly. \n\nAnyway my question is, is this normal? Is this forever? Or is his hair going to grow curly again later on? Is this a temporary thing caused by chemo? Please help. Thanks. ",

      "content": "Hello everyone, \nrecently the weather in Germany started to get a lot colder and I wanted to start a real skincare routine for the first time (I used CeraVe Foaming Cleanser, which always felt too stripping and CeraVe hydrating lotion before). I took a few days to research. I have generally dry skin that’s sensitive with an oily nose with pores on the larger side. In the end I decided on these products:\n\n- Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser\n- TirTir Milk Skin Toner light\n- Anua 7+ Rice Hydrating Barrier Repair Serum\n- CeraVe hydrating lotion, because I never had issues with it\n\nI introduced the new products in a span of 3 days (I know that’s fast but I was just so excited they arrived). In the beginning, I felt great and my skin looked glowy and felt good. Gradually, after 8 days I noticed a few small bumps on the side of my nose, in the height of the under eye area. They’re too small to be pimples and honestly, I’ve never had them before. Research suggested closed comedones (even though I thought I only bought non-comedogenic products) and I decided to stop using all new products except for the cetaphil cleanser because the product list seems so simple and I still wanted to cleanse my face. It’s 4 days later now and the bumps haven’t gone away and even seem to have become more. I’m a little panicked right now. Have any of you had similar experiences with these products before, and what did you do? Could it be the cleanser? Should I stop it right now or give it some more time? Or could this be the after-effects of the other new products? Some help would be greatly appreciated. I would be really sad to not use any of the new products now or to have to buy a lot more just to get rid of this effect.",
