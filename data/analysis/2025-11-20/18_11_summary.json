      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I use a product called Wavy Curl Creme most of the time, which seems to work pretty well the first week I use it after not using it for a while. However, after about a week it stops working as well - my hair becomes frizzy, undefined, flat and pretty uninspiring. The curls also don't seem to be forming that well either. \n\nI've also tried the Zielinski and Rozen curl cream which didn't give me the results I wanted, although I'm not sure whether I'm putting enough in. \n\nI've tried Curlsmith hydro style flexi jelly as well, which seems to make my hair more frizzy, but I can't tell for sure. \n\nI use Yves Rocher Curl shampoo and conditioner a couple times a week\n\nIt might be useful to know that my scalp has felt quite dry and flaky recently, so maybe these products have something to do with this?\n\nI use a diffuser on the medium heat setting every morning and scrunch the cast out after 15 minutes. \n\n  \n**My plea is this: what can I do to help my curls return to their perfect pattern and volumous state?** \n\n  \nI need a surefire routine (that isn't too time consuming or complicated) to perfect my curls in the morning. I'm SO tired of having these disappointing curls everyday! \n\n  \nI would be soo grateful if you could recommend some good styling tips / routine tips / alternative products / general advice.\n\n**Also**, some advice on whether these products i'm considering getting would be helpful for my hair is very much welcomed:\n\n\\- La biosthetique curl activating conditioning spray (I think there's a sulphate in the ingredients, though. Is this bad?)\n\n\\- La biosthetique curl defining styling fluid\n\n\\- Moroccanoil thickening lotion \n\n\\- Bounce curl define edge lift brush\n\n\\- Moroccanoil purifying scrub (for scalp issues)\n\n  \nAn important thing to also note is that I am wetting my hair every morning in the shower and applying the products in the same amount as the day before, as according to the Wavy founder, the creme washes out easily. \n\n  \n**Thank you SO much** ",

My diet isn’t junk-heavy, I mostly eat homemade food and I walk regularly, so I don’t think lifestyle is the issue.\n\nThe texture on my forehead has been there for about two years, and I have pitted scars on my cheeks, but recently I’ve started getting random acne again. The texture, the jawline, everything just feels like it’s getting worse day by day. It’s really affecting my confidence.\n\nHere’s the routine I follow:\n\t•\tMorning: CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser or Paula’s Choice Salicylic Acid Cleanser, then Illiyoon Cream (the ceramide one), niacinamide serum after facewash, and sunscreen.\n\t•\tNight: Same routine, but I also use 0.05% tretinoin.\n\nI don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I don’t just want routine recommendations. I want to understand what I can do for my skin and my body overall to improve texture, pigmentation, and early sagging. I’m not even that old for my skin to look like this.\n\nAny advice would really help. Thank you.",

Initially, I thought it was just purging that's why I continued using it not until I developed some deep painful cycstic acne that made me stop using it. I also incorporated some spot treatments on the active pimples that time that i didn't know had salicylic acid on it and ended up making my skin worse.\n\nI instantly dropped all the products I was using and switched to a gentle cleanser, ceramide moisturiser, and sunscreen for a week. Right now, I'm trying to slowly introduce cosrx salicylic acid daily gentle cleanser by using it every other day (I've used the said cleanser everyday a year before and never had any problem with it, it also made my comedones on my foreheads before disappear). Also, I use a serum that focuses on fading dark spots/scars, which have worked on some of my scars and I use a 20% azelaic acid on both of the deep cystic pimple that left a brown-reddish bump on my skin (right cheek and left cheek).\n\nFor AM I Use: Cosrx Gentle Cleanser Soul Apothecary Radiance Boost Serum Ceramide Moisturiser Non comedogenic Sunscreen\n\nFor PM I use: Celeteque Gentle Cleanser 20% Azelaic acid (3x a week) Ceramide Moisturiser\n\nWill this routine help me address my skin concerns? This is my worse acne breakout yet and it's been messing with my confidence :((. I've always kept my skincare routine simple, but now I just don't know what product to use anymore and i think experimenting with different products just irritates my skin even more.\n\nPlease do suggest some ingredients or products I can incorporate if the products I'm currently using is not advisable or appropriate for my concern! Thank you!",

      "content": "I went to a new stylist yesterday to get blonde highlights in my all natural hair. The salon had good reviews and this particular stylist is a senior stylist so I thought it would be an easy experience.\n\nI have had blonde highlights in my hair throughout my adult life but grew out my natural hair during the pandemic. My natural colour is a light ashy brown. I’ve never had any past issues with process of dying my hair blonde.\n\nSo yesterday, I asked for partial highlights. I told the stylist I wanted it to look natural but a bit brighter and wanted regrowth to blend as much as possible. I showed her pictures for reference. So she does the foils, more than expected but I figured she knew what she was doing. When she took the foils out, she asked me what I thought. I said it looked a bit orange/brassy, especially at the top. She said that is normal and she still had to do toner. So she proceeds to paint toner all over my head. Now the finished product looks like an entire dye job that is brassy/orange looking. I don’t see my natural hair at all and the tone doesn’t match my skin.\n\nI’m very sad because I spent a lot of time and money yesterday. I was treating myself after having a baby last year. I felt very unattractive postpartum and thought this would give me a boost but now I feel worse. I know it’s just hair but it’s made me sad.\n\nAnyway, I’m going to try to find a stylist who can fix it but in the meantime, is there anything I can do (e.g. purple shampoo)? Also wondering why she would have done a two-step process and painted my whole head with toner? I’ve never had it done that way before.\n\nI’ve included a picture of what it looks like. That’s not me but this is the same tone I’m dealing with.",
