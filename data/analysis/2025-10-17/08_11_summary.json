I know people might think it’s fair because it takes “extra knowledge” but here’s my thing: we naturally grow curly hair out of our heads. 60% of the world’s population does. It makes absolutely no sense to center hair care only around straight hair as the norm, with curly hair as the exception. Beauty schools should mandatorily teach their students how to style curly hair, and to not do so is discrimination. Plus, styling curly hair is not even hard!! It doesn’t take MORE knowledge, it only takes a DIFFERENT set of knowledge than straight hair. I would go as far as to call it racist, given that most people with curly hair are people of color (even though I am not). It’s not our fault our hair grows like this and we should not be made to pay more because of it. Shame on any salon that practices this. \n\n(Since I have to include my hair routine: I wash with Lola’s shampoo and conditioner, and style with Arvensis defining cream and salon line’s gel)",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I use the minoxidil once a day along my hairline and take 1 mg Finasteride along with zinc and vitamin D every day.\n\nI am very happy with the progress so far and from what I’ve read I could potentially see even more progress since it takes a full year of consistent use of the medications to see the full results. I have not had any side effects from either medication. The only difference I’ve noticed in my life is my hair has gotten better. I had a lot of shedding the 2nd month of taking finasteride, my hands were covered in hair every time I showered. After that stopped is when I really noticed my hair getting thicker, especially along my hairline.",

They tend to go in any direction and make weird ringlets sometimes or loose curls\n\nI use OGX rosemary mint shampoo every 3 days, and conditioning with a biotin &amp; collagen, sometimes a argan oil conditioner.\nI use afterwards a curl cream with coconut oil, a hair mousse, and gel afterwards during the day if I’m going out then a argan oil to help soften it after scrunching. I air dry my hair but looking to get a diffuser \n\nLet me know if there are any better products available as I was using an expensive one in the past but switched up for affordability as going through products fast even with less use \n\nInfo: hair is still wet in the photos, once dry it looks very similar with loose curls and more full on the bottom then top",
