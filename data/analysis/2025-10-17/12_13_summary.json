I know people might think it‚Äôs fair because it takes ‚Äúextra knowledge‚Äù but here‚Äôs my thing: we naturally grow curly hair out of our heads. 60% of the world‚Äôs population does. It makes absolutely no sense to center hair care only around straight hair as the norm, with curly hair as the exception. Beauty schools should mandatorily teach their students how to style curly hair, and to not do so is discrimination. Plus, styling curly hair is not even hard!! It doesn‚Äôt take MORE knowledge, it only takes a DIFFERENT set of knowledge than straight hair. I would go as far as to call it racist, given that most people with curly hair are people of color (even though I am not). It‚Äôs not our fault our hair grows like this and we should not be made to pay more because of it. Shame on any salon that practices this. \n\n(Since I have to include my hair routine: I wash with Lola‚Äôs shampoo and conditioner, and style with Arvensis defining cream and salon line‚Äôs gel)",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe‚Ñ¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "1 - Stick to a routine. Doing CTM daily will give you better results than buying a 3,000 rs serum you use once a week.\n\n2 - If a product suits you, don‚Äôt switch just because some influencer said so. I‚Äôve stuck to Clinique moisturiser for 5+ years and it still works.\n\n3 - What you eat shows up on your face. Avoid sugars and oils as much as you can.\n\n4 - CTM (Cleanse, tone, moisturise) is the best advice for most people. You don‚Äôt need 10 steps unless you're a professional whose career or work depends on having perfect skin. \n\n5 - Don‚Äôt fall for hype. everyone went crazy about that Dot &amp; Key Vitamin C serum and then forgot about it in 2 months? So stick to what has been working for others for years and not stuff that is trending.\n\n6 - Use sunscreen daily. SPF 30+ at least. The minimalist or Re‚Äôequil sunscreens are best.\n\n7 - Scrubs are not essential. and you should definitely not use them twice a week. Once every 8‚Äì10 days is enough unless you have blackhead-prone skin.\n\n8 - Buy for your skin type, depending on whether it is oily, dry, or a combo. Just because someone on Reddit said snail mucin is great doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll suit you.\n\n9 - Go for small sizes. Most people don‚Äôt even finish their products before they expire or oxidise which will do more harm than good (those damn vitamin C serums).\n\n10 - IMPORTANT: Don‚Äôt store skincare in the same bathroom as your regular shower. heat + steam is really bad for the shelf life of those products, if you must, keep them in a locked cabinet.\n\n11 - Mild cleanser &gt; harsh actives, unless you‚Äôre using something prescribed like AHA/BHA. Cetaphil and Simple are safe bets.\n\n12 - Drinking water is good, but it won‚Äôt clear your acne. That happens only with skincare + diet + hormones.\n\n13 - Don‚Äôt layer 6 products, the actives can clash. Stick to 3‚Äì4 max. Example: cleanser, serum, moisturiser, sunscreen.\n\n14 - New products take 3‚Äì6 weeks to show results.\n\n15 - Never sleep with makeup, not even tinted sunscreen. Just double clense and go to bed.\n\n16 - KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF YOUR FACE. Girl, you have no idea how dirt your phone is.\n\n17 - Sleep matters. Netflix binges will def show up on your skin.\n\n18 - DIY masks with lemon, toothpaste, or haldi ARE A BIG NO. Ayurvedic stuff is good but only in moderation, most natural chemicals are really bad for your skin because of how little you've been exposed to them.\n\n19 - Don‚Äôt blindly follow someone else‚Äôs routine. Make your own after experimentation and consultation from dermats.\n\n20 - Good skin isn‚Äôt flawless. it‚Äôs healthy, hydrated, and consistent. Stop chasing ‚Äúglass skin‚Äù filters. That's marketing and especially for Indians, VERY HARD to achieve. Koreans can get that effect because of genetics and diet much more easily. Keep your peace girls, no need to obsess over something that's not right for you in the first place. \n\nHope this helped!!",

But of course, I can‚Äôt take that forever.\n\n- Right now, I‚Äôve stopped using any products except a gentle cleanser not even a moisturiser and sunscreen. \n\nI‚Äôd really appreciate it if someone could:\n\n- Help me understand what this condition might be called in medical terms, and\n\n- Suggest a simple, effective skincare routine that I can follow to treat or manage it long-term.\n\nI‚Äôd prefer something that‚Äôs not too harsh or complicated just a routine that actually works.\nThanks in advance.  üôèüèº",

I air dry my hair but looking to get a diffuser \n\nLet me know if there are any better products available as I was using an expensive one in the past but switched up for affordability as going through products fast even with less use \n\nInfo: hair is still wet in the photos, once dry it looks very similar with loose curls and more full on the bottom then top",
