      "content": "Today I saw this Montreal salon charging 45 dollars for “normal” hair cuts and 85 dollars for curly hair cuts and I’m outraged! I know people might think it’s fair because it takes “extra knowledge” but here’s my thing: we naturally grow curly hair out of our heads. 60% of the world’s population does. It makes absolutely no sense to center hair care only around straight hair as the norm, with curly hair as the exception. Beauty schools should mandatorily teach their students how to style curly hair, and to not do so is discrimination. Plus, styling curly hair is not even hard!! It doesn’t take MORE knowledge, it only takes a DIFFERENT set of knowledge than straight hair. I would go as far as to call it racist, given that most people with curly hair are people of color (even though I am not). It’s not our fault our hair grows like this and we should not be made to pay more because of it. Shame on any salon that practices this. \n\n(Since I have to include my hair routine: I wash with Lola’s shampoo and conditioner, and style with Arvensis defining cream and salon line’s gel)",

      "content": "1 - Stick to a routine. Doing CTM daily will give you better results than buying a 3,000 rs serum you use once a week.\n\n2 - If a product suits you, don’t switch just because some influencer said so. I’ve stuck to Clinique moisturiser for 5+ years and it still works.\n\n3 - What you eat shows up on your face. Avoid sugars and oils as much as you can.\n\n4 - CTM (Cleanse, tone, moisturise) is the best advice for most people. You don’t need 10 steps unless you're a professional whose career or work depends on having perfect skin. \n\n5 - Don’t fall for hype. everyone went crazy about that Dot &amp; Key Vitamin C serum and then forgot about it in 2 months? So stick to what has been working for others for years and not stuff that is trending.\n\n6 - Use sunscreen daily. SPF 30+ at least. The minimalist or Re’equil sunscreens are best.\n\n7 - Scrubs are not essential. and you should definitely not use them twice a week. Once every 8–10 days is enough unless you have blackhead-prone skin.\n\n8 - Buy for your skin type, depending on whether it is oily, dry, or a combo. Just because someone on Reddit said snail mucin is great doesn’t mean it’ll suit you.\n\n9 - Go for small sizes. Most people don’t even finish their products before they expire or oxidise which will do more harm than good (those damn vitamin C serums).\n\n10 - IMPORTANT: Don’t store skincare in the same bathroom as your regular shower. heat + steam is really bad for the shelf life of those products, if you must, keep them in a locked cabinet.\n\n11 - Mild cleanser &gt; harsh actives, unless you’re using something prescribed like AHA/BHA. Cetaphil and Simple are safe bets.\n\n12 - Drinking water is good, but it won’t clear your acne. That happens only with skincare + diet + hormones.\n\n13 - Don’t layer 6 products, the actives can clash. Stick to 3–4 max. Example: cleanser, serum, moisturiser, sunscreen.\n\n14 - New products take 3–6 weeks to show results.\n\n15 - Never sleep with makeup, not even tinted sunscreen. Just double clense and go to bed.\n\n16 - KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF YOUR FACE. Girl, you have no idea how dirt your phone is.\n\n17 - Sleep matters. Netflix binges will def show up on your skin.\n\n18 - DIY masks with lemon, toothpaste, or haldi ARE A BIG NO. Ayurvedic stuff is good but only in moderation, most natural chemicals are really bad for your skin because of how little you've been exposed to them.\n\n19 - Don’t blindly follow someone else’s routine. Make your own after experimentation and consultation from dermats.\n\n20 - Good skin isn’t flawless. it’s healthy, hydrated, and consistent. Stop chasing “glass skin” filters. That's marketing and especially for Indians, VERY HARD to achieve. Koreans can get that effect because of genetics and diet much more easily. Keep your peace girls, no need to obsess over something that's not right for you in the first place. \n\nHope this helped!!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

They had Not Your Mother's Kids curl conditioner for about $5, when the other conditioner options where all at least $10 (including the regular not your mothers). I grabbed it since it was cheap. I've used NYM in the past and while it's not my favorite it is usually a good option for me when I can't find my usual options (Pattern, Sun Bum, or Cantu). I've used it once and it seems to work fine for me, so I'm wondering if there's any reason not to regularly use a kid's conditioner as an adult, or if it's just some marketing gimmick. It's half the price so I figure if it works just as well, why not use that instead?\n\nI'm not sure how relevant my routine is for this post, but for reference here's what I usually do:\n\n* shampoo once a week or so with a homemade shampoo bar\n* conditioner every time I shower (products mentioned above)\n* wring out and tshirt plop to dry slightly\n* scrunch in curl cream or mousse (Pattern is my go-to. Lately I've been using mixed chicks but I don't like it)\n* About once a week I'll use sea salt spray (Sun Bum)\n* use a hair drier with a diffuser until just damp, air dry the rest of the way.\n* My hair is shoulder length, 3C",

I tried many things early on — blood tonics, Redensyl, and Minoxidil alone (had to quit due to fast heartbeat and discomfort) ... . Finasteride was very hard to find in Vietnam back then, so I couldn’t use it.\n\nAfter several failed attempts, I gave up and wore a hair system for years. My hair loss eventually progressed to Norwood 7.\n\nIn 2025, a friend recommended supplements like NMN, CoQ10, Fish Oil, and Multivitamin... My overall health improved, so I decided to give hair recovery another try.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n* Hair Pro 4U (Minoxidil + Finasteride) – used intermittently due to mild side effects (fast heartbeat, dandruff)\n* Rosemary oil\n* Kaminomoto Higher Strength – doesn’t regrow much, but helps reduce shedding and keeps the scalp clean\n* Dermastamp (Dr. Pen X8, 1.0mm) – once a week on weekends\n* Biotin 1000mcg, NMN, CoQ10, Fish Oil, Multivitamin\n* L-Theanine + Ashwagandha + Melatonin for better sleep and stress balance\n\nI’ve noticed some small but real improvements, so I’ll keep going and update later.",

      "content": "# Let’s keep talking about the real side of this industry. Not the ads or influencer faces, but what actually happens behind the scenes.\n\nIf a clinic offers hair transplants while also promoting dental work, plastic surgery or other treatments, stay away. That usually means they see this as a business, not a medical field. Their goal isn’t to give you the best result, it’s to make as much money as possible. \n\nMany clinics later start offering extra procedures because they realize they can earn more from their existing patients. But that mindset is dangerous. If you really want good results, choose a clinic that only focuses on hair transplants. There are exceptions, but if you see a clinic offering teeth whitening or nose jobs next to hair transplants, it’s not a good sign. It doesn’t show how successful they are, it shows how desperate they are for more profit.\n\nDon’t take constant discounts or “book before this date” messages seriously. Why would a medical treatment have a seasonal sale? A small discount when you ask for it is fine, but if they offer it without you saying a word, that’s a red flag.\n\nAnd don’t get fooled by fancy words like IceGraft, Sapphire FUE or DHI. These are mostly marketing terms. In skilled hands, the difference between them is minimal.\n\nIf a clinic offers you both FUE and DHI and claims one is better, ask yourself why they are still offering the other. If one method is truly better, the logic just doesn’t add up.\n\nThese kinds of inconsistencies tell you everything you need to know. We’ll keep talking about the truths people rarely share. I don’t recommend any specific clinic, but if you have general questions about the process, I’m happy to help. Next part might surprise some of you...",

I've also tolerated eco style \"black castor and flaxseed\" gel in the past.\n\nPersonally I don't seem to react to those although I'm usually sensitive to panthenol, but I think when it's just in shampoos it gets washed out well enough to not be an issue. With products that stay on my skin and contain panthenol I eventually develop an itchy rash. I also react to avocado and camomile, can't tolerate strong smells and the smell of coconut. There's a lot of products I react to where I'm not even certain what ingredient exactly I react to. ",

Over the summer I started to get dandruff, I just used gentle balancing shampoos because I thought maybe the lice products dried up my scalp. The oiliness never ended. Now in October my hair started to shed so much with sebum plugs which  I never experienced , also got so much dandruff suddenly, the hair when it’s oily gets itchy in some parts.
