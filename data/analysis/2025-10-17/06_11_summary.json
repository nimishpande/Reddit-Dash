      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

It’s not a super strong odor,  more like that slightly sour or “wet towel” smell that comes back once my hair dries.\nI wash my hair every 2–3 days, use a mild shampoo, and rinse really well. I even replaced my pillowcase and cleaned my brush, thinking maybe that was it. But somehow, the smell still lingers sometimes, especially near my scalp.\nIs this just buildup? Product residue? Or could it be my shampoo not cleansing enough? I’d love recommendations for anything that actually keeps hair smelling clean longer.",

      "content": "I've been struggling with what I believe is over-conditioned hair for the past 6 weeks. Before that, my 3b hair was resilient, thick, and naturally dry regardless of how much product I put in. It started feeling mushy, lifeless, and flat when I switched conditioners from Briogeo's Don't Despair Repair deep conditioning mask, to the regular conditioner in that same line. It's like my hair collapsed. The latter seems to have less protein and more emollient. I also believe I was putting in too much leave-in conditioner after wash days (also Briogeo Don't Despair Repair; my go-to for years).\n\nI am shocked by how unresilient my hair is now. It's even become greasy, which is something I've never experienced, and my dry time has decreased as well (both air dry and with a diffuser). I've tried a lot to fix my hair, but I haven't experienced much improvement. It's super demoralizing, as I took a lot of pride in my thick hair. I haven't been shedding an unusual amount, but when I hold my hair in my hands it feels like so much of it is gone.\n\nI have tried a few different routines in attempting to restore my hair to it's normal state:\n\nRoutine 1: Lots of clarifying shampoo (Sauve Daily), with no conditioner to follow up. Basically, I would only shampoo and put no other product in both during the shower and after. My hair would feel very dry from this, understandably so. But it had a lot more body.\n\nRoutine 2: Clarifying shampoo (Sauve Daily) with no conditioner, followed by protein treatment spray (Aphogee leave-in spray). This left my hair feeling too soft and mushy.\n\nRoutine 3: A stronger clarifying shampoo (Neutrogena) with the Briogeo Don't Despair Repair mask. My hair once again felt limp, soft, and body-less.\n\n**Has anyone experienced this before, and does anyone have recommendations for what I can do to fix this?** I've been clarifying consistently for many weeks with little progress. How long should I expect before things improve?",
