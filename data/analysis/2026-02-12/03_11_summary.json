I started doing research and here’s my routine:\n\nWet\n\nNot Your Mothers Defining Curl Talk Cream\n\nBrush\n\nSection off\n\nUse edge brush to wrap curls\n\nThis is reflected in the first picture. The top of her head is straight so I had to do a little baby sprout pony tail after that fell pretty quickly. \n\nThe other photos are her hair just wet, brushed, and kinda “shook out” with my fingers. This was easier but I’m not sure if it’s best for her curls. \n\nShe uses Aussie moisturizing shampoo. We do not condition because her hair is so short. Should I be doing that?\n\nIs my routine right? It seems so long and tedious. What do I do about post nap bedhead? She will not do a bonnet and I’d have to get all silk bedding because she breakdances in her sleep. Is it ok to wet it down and brush it three times a day (morning, post nap, bed time)? \n\nI’m so lost. Mine and my eldest’s hair is pin straight. My friends are recommending a lot of products and to use a cotton shirt or special hair towel. Any other advice is welcome!! \n\nAlso is it normal the top of her head is straight? ",

      "content": "Please help y’all I cant for the life of me find something that my hair actually soaks up. It takes me like 3 hours to do my hair and it’s always a let down because it never comes out juicy. I’m currently growing out my keratin treatments for the first time in my 23 years of life. I have never dealt with my natural hair, I’ve gotten relaxers and keratin treatments my whole life. It’s impossible to deal with its always poofy, the front doesn’t curl its just a poof mess. I’ve tried miche gel and it works a but better than anything else but it still doesn’t help the front clump up and curl.\n\nMY ROUTINE: I don’t really use any curly hair shampoo and conditioner. I use whatever shampoo I find in the bathroom (ik tragic) and I skip conditioner and just go in with  Manuka Honey &amp; mafura oil Intensive hydration hair mask by shea moisture , I steam it with a steamer especially my roots. then I either use jamaican black castor oil strengthen and restore leave in conditioner by shea moisture . If I don’t style then I wait for my hair to air dry and put in a single braid. If I do style, I go in with miche gel in sections, focusing on the roots, and use a define brush. I have to force some type of curl in the front bc it just frizzes up and even when i force a curl it’s an extremely poofy curl in the front. In this particular pic I actually just twisted the fronts and when it dries I separate them a bit so they don’t look like just twists only in the front lol. Then I defuse and I make sure to focus on the roots first so they dry first before anything else. I have low porosity hair so even defusing it takes like an hour because it just takes forever to dry.  At night I use a silk bonnet, and silk scrunchy when i pineapple it.\n\nIdk how to refresh my hair without ruining it either lol so I literally just wet everything, brush it out with any conditioner (i dont have a specific curly conditioner) so i’ll just use the maracuja skala in the shower and rinse it out, and then do the miche gel steps again and defuse.\n\nI have two different curl patterns currently (thank u keratin treatments) so I just need help making the roots juicier and not as dry looking as I transition back to my natural hair. My mom is lowkey my biggest hater when it comes to my hair so I just want to prove her wrong that I can take care of it and I can make it look good.",

Ive recently fixed my hair up from my last post on here(I looked wayyy different lmao!) and I was wondering what products I should use to fix this frizz? I live in a humid area so is it just a lost cost? Genuine question! I use lots of products depending on what Im trying to do but I wonder if its over kill? My routine is shampoo and conditoner in the shower, mousse, heat protection spray, some leave in conditioner, defuse, add a tiny bit of hair oil and in the mornings when I don't wash my hair (I wash it 2 times a week sometimes 3) I use some water out of a spray bottle and some condioning spray, sometimes a tiny bit of hair oil. Is this over kill? What should I do instead for my curls? I dont use a bonnet or curlers should I invest in either of those? I wish my hair would have tighter curls but I'm ok how it is now! Last pic is my hair when I brush it dry (Which Ive stopped doing! This picture is from some time right after I got it cut and lightend!)\n\nThank you!!! ♡♡♡",

I’m looking for some advice or a routine intervention.\n\nAs you can see in the photos, I get these random \"semi-perfect\" curls that actually want to spiral and behave. But the rest of my head? It’s just a frizzy, undefined mess. I know the curls are in there somewhere, but I can’t get them to come out consistently across my whole head.\n\nMy Current Routine (Daily):\n\n1. Wash: Sebamed Everyday Shampoo.\n\n2. Condition: Garnier Banana Hair Food (leave in for 5 mins, then rinse out).\n\n3. Leave-in: Garnier Fructis Aloe Vera Hair Mask (used as a leave-in on wet hair).\n\n4. Technique: Scrunching with a 100% cotton T-shirt.\n\n5. Drying: First, I diffuse with my head upside down (cold/low speed). Then, I let it air dry for a bit while I finish my morning routine. Finally, I finish it off by diffusing with my head right-side up.\n\n6. Finish: Isana Argan Oil scrunched in at the end.\n\n7. Protection: I sleep with a satin bonnet every night.\n\nI’m based in Germany, so I mostly shop at dm or Rossmann. I’m finding that despite this routine, only a few strands clump into that semi-perfect shape while the rest stays chaotic. I'd love to hear your thoughts on why my hair is so inconsistent and what I can do to get the rest of my hair to join the party!",

      "content": "Long-time nail biter here &amp; I finally stopped. I tried to give myself a head start with acrylics. Once they had a little natural length, I soaked them off, then got a gel manicure on the natural nail with some cute designs.\n\nIt’s been about a week and I already had three nails break/peel, several are cracking, and most are super bendy. I know one salon visit isn’t going to undo 25+ years of biting, but it honestly feels like the acrylic set and then gel set made already thin nails even weaker.\n\nI’m thinking I need to go back to basics: let them grow under regular polish and forgo enhancements for now. I’m going to the salon today to get plain polish, but I’d really like some advice on pre-treatments or strengthening routines I can do before or ask them to do first.\n\nSo I guess my questions are:\n\n• Any recommended brands or products (serums, oils, hardeners, etc.) that helped you?\n\n• Any salon-appropriate preps or in-chair treatments I can request?\n\n• Should I avoid certain salon services while building strength?\n\nIt’s discouraging to see progress and then have them snap off, so I want something that actually helps instead of just masking the problem.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Day 1-3 I didn’t have access to aloe Vera or anything helpful. It was so red and bumpy (no pus luckily). Day 4 I went to the dermatologist who advised  putting Vaseline every hour. \n\nThe pics are day 4-6 and trust me the dark areas are darker in person.

I'm getting my hair thinned and trimmed on Tuesday\n\nso I have questions..:\n\n\\- What products should I use to begin with? I don't own any right now I just use whatever my mum has lying around the house..so whatever products you guys think would be good (I'm uk/ireland area if that helps for specific products)\n\n\\- how do I maintain it after day 1, usually I just brush it out because it gets frizzy but I want to stop it from going bad like that\n\n\\- how do I style my hair down...? I never wear my hair down and I haven't since I was 8 so I kinda have no idea how to wear my hair down without it getting in my face or just looking stupid \n\n\\- what's better? bonnet or plopping with the shirt?\n\nokay thats all the questions I could think of rn but any advice is great, I have no clue what I'm doing but it seems to be doing alright just a little frizzy ",
