Lighter products led to more defined waves/curls and healthier looking hair. (Pics 1-4 are scrunched and diffused, last pic is scrunched and air dried)\n\nAs much as I wish my head was all ringlets… that’s not what I was born with, and that’s ok.

I love the soft but grainy texture. I do have to use it twice to get makeup off though. 8/10\n\nVt Reedle shot PDRN 300- the pdrn leaves my skin looking more supple than any other hyaluronic acid I’ve tried. I’m looking at you Torredin. 7/10\n\nD-alba aromatic spray serum- the best mist I’ve tried to rehydrate my skin. I don’t like that you have to shake it before applying because I forget to sometimes….The mist is so fine. 7/10\n\nSkinceuticals phloretin CF- I tried the normal CE version of this serum but it was too greasy and would make my skin looking oily, not glowing from within. This is a staple in my routine now. Best vitamin c I’ve tried. 9/10\n\nI’m from honey mask- nothing gets my skin right back on track quite like this mask. When my brother was going through it with acne, he would beg me for more of this mask. It’s just so good and hydrating. I don’t like how you have to pick it out with your finger though, it doesn’t feel very sterile. 9/10\n\nTatcha the dewy skin cream- no words needed. It’s just the best. 100/10\n\nGlow recipe plum plum cream- I love this formulation for under makeup. It doesn’t leave a film of grease but it’s not a gel either. It’s the perfect in between. I wouldn’t use it with my night time routine thought as it just wouldn’t be enough. 7/10\n\nHaruharu wonder rice essence- I thought this essence was all hype but no bite but I still bought it and omg I’m never using another essence again. This stuff makes my skin actually glow for dayyyys. 1000/10\n\nAnua azalaic acid serum- this is a new incorporation in my routine. I was worried about using 10% on my skin but it has been quite gentle and has been working really well with the vitamin c. 7/10\n\nIlso sebum softener- also a new edition to my routine but it’s going no where. Holy moly this stuff makes my nose look poreless. I’m sure you can get the same effect with any toner and scraping tool though. I just love the procedural feel of this product lol 8.5/10.  \n\n ",

Gil said the first part of the year will be spent engaging with the FDA to confirm the trial design and endpoints.\"\n\nhttps://www.biospace.com/business/were-scientists-pelage-takes-hair-loss-beyond-lotions-and-potions\n\nMore about what is said: \n\n“There were people were running around saying, ‘Oh, this thing works in a week,’ or, ‘You’re gonna have a full head of hair in three weeks,’” he remembered. “\\[It’s\\] nice that people are excited, but of course, you don’t want there to be unreal expectations either.”\n\nInstead, PP405 takes a little bit longer than that and the results are a bit more subtle at first. The Phase IIa trial that read out in June 2025 showed that 31% of male patients with a higher degree of hair loss had a greater than 20% increase in hair density at week eight—which was four weeks after the completion of treatment. No patients in the placebo arm hit this exploratory endpoint.\n\n“Pelage is not alone in the burgeoning alopecia market. Veradermics is developing an oral extended-release version of minoxidil for pattern hair loss, which is in Phase III trials. Gil and Weng believe there could be combination opportunities in the future.\"",

      "content": "I am 26M and I travel a lot on short notice. I will do a normal week in my city and my skin is fine, then I take a weekend trip (usually different climate, lots of walking, late nights, and whatever hotel towels and pillowcases) and by day 2 or 3 my face starts to feel tight and itchy. I get clusters of tiny flesh colored bumps on my cheeks and around my mouth, and my usual moisturizer starts to sting.\n\n  \nI am not looking for a diagnosis, just help troubleshooting what to change first and how to calm things down safely when it happens.\n\n  \nCurrent routine (pretty consistent at home):\n\nAM:\n\n\\- Gentle cleanser\n\n\\- Lightweight moisturizer\n\n\\- SPF 50 (chemical)\n\n  \nPM:\n\n\\- Gentle cleanser\n\n\\- Moisturizer\n\n\\- 2 to 3 nights a week: exfoliating acid (AHA) or a retinoid (I alternate, not both same night)\n\n  \nOn trips I also reapply sunscreen more, and I sometimes use the hotel body wash on my face if I forgot my cleanser (I know, bad).\n\n  \nQuestions:\n\n1) Does this sound more like barrier damage from travel and overdoing actives, or could it be irritation from sunscreen, sweat, or friction?\n\n2) What is the simplest travel routine you would suggest for 3 to 4 days to prevent this?\n\n3) When the stinging starts, should I stop everything except cleanser and moisturizer, or should I even skip cleanser and just rinse?\n\n  \nAny specific ingredient categories to look for or avoid would be helpful. Thanks.",

Conditioner is a no for me as it tends to make my hair poofy, no brand and I mean any brand at all of conditioner has ever worked for me even leave in conditioner. After gently scrunching to remove excess water and I mean GENTLY AS POSSIBLE I apply a small amount of amla oil to 3/4 of my hair with my fingers making sure to evenly distribute the oil, I also apply a homemade all natural oil blend to my scalp (castor, rosemary, pumpkin seed, peppermint and a few others). Ive been using this routine for about 4 months now and my hair has really seemed to like it, my waves and curls have come through more (2 hair types, top is wavy and bottom is more curly. I was wondering if yall had any opinions on this routine and if yall have some recommendations for my routine? I only use natural products as my hair and skin don’t react well with heavy products. Picture above is with my hair still wet from the shower after applying amla, I prefer to let it air dry slowly instead of blow drying as it helps keep the curls.",

Literally the best hair day I think I've had since I got this lazy bob cut. The only thing I think could be better is the frizz, but that's a never ending problem for us curly hair girlies... :V\n\nRoutine: In a warm shower I wash my scalp with Shea Moisture shampoo, comb Shea Moisture conditioner through hair, rinse out conditioner with cold water, scrunch hair with Not Your Mothers Curl Talk, and plop everything with an old t-shirt. Once my hair is dry enough that it isn't soaking, I let it air dry.\n\nPLEASE let me know what else I should introduce into my regiment!! I'm definitely looking for advice. The #1 thing I have noticed that made a big difference is just using more product than you'd assume is needed. I'm also open to trying a different hairstyle (if you think that it would suit me better).",
