It can be a PITA to find a hairdresser who will even do this \\*but\\* if you do find one, it’s often cheaper than even a normal cut as they don’t have to wash your hair.\n\nThe dry cut gets the shape right. Then I go home and wash/style it myself (to get it to curl again - it’s always crazy after a cut), and then I cut it curl by curl.\n\nYou want 2 snips per curl - one on an angle and then one to just take the tip off what you’ve just cut. You’re not trying to change the overall shape of your hair or make it shorter, just a shallow ish angle for the first cut and then the tip for the second. \n\nEach time I wash/style I’ll have a quick look for curls that need a snip, but generally it’s only a few that need a snip for the next couple of washes and I’m good to go until I need a proper cut again. \n\nIt’s actually hilarious cos my current hairdresser makes me send her pics when it’s ‘done’ so she can show other customers, but she doesn’t know I’m doing a secret squirrel curly cut at home after she shapes it 😂\n\nRoutine: professional dry cut, snip, snip!

I will do a normal week in my city and my skin is fine, then I take a weekend trip (usually different climate, lots of walking, late nights, and whatever hotel towels and pillowcases) and by day 2 or 3 my face starts to feel tight and itchy. I get clusters of tiny flesh colored bumps on my cheeks and around my mouth, and my usual moisturizer starts to sting.\n\n  \nI am not looking for a diagnosis, just help troubleshooting what to change first and how to calm things down safely when it happens.\n\n  \nCurrent routine (pretty consistent at home):\n\nAM:\n\n\\- Gentle cleanser\n\n\\- Lightweight moisturizer\n\n\\- SPF 50 (chemical)\n\n  \nPM:\n\n\\- Gentle cleanser\n\n\\- Moisturizer\n\n\\- 2 to 3 nights a week: exfoliating acid (AHA) or a retinoid (I alternate, not both same night)\n\n  \nOn trips I also reapply sunscreen more, and I sometimes use the hotel body wash on my face if I forgot my cleanser (I know, bad).\n\n  \nQuestions:\n\n1) Does this sound more like barrier damage from travel and overdoing actives, or could it be irritation from sunscreen, sweat, or friction?\n\n2) What is the simplest travel routine you would suggest for 3 to 4 days to prevent this?\n\n3) When the stinging starts, should I stop everything except cleanser and moisturizer, or should I even skip cleanser and just rinse?\n\n  \nAny specific ingredient categories to look for or avoid would be helpful. Thanks.",

(They usually are not this bad!)\n\n\\- random pimples popping up in different spots all over the face. \n\n\\- uneven tone and texture.\n\nHonestly, I have been using a bit of everything you see above in my skincare collection. After some research, probably not great!\n\nI would really appreciate some help in getting my skin as best as it can be before the wedding with the products I have. \n\nBonus points if somebody could give me a proper 2 week routine morning and night!

I’m exclusively breastfeeding and I’m hungry all the time, which makes it hard to lose the baby weight. On top of that, my face always looks tired and dull, and I honestly feel like I’ve aged years since giving birth.\n\nI’d really appreciate any tips or advice from other moms on how to take care of yourself postpartum and feel a little more put together again. What helped you?",

Is gel, acrylic, gel powder or SNS dipping powder best for this? I am looking for something simple, not too long, but I actually have zero idea of what any of that means, so I put all the options from their webpage here.\n\nAlso, am I allowed to bring my own nail polish to the salon?

Conditioner is a no for me as it tends to make my hair poofy, no brand and I mean any brand at all of conditioner has ever worked for me even leave in conditioner. After gently scrunching to remove excess water and I mean GENTLY AS POSSIBLE I apply a small amount of amla oil to 3/4 of my hair with my fingers making sure to evenly distribute the oil, I also apply a homemade all natural oil blend to my scalp (castor, rosemary, pumpkin seed, peppermint and a few others). Ive been using this routine for about 4 months now and my hair has really seemed to like it, my waves and curls have come through more (2 hair types, top is wavy and bottom is more curly. I was wondering if yall had any opinions on this routine and if yall have some recommendations for my routine? I only use natural products as my hair and skin don’t react well with heavy products. Picture above is with my hair still wet from the shower after applying amla, I prefer to let it air dry slowly instead of blow drying as it helps keep the curls.",
