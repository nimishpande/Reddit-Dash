      "content": "This is my lovely hair 🫶🏻 she’s been on the struggle bus for about the last two years. I want to add that I’ve avoided posting because I know you guys are about to fry me lol.\n\nI’ll admit I was very fortunate and uneducated in my youth and early adulthood - I could put whatever on her and she flourished.  Her best look was when I was using healthy sexy hairs tri wheat leave in and garniers spray gel. Then one day I thought I should start using actual curly products and it all kinda went to hell from there, slowly but surely. \n\nCurrent routine is:\n\n\\- wash every 2 days with redKen all soft \n\n\\- oribes hair alchemy fortifying treatment for leave in \n\n\\- I’ve tried numerous gels and mousses but the current one I’ve had luck with is miss Jessie’s pillow talk lotion which I comb throughout my hair then scrunch with a t shirt \n\n\\- air dry \n\nYou read all that correctly - I use no masks, have no protein (I just learned this is a big necessity which is wild), etc, no clarifying shampoo, etc.\n\nI’d like to also note I HAVE to wash every 2 days. I have tried and tried to prolong it with a bonnet, wrap, satin pillowcase, etc and my hair wads up and gets oily. Any tips for that is great too! When I do refresh, I use a tiny bit of oribe oil on the tips to give some hydration back to them. \n\nBack when my hair looked its best, I’d like to note how that looked: \n\n\\- wash every day with tresemme moisture shampoo and conditioner\n\n\\- towel dry, and when damp, use healthy sexy hairs tri wheat soy leave in and then brush out with a wet brush (still use this) \n\n\\- garnier spray gel, sprayed throughout then scrunch with hands \n\n\\- air dry \n\nIf you are wondering why I strayed from this - my hair began feeling dry and curling weird, so I swapped things out until my hair was soft again but at the cost of my curls it seems\n\nI’m here because she has really stopped forming full curls around my face and at my root/crown. All of my ringlets start at collarbone level and go to my ends. They also have started tangling together and wadding up (I hope that makes sense.) I’ve began wearing my hair up in a clip to avoid this and i actually have an appointment to cut it to shoulder length again tomorrow (it’s currently a little longer than mid back.) \n\nSo my question is what do I do? What do you recommend? When I began searching, I found a million answers to what I COULD do, but then determined the best route was to actually show you guys my hair and embarrassingly admit that I don’t do much. I need products, a routine, all the things. Is cutting it going to be good for it? I know it’s heavy and weight can impact how it curls up top. Anyway - sos send help and thanks in advance 😭",

These days, I usually just wear NARS tinted moisturizer and some concealer and call it a day. I’ve never had an issue with acne and rarely feel the need to use face wash 😅\n\nI think I have normal skin with some dry areas. I do have sensitive skin in general and will show redness at the slightest touch.\n\nAny recommendations for a first time skincare routine? Preferably drugstore brands or something I can get at Target without spending too much since it will probably be trial &amp; error for a while. I am also 5 months pregnant, so nothing that should be avoided during pregnancy.\n\nI’m looking forward to starting this (late) skincare journey and appreciate all suggestions!!",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

What has worked well for you and what do you not recommend? \n\nI think I’ve really messed up my curl pattern by shampooing (and maybe brushing) way too much, and I would like to fix it but am not sure where to go from here. \n\nMy husband and I own a renovation business and we do literally everything by ourselves, so my hair has been exposed to a lot of icky things but I think the real issues are drywall dust and mortar/grout dust. We don’t do those specific jobs  every day, but when we do do them it takes multiple days. From just minimal exposure, the dust typically causes my hair to matte and is pretty unmanageable, so I was trying to get ahead of the curve and just keep it as clean as possible and I messed it up. \n\nWhen I’m working with stuff that I know messes up my hair, I wear a little slouchy hat/hair covering (sorry I’m not sure the right word for it!) but it feels like a lot of the dust still gets through. \n\nI’d appreciate any guidance or suggestions! \n\nRoutine:\n\nSome of these are very recent additions( bought this week) and I’m already seeing progress! \n\nNew Products: \n\nPattern Bounce Back Pre-Poo (used once do far, didn’t shampoo afterwards bc I’m trying to get my scalp back to its natural oil level)\n\nPattern Leave In Conditioner \n\nPattern Jojoba oil blend \n\nRizzos Curls Brush (literally the first time I’ve been able to brush my hair without so much pain lol) \n\nRegular products: \n\nPattern Hydrating Shampoo\n\nPattern Lightweight Conditioner \n\nI don’t really have a specific schedule or specific routine, I just go with what feel right on whatever day \n\nThank you!!",

I'd greatly appreciate some updated information, if possible.\n\nI still have quite a few baby/vellus hairs on my widow's peak, perhaps remnants of what used to be a lush jungle of hair in my youth.

My hair is on a twice a week wash cycle and gets a hair cover to stay dry in the shower the rest of the week, I assume the bangs will get greasier faster than the rest of my hair.\n\nI’m also not a huge fan of having hair in my face and often keep it up, so I am looking into styles that are cute with hair being up on the back, but am I just asking to be constantly touching my face if I go in this direction? Am\n\nI way overthinking on something I can “reverse” after a few months of grow out (probably). \n\nI appreciate any opinions advice or help, I want to feel good about my hair, but not have to endure months of frustration if it’s something I’ll regret ",

I don't feel like my skin or brows are particularly oily so my next thought is perhaps the length of my brow hairs is contributing to the problem?  I've even resorted to rolling my spoolie in hairspray to help hold and still have the issue of them kinda falling within mins.\n\nAnyway, I want to see if trimming them down will help but I'm a lefty so I worry that most brow scissors won't work for me (as with standard scissors I absolutely need lefty designated pairs or I have to make serious efforts using my right hand and I'm not about to lose an eye over poor hand mechanics).\n\nAre there any lefties out there that have had success with any decent quality brand of brow scissors out there?
