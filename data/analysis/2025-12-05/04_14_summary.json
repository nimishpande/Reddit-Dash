      "title": "[Acne][Before&amp;After] 4+ years of inflammation gone overnight! Clean your washing machine!!",
      "content": "Throwaway since I feel weird about posting my face, but I’m in shock. Since I moved to this place 4-5 years ago, my face has been constantly red, bumpy, itchy and inflamed with occasional worsening flare-ups. I have tried various soaps, cleansers and laundry detergents but nothing would fix my face. I thought it must be from stress or eating too much sugar.\n\nLike 2 days ago, I saw a random comment about someone’s washing machine agitator being filthy and making their clothes dirty. I had a weird hunch and checked to see if mine was similar. The cap popped right off to reveal that my machine has been spinning disgusting water through my clothes. I deep-cleaned my washer and re-washed all my fabrics. Then I looked up fungal acne, which led to me putting Lotrimin Ultra all over my face overnight. I also tried Head &amp; Shoulders Bare for my constantly itchy scalp. I figured I would wake up looking even worse, but the itchiness and most of the bumpiness and inflammation disappeared overnight.\n\nI never post about skincare, but this was such a win I felt like I had to share for anyone with similar problems. The pics of my face were taken about 16 hours apart. If your skin problems are anything like mine and nothing else has worked, look into antifungal products and thoroughly check and clean whatever you use to wash your clothes! I didn’t even know my washing machine easily came apart, or that it could get gross inside like it did! From the outside it looked totally clean. My clothes have always seemed clean but with a very slight musty feel/scent after coming out of the dryer. After cleaning the washing machine, my clothes feel much softer with no odor at all.\n\nI hope this helps someone! 🙂\n\nEdit for full routine: For AM, I use CosRX Low pH Good Morning Cleanser, and PM I use CosRX Snail Mucin Cleanser. I moisturize with Neutrogina Hydro Boost Water Gel in the morning and at night. These are the only products I’ve consistently used the past few years. Everything else I tried seemed to make my complexion noticeably worse.",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

She told me the hand situation is eczema. Prescribed me a steroid cream but I haven't used it so far. Probably won't use it. \n\n\n- Added a pinch of salt in my water bottles daily. 2-3L water w lemon and salt.\n\n- I drank coconut water in the morning. 2-3 days only. \n\n- Moisturized a LOTTTTT. Used CeraVe cream. Bioderma atoderm. \n\n- Amd I avoided washing my hands more than necessary.\n\n\nThe sandpaper-y texture near the valley of fingers has gone down 70%. Hands feel normal again. Knuckles feel not as raw and scale-y as earlier.\n\n\nI don't know what worked but yeah my hands don't burn or feel streched near the knuckles anymore.",

      "content": "Hi! I've only recently begun to try learning how to take care of my hair. It is extremely thick, coarse, and wavy, my hair stylist has told me how blessed I am lol. It is SO hard for me to manage and style but I'm chalking that up to a lack of knowledge. I've started building up a routine and styled my hair according to what I already had on hand and it's probably the best its looked so far! I bought a few new products and just wanted to see if I should add or change anything before I buy more. I did start getting highlights recently so that has added some complexity as well.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nDaily: Biolage Ultra Hydra Source leave-in cream on WET hair immediately after shower. After this I slick my hair back (after adding the style cream on wash day) and shake it like a wet dog to let my hair fall down into its natural texture. Then I'll look in the mirror and do some minor fixes to let it look a little less frizzy. I just let my hair air dry after this.\n\nWash every 3 days: Joico Moisture Recovery shampoo &amp; conditioner (I used to use Biolage Ultra Hydra Source and I'm likely switching back to it at the end of the month!), after using leave-in add Paul Mitchell Soft Style Fast Form cream using the praying hands (I think I'm doing that part right?) technique\n\nOnce a week: Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate pre-shampoo intensive treatment, replace conditioner with Joico Moisture Recovery Treatment Balm (also replacing this with Biolage Ultra Hydra Source deep treatment at the end of the month)\n\nAnd then, I just bought Biolage Scalp Sync Clarifying shampoo, so I have not begun to do that yet as it is something I just recently learned I should do. It arrives in the mail tomorrow and then I'll use it once a month, probably?\n\nAttached is how my hair looked after this routine (probably the best its ever looked), and...how my hair usually looks bc I just run a comb through it 😬\n\nJust wondering if I should try something other than Ultra Hydra Source before the liter sale at Ulta starts and if I'm missing anything! Or if you even have recommendations on haircuts or anything else at the salon, because I've been desperate to find one that fits me best! For years I've just done a 1/4\" shave on the sides and a trim on the top, sometimes with texturizing shears to thin it out, and I don't think it's the best cut for me. Thank you so much!",

I've tried researching some videos, asking Google 10 different ways, but still not sure on the best method to consistently achieve this result. Is it a process of manipulating my bangs to fall this way for a certain amount of time at first, before they naturally acclimate? Do I need certain tools / products to get there?\n\nFor reference, I usually blowout my hair with a l'ange barrel blowout brush. I have very thick, naturally curly hair, its about mid-back length &amp; not only is it very thick, its dense too - i have alot of hair. Unsure if these details make any difference so including just in case. \n\nAny tips, advice, tricks, recommendations... all very much appreciated! 🫶🏼",

I have fine, low-porosity curls that are extremely dry, and I live in a cold climate (not sure if that matters). No matter what I do, my hair never lasts more than a day, and even on wash day, I’m rarely happy with how it looks.\n\nI’ve tried everything, sleeping with a bonnet and silk pillowcase, Olaplex and K18 treatments, high-end styling products, different Denman/curly brushes, clarifying and hydrating shampoos, leave-ins, deep treatments, protein vs moisture experiments, oils, even splurging on a Dyson dryer and a steamer. I’ve done all the “right” things, but my hair still looks flat, dry, and undefined. It never feels healthy or shiny, and I honestly don’t even know my curl type anymore because it’s so lifeless.\n\nTo make it look halfway decent, I have to completely wet and restyle section by section every single day, I can’t just take off my bonnet and shake it out. I limit slick backs and avoid tension, but nothing changes. I’ve started wondering if this is just my hair and I need to accept it, but deep down, I’m not convinced. I want those gorgeous, bouncy, shiny curls everyone talks about, and I feel like something is missing.\nPics for reference:\n\nFirst photo is right after a wash day. The rest are day 2 onward/how my hair generally looks.\nIf anyone has tips, routines, or product suggestions that could help, please share, I’m desperate!\n\nROUTINE: \nFor wash day, I alternate between K18 shampoo and curl smith hydrating shampoo followed by K18 conditioner. For styling I layer Curlsmith Frizz Retainer Jelly Styler, Curlsmith Volume Mousse, and Innersense ‘I Create Hold’, then dry with my Dyson dryer.\n\n",

      "content": "**Most people buy sunscreen** by looking at SPF 50 or SPF 30; but SPF only tells part of the story. To truly protect your skin, especially in India, you need to understand **SPF + PA.**\n\n**1. SPF = Sun Protection Factor against UVB** **(\"Burn + Tanning\" rays)**\n\n* SPF measures rays filtering duration strength, not the duration you can stay in the sun\n* Simple rule **SPF 30-50** is ideal for daily Indian sun\n* SPF 30 filters \\~97% of UVB and SPF 50 filters \\~98%, diminishing returns\n* Think of SPF as an umbrella, higher SPF = fewer UVB rays slip through\n* Memory bank:  **B** in UV**B** = **B**urn\n\n**2. PA = Protection against UVA (\"Deep damage + Pigmentation\" rays)**\n\n* UVA rays penetrate deeper, they cause pigmentation, premature ageing &amp; long-term damage\n* **PA rating** tells you how much UVA protection your sunscreen gives:\n   * PA+ = some\n   * PA++ = moderate\n   * PA+++ = high\n   * PA++++ = very high\n* For Indian skin, choose **PA+++ or PA++++** to help prevent tanning &amp; pigmentation\n* Memory bank:  **A** in UV**A** = **A**geing\n\n**3. Why SPF + PA matter together**\n\n* SPF alone won't protect you from long-term UV damage (pigmentation, dark-spots)\n* Look for SPF 30 - 50 **with** PA+++ or PA++++\n* This is called a \"**Broad Spectrum**\" sunscreen. It covers both UVA + UVB\n\n**4. Beginner-friendly Sunscreen checklist**\n\n* SPF 30 - 50\n* PA+++ or PA++++\n* Non-greasy or gel texture (great for humidity)\n* ^(1/2) **teaspoon** for face + neck\n* Reapply every **2 hours** if outdoors, sweating or wiping your face\n* Start simple, no need for expensive or complicated products\n* Check: What is the UV Index today? UV index ≥ 3; protect asap\n\n**5. Common questions picked up on Reddit (and safe solutions)**\n\n* **S**hiny, white cast / grey tone = Try chemical filters sunscreens, matte or tinted options\n* **U**nder humid weather, greasy/sweaty = Look for gel, water-based formulations\n* **N**ot sure, products expensive = Budget-friendly: Minimalist, Re'queil, Fixderma, Pharma\n* **S**till tanning = Use enough amount, choose SPF 50 **+** PA+++ or PA++++\n* **C**an't remember to apply = Use a UV Index free app, build a protection habit\n* **R**eally worried sunscreen causes Vit-D deficiency = It reduces burning, not all UV\n* **E**ver wonder about SPF 100 vs SPF 50 = Not double protection, difference is small\n* **E**ven indoors? = UVA can enter through windows &amp; cause pigmentation over-time\n* **N**ot sure what to pick = Prioritise comfort + protection. Stay NAFE safe.\n\n**Takeaway:** Sunscreen reduces UV damage &amp; long-term risks, it doesn’t block all tanning. Start small, apply correct amount, protect consistently and give your skin the chance to repair itself.\n\nBon SkinVoyage!\n\nSearch this community for my earlier post:  \n**Healthy Skin 101: Which SPF fact has surprised you the most in your skincare journey?**",

When I get an occasional pimple, I use a pimple patch until the pimples gone then liquid from Vitamin E capsules to heal any scarring. I’m not prone to breakouts and also cannot keep up with anything more complex to be honest. \n\nI want to start implementing something that helps clear and minimize my pores, particularly between my eyebrows, on my nose, and my cheeks near my nose. I started using the Korean oil cleanser about a year ago to maybe help with this, and while it’s been great for acne prevention it hasn’t done much to help with my pores. I’ve used Paula’s Choice BHA exfoliant in the past and I liked it, but it dried out my skin a bit too much in these areas. I was using a different moisturizer then, though, so maybe that was the issue. I truly don’t know anything about skincare so all advice is welcome, thanks!!",

      "content": "Hi! As you can see in the photos, my skin looks rough. It doesn't look as bad in the pictures, but my skin has become really dry and bumpy over the past few weeks.\n\nThis past month a lot has happened:\n\nDuring week 1, my skin was fine. I would get a couple pimples every now and then which I would just ignore. I continued to use Lacura's moisturising facial wash with body moisturiser on my face (as my original moisturiser ran out), as well as Vitamin C serum every 2-3 days. All was fine.\n\nDuring week 2, I broke out horribly. I continued to use the facial cleanser and the body moisturiser and I began getting rough textured skin. At a point during the week, I went to Superdrug to buy their Solait Sensitive Face Suncreen as well as their Vitamin C Serum and I think I reacted to an ingredient overnight because my skin was so much worse in the morning. My skin was so dry and bumpy all over. I didn't let it breathe as I tend to wear makeup to college pretty much everyday (as I feel quite insecure without it), so I'd just wash it off after college and continue with the same routine.\n\nAt the start of week 3, I asked my mum to buy me some tumeric soap as well as Dr Althea's 345 Relief Cream. I started using the relief cream and my skin was starting to heal. It looked much better by Friday. I also went to return the Superdrug products.\n\nIt's currently week 4 and I think I've messed up again. At some point during the week, i decided to put a differwnt vitamin c serum on my face before bed and I broke out. It's even worse than before. Everything apply to my face burns. Even the relief cream. Last time I used it was back in July and it worked wonders for me, but now it burns for a couple minutes before calming. I'm trying to go to college without makeup to let my skin breathe a little more, but I can't help but feel so insecure about my skin and the tight feeling it has in general.\n\nI will continue to try to go to college with less makeup, as well as try out Dr Althea's 147 Barrier Cream, which is on the way, to see if it works better than the relief cream, but if you have any advice on what I should do or use, please please let me know!!",

      "content": "I'm in my early twenties and get told regularly that I look as if I'm still freshly in high school. I noticed that I have a lot of features that just make me look a lot younger than my age group, such as having a much smaller nose, rounder face, and big round eyes. This really bothers me though because I don't like it when others call me a baby or need to ask me for my ID to prove if I'm legally old enough for certain things. Even when I tell people that I'm in my 3rd year of college they cannot believe it, or when I mention that I have my own place since they assume I'm a little teenager. I'm not that tall either, so that doesn't help. On the contrary, my boyfriend is only a year older but actually looks his age, so people don't really assume he is younger than what he is. I don't want to do anything to my face that would damage it since I like how I look and know that I would age well with my young-looking features. But, I do really want to find something to make me look my age. I don't like having people give me weird looks and ask my age constantly-- I find it pretty bothersome and rude for people to ask of my age, but at the same time I understand why they would. Are there any makeup tricks to at least help me look more my age?",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

During the pandemic, when I was wearing a mask everyday, I got painful cystic-like acne breakouts on my chin/mouth area. I went to a dermatologist and was prescribed tretinoin which helped tremendously.\n\nAfter using tret for a while (I would say about a year, possibly longer) my skin was clear and I had no breakouts as long as I stayed consistent. After the prescription ran out and some changes that made me financially unable to see a dermatologist, I switched over to OTC adapalene.\n\nMy current routine is (and has been for the past year or so)\n\nMorning- wash with cerave foaming cleanser and moisturize with SPF facial moisturizer (usually target brand)\n\nEvening- wash with cerave, apply cerave moisturizing cream, then adapalene on top (about 10 minutes later once moisturizer has absorbed)\n\nI have been using cerave products for a LONG time\n\nThis routine has been working great for me until these past few weeks. All of a sudden, my chin is in a state of constant breakout with new pimples forming before older ones have even had a chance to heal up.\n\nMy diet hasn’t changed, my medications haven’t changed. Unless I am completely oblivious, it seems that none of my routines have changed.\n\nI am at a loss. Any and all advice or thoughts appreciated.",
