      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Throwaway since I feel weird about posting my face, but I’m in shock. Since I moved to this place 4-5 years ago, my face has been constantly red, bumpy, itchy and inflamed with occasional worsening flare-ups. I have tried various soaps, cleansers and laundry detergents but nothing would fix my face. I thought it must be from stress or eating too much sugar.\n\nLike 2 days ago, I saw a random comment about someone’s washing machine agitator being filthy and making their clothes dirty. I had a weird hunch and checked to see if mine was similar. The cap popped right off to reveal that my machine has been spinning disgusting water through my clothes. I deep-cleaned my washer and re-washed all my fabrics. Then I looked up fungal acne, which led to me putting Lotrimin Ultra all over my face overnight. I also tried Head &amp; Shoulders Bare for my constantly itchy scalp. I figured I would wake up looking even worse, but the itchiness and most of the bumpiness and inflammation disappeared overnight.\n\nI never post about skincare, but this was such a win I felt like I had to share for anyone with similar problems. The pics of my face were taken about 16 hours apart. If your skin problems are anything like mine and nothing else has worked, look into antifungal products and thoroughly check and clean whatever you use to wash your clothes! I didn’t even know my washing machine easily came apart, or that it could get gross inside like it did! From the outside it looked totally clean. My clothes have always seemed clean but with a very slight musty feel/scent after coming out of the dryer. After cleaning the washing machine, my clothes feel much softer with no odor at all.\n\nI hope this helps someone! 🙂\n\nEdit for full routine: For AM, I use CosRX Low pH Good Morning Cleanser, and PM I use CosRX Snail Mucin Cleanser. I moisturize with Neutrogina Hydro Boost Water Gel in the morning and at night. These are the only products I’ve consistently used the past few years. Everything else I tried seemed to make my complexion noticeably worse.",

Probably won't use it. \n\n\n- Added a pinch of salt in my water bottles daily. 2-3L water w lemon and salt.\n\n- I drank coconut water in the morning. 2-3 days only. \n\n- Moisturized a LOTTTTT. Used CeraVe cream. Bioderma atoderm. \n\n- Amd I avoided washing my hands more than necessary.\n\n\nThe sandpaper-y texture near the valley of fingers has gone down 70%. Hands feel normal again.

I noticed that I have a lot of features that just make me look a lot younger than my age group, such as having a much smaller nose, rounder face, and big round eyes. This really bothers me though because I don't like it when others call me a baby or need to ask me for my ID to prove if I'm legally old enough for certain things. Even when I tell people that I'm in my 3rd year of college they cannot believe it, or when I mention that I have my own place since they assume I'm a little teenager. I'm not that tall either, so that doesn't help. On the contrary, my boyfriend is only a year older but actually looks his age, so people don't really assume he is younger than what he is. I don't want to do anything to my face that would damage it since I like how I look and know that I would age well with my young-looking features. But, I do really want to find something to make me look my age. I don't like having people give me weird looks and ask my age constantly-- I find it pretty bothersome and rude for people to ask of my age, but at the same time I understand why they would. Are there any makeup tricks to at least help me look more my age?",

Usually, I cleanse my face with the CeraVe Foaming Cleanser in the AM and PM, and then I’ll wash my face with PanOxyl after that. I then lather on the CeraVe lotion, and place the differin gel wherever I have acne. I also use the mederma advanced scar gel around my sideburns and my chin where I have acne scars. These days, I‘ve been breaking out on my cheeks and chin, and my skin is peeling in those areas as well. I’m guessing it’s because the products I use are very strong, but I don’t know what I should replace them with. I also am not very good at following the routine every single morning and night, so could that also be the reason why I have very persistent breakouts? Please provide me with some advice if you can!

I do take prescription vitamin d but honestly it hasn't been making that much of a difference and I get the sane amount of sleep and water is was getting a few months ago when my skin was glowing so im not sure what else to do other than seeing if i can find a different product to try. Right now im using the CeraVe under eye repair because that's what ive used in the past and im not noticing too much of a difference yet but its only been a week so im not expecting too much but I wanted to see if anyone of the products ive listed above would be good fpr my situation or if anyone else had some different product reccomendations.

      "content": "I've struggled with acne on and off for several years now, but over the past couple of years I seem to have developed some sort of lingering acne/texture on my forehead. Some of it seems to be in the form of closed comedones, and the texture of the skin is bad as well.\n\nI currently use tazarotene and azelaic acid as the only actives in my routine (2-3 times a week each) a cetaphil gentle cleanser, sunscreen(boj/skin1004), barrier repair moisturizer (aestura and atoderm) and oil cleanser occasionally. I used tretinoin before and faced the same issue.\n\nThough right now I'm going through a little bit of a purge due to increasing taz concentration, apart from the active acne on my forehead, it's usually what it looks like. I have used a lot of different products and actives in my routine and the one thing that's stayed the same is my forehead, even when the rest of my skin was good, and I'm not sure how to fix it for good. I have seb derm in my scalp, though I'm not sure if its related.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar issues before and has any suggestions or advice it'd be much appreciated. I think l've covered everything here but may make an edit if i can add more context. Thank you!",
