      "content": "I’ve been using the Dot &amp; Key Vitamin C + SPF 50 sunscreen for a month straight. I bought it after seeing all the ads and I regretted it for a sec much since everyone bashed it but honestly, here is my hot take based just on my experience: \n\nPros: Leaves no white cast on my face. I layer it with a Serum, Moisturizer and then sunscreen but it hardly feels oily (maybe cuz I have dull skin). The texture feels good on the skin and mixes well. Feels very light. I hate the feeling of being plastered when I apply sunscreen so this felt good for a change.\n\nCons: Everyone keeps saying the SPF protection is not as good. I personally didn’t feel that way, since my face didn’t get any darker. It did give it a subtle suppleness, and i am getting no unwanted tan yet either. \n\nI think i’m gonna stick with it irrespective of what i might hear, if something works for you- it works! It is what it is. \n",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

A lot of people see a dude with a horseshoe and say \"Shave that already!\" and in some cases they might be right. But I’m starting to think the popularity of that advice has less to do with hair and more to do with how we dress now.  \n  \nIt used to be the case that if you were in your 30s during the 1950s and going bald, you were most likely already wearing a suit and dress shoes. Nowadays however you'd probably find yourself in a band tee and a pair of Nikes. It seems to me that this is what creates a weird visual mismatch — less “aging naturally” and more “overgrown man-child\", leading people to adopt the cue ball look to maintain some form of \"youthfulness\", if you could even call it that.  \n  \nDo you think the modern shaved-head trend is really about hair… or is it about the clash between baldness and casual, youthful looks?",

BUT I think I’ve figured out why, I’m just not sure what to do about it.\n\nI’ve realized that my hair used to be very healthy, shiny, springy, voluminous, and curly when I lived in my hometown with hard water, and it looks terrible now that I moved somewhere with soft water. It’s mushy, soft, weighed down, and doesn’t hold a curl whatsoever no matter what I do. I recently visited my hometown and one wash was all it took for my hair to revive (thank god!) \n\nDoes anyone have advice on what to do to combat the effects of soft water? I can’t bear to see my hair completely wrecked anymore ):\nFor reference, the first photo is my hair when I use hard water and the second is when I use soft water.\n\nRoutine:\nShampoo - Kristin ess (weekly), Odele (clarifying)\nDeep conditioner - NYM Naturals, Shea Moisture Manuka Honey\nStyling - Pattern leave-in, Kinky Curly gel or Design Essentials mousse (style with denman brush and diffuse with cool air)\n",

She told me the hand situation is eczema. Prescribed me a steroid cream but I haven't used it so far. Probably won't use it. \n\n\n- Added a pinch of salt in my water bottles daily. 2-3L water w lemon and salt.\n\n- I drank coconut water in the morning. 2-3 days only. \n\n- Moisturized a LOTTTTT. Used CeraVe cream. Bioderma atoderm. \n\n- Amd I avoided washing my hands more than necessary.\n\n\nThe sandpaper-y texture near the valley of fingers has gone down 70%. Hands feel normal again. Knuckles feel not as raw and scale-y as earlier.\n\n\nI don't know what worked but yeah my hands don't burn or feel streched near the knuckles anymore.",

      "content": "**Most people buy sunscreen** by looking at SPF 50 or SPF 30; but SPF only tells part of the story. To truly protect your skin, especially in India, you need to understand **SPF + PA.**\n\n**1. SPF = Sun Protection Factor against UVB** **(\"Burn + Tanning\" rays)**\n\n* SPF measures rays filtering duration strength, not the duration you can stay in the sun\n* Simple rule **SPF 30-50** is ideal for daily Indian sun\n* SPF 30 filters \\~97% of UVB and SPF 50 filters \\~98%, diminishing returns\n* Think of SPF as an umbrella, higher SPF = fewer UVB rays slip through\n* Memory bank:  **B** in UV**B** = **B**urn\n\n**2. PA = Protection against UVA (\"Deep damage + Pigmentation\" rays)**\n\n* UVA rays penetrate deeper, they cause pigmentation, premature ageing &amp; long-term damage\n* **PA rating** tells you how much UVA protection your sunscreen gives:\n   * PA+ = some\n   * PA++ = moderate\n   * PA+++ = high\n   * PA++++ = very high\n* For Indian skin, choose **PA+++ or PA++++** to help prevent tanning &amp; pigmentation\n* Memory bank:  **A** in UV**A** = **A**geing\n\n**3. Why SPF + PA matter together**\n\n* SPF alone won't protect you from long-term UV damage (pigmentation, dark-spots)\n* Look for SPF 30 - 50 **with** PA+++ or PA++++\n* This is called a \"**Broad Spectrum**\" sunscreen. It covers both UVA + UVB\n\n**4. Beginner-friendly Sunscreen checklist**\n\n* SPF 30 - 50\n* PA+++ or PA++++\n* Non-greasy or gel texture (great for humidity)\n* ^(1/2) **teaspoon** for face + neck\n* Reapply every **2 hours** if outdoors, sweating or wiping your face\n* Start simple, no need for expensive or complicated products\n* Check: What is the UV Index today? UV index ≥ 3; protect asap\n\n**5. Common questions picked up on Reddit (and safe solutions)**\n\n* **S**hiny, white cast / grey tone = Try chemical filters sunscreens, matte or tinted options\n* **U**nder humid weather, greasy/sweaty = Look for gel, water-based formulations\n* **N**ot sure, products expensive = Budget-friendly: Minimalist, Re'queil, Fixderma, Pharma\n* **S**till tanning = Use enough amount, choose SPF 50 **+** PA+++ or PA++++\n* **C**an't remember to apply = Use a UV Index free app, build a protection habit\n* **R**eally worried sunscreen causes Vit-D deficiency = It reduces burning, not all UV\n* **E**ver wonder about SPF 100 vs SPF 50 = Not double protection, difference is small\n* **E**ven indoors? = UVA can enter through windows &amp; cause pigmentation over-time\n* **N**ot sure what to pick = Prioritise comfort + protection. Stay NAFE safe.\n\n**Takeaway:** Sunscreen reduces UV damage &amp; long-term risks, it doesn’t block all tanning. Start small, apply correct amount, protect consistently and give your skin the chance to repair itself.\n\nBon SkinVoyage!\n\nSearch this community for my earlier post:  \n**Healthy Skin 101: Which SPF fact has surprised you the most in your skincare journey?**",

I just don't know how to style this.\n\nI have an appointment at the hair dresser next week and I am thinking about chopping it off. But I also love long hair so I don't know if I should.\n\nWhat do you think? I would be happy about any advice! What do you think suits me best? Any recommendations what to do with my bangs?\n\nPicture 1+2 is when I blow dry \nPicture 3 is airdried\nPicture 4+5 is what I am thinking to do.\n\nSidenotes:\n- I am letting my blonde tips grow out atm because I don't have the money to mantain it. \n- I use shampoo for curly hair, leave in conditioner (Redken one united) and Hairoil (Moroccan Oil). Now and then a face mask for damaged hair and a cleansing shampoo by redken, as I usually go 5-6 days between washes.",

The right side of my smile stretches more and looks looser, while the left side feels more stiff in comparison. I’ve also noticed that:\n\n- My right eye squints more when I smile\n- There is a bit more skin fold under my right eye than the left\n\nAt rest my face looks mostly fine, but when I smile, especially in back camera photos, my face starts to look  deformed or uneven, which somewhere affect my confidence.\n\nI just wanted to ask:\n\n- Has anyone else dealt with something like this?\n- Did it get better or worse over time?\n- Did anything help  exercises, habits, posture changes, dentist visit, physio, etc.?\n\nI don’t have any history of facial injury or surgery. I’m mainly looking for shared experiences and practical advice.\n\nThank you to anyone who takes the time to reply 🤍",

The wounds have healed and the scabs have fallen off, but the new skin is pink and there’s a slightly deeper area in the centre of my cheekbone wound. I’m really anxious about scarring because it’s on my face and I’m supposed to attend important events in the coming months.\n\nCan anyone who has gone through similar facial abrasions guide me on:\n\t•\tWhat helped your pink skin blend back to normal?\n\t•\tHow long it took for the skin texture and colour to even out?\n\t•\tDaily care tips to prevent scars and hyperpigmentation?\n\t•\tAny precautions I should keep in mind during the first few weeks of healing?\n\nI’m already following my doctor’s instructions, but I’d love to hear real experiences and advice from people who recovered without scars.\n\nThanks a lot!\n",

I have fine, low-porosity curls that are extremely dry, and I live in a cold climate (not sure if that matters). No matter what I do, my hair never lasts more than a day, and even on wash day, I’m rarely happy with how it looks.\n\nI’ve tried everything, sleeping with a bonnet and silk pillowcase, Olaplex and K18 treatments, high-end styling products, different Denman/curly brushes, clarifying and hydrating shampoos, leave-ins, deep treatments, protein vs moisture experiments, oils, even splurging on a Dyson dryer and a steamer. I’ve done all the “right” things, but my hair still looks flat, dry, and undefined. It never feels healthy or shiny, and I honestly don’t even know my curl type anymore because it’s so lifeless.\n\nTo make it look halfway decent, I have to completely wet and restyle section by section every single day, I can’t just take off my bonnet and shake it out. I limit slick backs and avoid tension, but nothing changes. I’ve started wondering if this is just my hair and I need to accept it, but deep down, I’m not convinced. I want those gorgeous, bouncy, shiny curls everyone talks about, and I feel like something is missing.\nPics for reference:\n\nFirst photo is right after a wash day. The rest are day 2 onward/how my hair generally looks.\nIf anyone has tips, routines, or product suggestions that could help, please share, I’m desperate!\n\nROUTINE: \nFor wash day, I alternate between K18 shampoo and curl smith hydrating shampoo followed by K18 conditioner. For styling I layer Curlsmith Frizz Retainer Jelly Styler, Curlsmith Volume Mousse, and Innersense ‘I Create Hold’, then dry with my Dyson dryer.\n\n",

I’m not super interested in the idea of cutting it, as I want to preserve time and length as much as I can. However, I’m beginning to become annoyed with the way it looks. My mom suggested putting it in braids, but I’m not sure how appropriate culturally that is. I’d love to put it in braids as I think they’re super cool and it’d let my hair grow out for a while without me having to deal with it. Is this possible for me? If not, any ideas? I don’t have a routine for it really, I use light shampoo and a ton of conditioner on it a couple times a week, I use a bonnet occasionally, and sometimes I put a little concoction of serum, gel, cream, and mousse on it to keep frizz a little more minimal.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
