      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

A lot of people see a dude with a horseshoe and say \"Shave that already!\" and in some cases they might be right. But I’m starting to think the popularity of that advice has less to do with hair and more to do with how we dress now.  \n  \nIt used to be the case that if you were in your 30s during the 1950s and going bald, you were most likely already wearing a suit and dress shoes. Nowadays however you'd probably find yourself in a band tee and a pair of Nikes. It seems to me that this is what creates a weird visual mismatch — less “aging naturally” and more “overgrown man-child\", leading people to adopt the cue ball look to maintain some form of \"youthfulness\", if you could even call it that.  \n  \nDo you think the modern shaved-head trend is really about hair… or is it about the clash between baldness and casual, youthful looks?",

Probably won't use it. \n\n\n- Added a pinch of salt in my water bottles daily. 2-3L water w lemon and salt.\n\n- I drank coconut water in the morning. 2-3 days only. \n\n- Moisturized a LOTTTTT. Used CeraVe cream. Bioderma atoderm. \n\n- Amd I avoided washing my hands more than necessary.\n\n\nThe sandpaper-y texture near the valley of fingers has gone down 70%. Hands feel normal again.

      "content": "**Most people buy sunscreen** by looking at SPF 50 or SPF 30; but SPF only tells part of the story. To truly protect your skin, especially in India, you need to understand **SPF + PA.**\n\n**1. SPF = Sun Protection Factor against UVB** **(\"Burn + Tanning\" rays)**\n\n* SPF measures rays filtering duration strength, not the duration you can stay in the sun\n* Simple rule **SPF 30-50** is ideal for daily Indian sun\n* SPF 30 filters \\~97% of UVB and SPF 50 filters \\~98%, diminishing returns\n* Think of SPF as an umbrella, higher SPF = fewer UVB rays slip through\n* Memory bank:  **B** in UV**B** = **B**urn\n\n**2. PA = Protection against UVA (\"Deep damage + Pigmentation\" rays)**\n\n* UVA rays penetrate deeper, they cause pigmentation, premature ageing &amp; long-term damage\n* **PA rating** tells you how much UVA protection your sunscreen gives:\n   * PA+ = some\n   * PA++ = moderate\n   * PA+++ = high\n   * PA++++ = very high\n* For Indian skin, choose **PA+++ or PA++++** to help prevent tanning &amp; pigmentation\n* Memory bank:  **A** in UV**A** = **A**geing\n\n**3. Why SPF + PA matter together**\n\n* SPF alone won't protect you from long-term UV damage (pigmentation, dark-spots)\n* Look for SPF 30 - 50 **with** PA+++ or PA++++\n* This is called a \"**Broad Spectrum**\" sunscreen. It covers both UVA + UVB\n\n**4. Beginner-friendly Sunscreen checklist**\n\n* SPF 30 - 50\n* PA+++ or PA++++\n* Non-greasy or gel texture (great for humidity)\n* ^(1/2) **teaspoon** for face + neck\n* Reapply every **2 hours** if outdoors, sweating or wiping your face\n* Start simple, no need for expensive or complicated products\n* Check: What is the UV Index today? UV index ≥ 3; protect asap\n\n**5. Common questions picked up on Reddit (and safe solutions)**\n\n* **S**hiny, white cast / grey tone = Try chemical filters sunscreens, matte or tinted options\n* **U**nder humid weather, greasy/sweaty = Look for gel, water-based formulations\n* **N**ot sure, products expensive = Budget-friendly: Minimalist, Re'queil, Fixderma, Pharma\n* **S**till tanning = Use enough amount, choose SPF 50 **+** PA+++ or PA++++\n* **C**an't remember to apply = Use a UV Index free app, build a protection habit\n* **R**eally worried sunscreen causes Vit-D deficiency = It reduces burning, not all UV\n* **E**ver wonder about SPF 100 vs SPF 50 = Not double protection, difference is small\n* **E**ven indoors? = UVA can enter through windows &amp; cause pigmentation over-time\n* **N**ot sure what to pick = Prioritise comfort + protection. Stay NAFE safe.\n\n**Takeaway:** Sunscreen reduces UV damage &amp; long-term risks, it doesn’t block all tanning. Start small, apply correct amount, protect consistently and give your skin the chance to repair itself.\n\nBon SkinVoyage!\n\nSearch this community for my earlier post:  \n**Healthy Skin 101: Which SPF fact has surprised you the most in your skincare journey?**",

I’m a bit lost with my curly hair routine and would love some advice, especially for frizz management.\n\nI think I have 3B/3C curls (?) and maybe high porosity, but I’m not sure. The photos may help you tell me what you think about my curl type and porosity.\n\nI’m EU-based, so not every US product is easy to get, but I can order online if something is really worth it. Still, I’d love suggestions I can actually find here too.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n- Help understanding my porosity\n- A simple routine suggestion\n- Recommendations for a good leave-in and curl cream (priority!)\n- Any other product ideas that could help with dryness/frizz\n\nWhat I currently use:\n\nMielle Rosemary Mint (as a clarifying once every one to 2 weeks) + Aussie Miracle Moist shampoos, Aussie deep hydration conditioner, Lush Super Milk (Leave in spray), Garnier Banana Hair Food (kinda as a leave in/curl cream), ECO Gel, some oils (Amla, Castor), and Aussie heat protectant before diffusing.\n\nWhat I want to try next:\n\nThinking of buying the SheaMoisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Mask for deep hydration. If you’ve used it on hair like mine, please tell me if it’s worth it!\n\nMy main issues: very dry, frizzy, moisture-sucking curls that don’t hold definition well.\n\nThank you so much for any help 💛\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I’m not sure of my curl type and porosity and I need help building a routine. All good recommendations are welcome, especially for a leave-in and a curl cream. ",

The right side of my smile stretches more and looks looser, while the left side feels more stiff in comparison. I’ve also noticed that:\n\n- My right eye squints more when I smile\n- There is a bit more skin fold under my right eye than the left\n\nAt rest my face looks mostly fine, but when I smile, especially in back camera photos, my face starts to look  deformed or uneven, which somewhere affect my confidence.\n\nI just wanted to ask:\n\n- Has anyone else dealt with something like this?\n- Did it get better or worse over time?\n- Did anything help  exercises, habits, posture changes, dentist visit, physio, etc.?\n\nI don’t have any history of facial injury or surgery. I’m mainly looking for shared experiences and practical advice.\n\nThank you to anyone who takes the time to reply 🤍",

      "content": "Hi! Long time lurker, desperate for advice. I need to figure out a way to style my hair for work in a restaurant where I’m in a FOH, customer facing managerial role half the night, running outside in the parking lot half the night in the armpit of Hell we call Florida, and I help bartend, serve, and do some light kitchen work. \n\n\nProblems: \n\nMy restaurant is old and AC is mediocre so we have high powered fans everywhere in the back, about my head height.  I really do need to wash my hair nightly, as we have Parmesan flying everywhere, it’s sweaty, and you just leave smelling like food. I get off and am ready to shower around midnight, but I’m also exhausted and can’t be up for 5 hours waiting for my curls to dry correctly. Also not getting up at 8am to do anything to my hair. My curls are frizzy, I’ve had the “halo” my whole life, and as I’ve finally gotten all the dye grown out of my hair, I’ve been noticing a very distinct look resembling the Mayor of Whoville happening to me. (Not joking- stay tuned)\n\nRoutine \n\nI shower nightly if I work and I use L’Oreal glossing shampoo and conditioner and once or twice a week, the L’Oreal cleansing shampoo with the scalp scrubber. When I get out of the shower, I do like a peach pit size conditioner into mostly the ends of my hair, and then wrap it up with a microfiber towel to dry almost fully. After that, it’s the NYM curly girl cream, wide toothed brushing, and then the NYM curly girl mousse, light scrunch, and I’ll add some gel as it’s drying. If my hair starts to get crunchy, I’ll use some light argan oil, and I’ll use it on my hair in the morning if I’m trying to braid it. \n\nWhile I sleep, it really depends on how tired I am. I’ll either do super loose French braids or a loose bun in a silk scrunchie at the top of my head. \n\nMy current hairstyles consist of two French braids, a bun on basically the top of my head like Miss frizzle, or if I’m not working, I’ll pull it back on either side of my head in clips or in one clip to the back.  I feel like my hair looks ridiculous at work and I just cannot figure out how to manage my shower schedule with my hair looking acceptable for both FOH and being off my neck and face for kitchen help. \n\n",

Several months ago, I decided to upgrade my routine, and it completely dried out my face, and I can't figure out why. I used Instree moisturizer on my T-zone and the good light on my dry areas, and even switched the application zones, but I still got the same dryness. I wait the recommended time between product applications, and all are applied evenly and lightly to the skin. The niacinamide products are also only applied to my T-zone. I've tried pushing the routine for 2 weeks total to no avail. I can only report that the Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask did help moisturize my face after it got dried out from the routine. Any ideas on what's drying out my face and suggestions?\n\nThe routine is as follows:\n\n1. Toner, wait 2 min\n2. niacinamide, wait 1 min\n3. Snail mucin, wait until mostly non-sticky\n4. Vitamin C serum, wait until mostly dry\n5. moisturizer, wait 3 min",

I have fine, low-porosity curls that are extremely dry, and I live in a cold climate (not sure if that matters). No matter what I do, my hair never lasts more than a day, and even on wash day, I’m rarely happy with how it looks.\n\nI’ve tried everything, sleeping with a bonnet and silk pillowcase, Olaplex and K18 treatments, high-end styling products, different Denman/curly brushes, clarifying and hydrating shampoos, leave-ins, deep treatments, protein vs moisture experiments, oils, even splurging on a Dyson dryer and a steamer. I’ve done all the “right” things, but my hair still looks flat, dry, and undefined. It never feels healthy or shiny, and I honestly don’t even know my curl type anymore because it’s so lifeless.\n\nTo make it look halfway decent, I have to completely wet and restyle section by section every single day, I can’t just take off my bonnet and shake it out. I limit slick backs and avoid tension, but nothing changes. I’ve started wondering if this is just my hair and I need to accept it, but deep down, I’m not convinced. I want those gorgeous, bouncy, shiny curls everyone talks about, and I feel like something is missing.\nPics for reference:\n\nFirst photo is right after a wash day. The rest are day 2 onward/how my hair generally looks.\nIf anyone has tips, routines, or product suggestions that could help, please share, I’m desperate!\n\nROUTINE: \nFor wash day, I alternate between K18 shampoo and curl smith hydrating shampoo followed by K18 conditioner. For styling I layer Curlsmith Frizz Retainer Jelly Styler, Curlsmith Volume Mousse, and Innersense ‘I Create Hold’, then dry with my Dyson dryer.\n\n",

Then I saw a dermatologist who prescribed Acnelak face wash, Clindamycin gel, Bioderma Atoderm Crème, and sunscreen.\n\nRoutine:\nAM: Face wash → Moisturizer → Clindamycin → Sunscreen\nPM: Face wash → Moisturizer → Clindamycin\n\nEven after following this properly, I still get random flare-ups and persistent closed comedones. Nothing seems to stay clear, and sometimes it gets worse.\n\nI’m 25, live in Pune (not very humid), and have combination skin.\nCan anyone tell what these flare-ups might actually be or what I should adjust?\n\nThanks.",
