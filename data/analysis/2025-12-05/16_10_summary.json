      "content": "I’ve been using the Dot &amp; Key Vitamin C + SPF 50 sunscreen for a month straight. I bought it after seeing all the ads and I regretted it for a sec much since everyone bashed it but honestly, here is my hot take based just on my experience: \n\nPros: Leaves no white cast on my face. I layer it with a Serum, Moisturizer and then sunscreen but it hardly feels oily (maybe cuz I have dull skin). The texture feels good on the skin and mixes well. Feels very light. I hate the feeling of being plastered when I apply sunscreen so this felt good for a change.\n\nCons: Everyone keeps saying the SPF protection is not as good. I personally didn’t feel that way, since my face didn’t get any darker. It did give it a subtle suppleness, and i am getting no unwanted tan yet either. \n\nI think i’m gonna stick with it irrespective of what i might hear, if something works for you- it works! It is what it is. \n",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

A lot of people see a dude with a horseshoe and say \"Shave that already!\" and in some cases they might be right. But I’m starting to think the popularity of that advice has less to do with hair and more to do with how we dress now.  \n  \nIt used to be the case that if you were in your 30s during the 1950s and going bald, you were most likely already wearing a suit and dress shoes. Nowadays however you'd probably find yourself in a band tee and a pair of Nikes. It seems to me that this is what creates a weird visual mismatch — less “aging naturally” and more “overgrown man-child\", leading people to adopt the cue ball look to maintain some form of \"youthfulness\", if you could even call it that.  \n  \nDo you think the modern shaved-head trend is really about hair… or is it about the clash between baldness and casual, youthful looks?",

Still, I’d love suggestions I can actually find here too.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n- Help understanding my porosity\n- A simple routine suggestion\n- Recommendations for a good leave-in and curl cream (priority!)\n- Any other product ideas that could help with dryness/frizz\n\nWhat I currently use:\n\nMielle Rosemary Mint (as a clarifying once every one to 2 weeks) + Aussie Miracle Moist shampoos, Aussie deep hydration conditioner, Lush Super Milk (Leave in spray), Garnier Banana Hair Food (kinda as a leave in/curl cream), ECO Gel, some oils (Amla, Castor), and Aussie heat protectant before diffusing.\n\nWhat I want to try next:\n\nThinking of buying the SheaMoisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Mask for deep hydration. If you’ve used it on hair like mine, please tell me if it’s worth it!\n\nMy main issues: very dry, frizzy, moisture-sucking curls that don’t hold definition well.\n\nThank you so much for any help 💛\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I’m not sure of my curl type and porosity and I need help building a routine.

      "content": "**Most people buy sunscreen** by looking at SPF 50 or SPF 30; but SPF only tells part of the story. To truly protect your skin, especially in India, you need to understand **SPF + PA.**\n\n**1. SPF = Sun Protection Factor against UVB** **(\"Burn + Tanning\" rays)**\n\n* SPF measures rays filtering duration strength, not the duration you can stay in the sun\n* Simple rule **SPF 30-50** is ideal for daily Indian sun\n* SPF 30 filters \\~97% of UVB and SPF 50 filters \\~98%, diminishing returns\n* Think of SPF as an umbrella, higher SPF = fewer UVB rays slip through\n* Memory bank:  **B** in UV**B** = **B**urn\n\n**2. PA = Protection against UVA (\"Deep damage + Pigmentation\" rays)**\n\n* UVA rays penetrate deeper, they cause pigmentation, premature ageing &amp; long-term damage\n* **PA rating** tells you how much UVA protection your sunscreen gives:\n   * PA+ = some\n   * PA++ = moderate\n   * PA+++ = high\n   * PA++++ = very high\n* For Indian skin, choose **PA+++ or PA++++** to help prevent tanning &amp; pigmentation\n* Memory bank:  **A** in UV**A** = **A**geing\n\n**3. Why SPF + PA matter together**\n\n* SPF alone won't protect you from long-term UV damage (pigmentation, dark-spots)\n* Look for SPF 30 - 50 **with** PA+++ or PA++++\n* This is called a \"**Broad Spectrum**\" sunscreen. It covers both UVA + UVB\n\n**4. Beginner-friendly Sunscreen checklist**\n\n* SPF 30 - 50\n* PA+++ or PA++++\n* Non-greasy or gel texture (great for humidity)\n* ^(1/2) **teaspoon** for face + neck\n* Reapply every **2 hours** if outdoors, sweating or wiping your face\n* Start simple, no need for expensive or complicated products\n* Check: What is the UV Index today? UV index ≥ 3; protect asap\n\n**5. Common questions picked up on Reddit (and safe solutions)**\n\n* **S**hiny, white cast / grey tone = Try chemical filters sunscreens, matte or tinted options\n* **U**nder humid weather, greasy/sweaty = Look for gel, water-based formulations\n* **N**ot sure, products expensive = Budget-friendly: Minimalist, Re'queil, Fixderma, Pharma\n* **S**till tanning = Use enough amount, choose SPF 50 **+** PA+++ or PA++++\n* **C**an't remember to apply = Use a UV Index free app, build a protection habit\n* **R**eally worried sunscreen causes Vit-D deficiency = It reduces burning, not all UV\n* **E**ver wonder about SPF 100 vs SPF 50 = Not double protection, difference is small\n* **E**ven indoors? = UVA can enter through windows &amp; cause pigmentation over-time\n* **N**ot sure what to pick = Prioritise comfort + protection. Stay NAFE safe.\n\n**Takeaway:** Sunscreen reduces UV damage &amp; long-term risks, it doesn’t block all tanning. Start small, apply correct amount, protect consistently and give your skin the chance to repair itself.\n\nBon SkinVoyage!\n\nSearch this community for my earlier post:  \n**Healthy Skin 101: Which SPF fact has surprised you the most in your skincare journey?**",

It could be ingrown hairs, razor bumps, shaving irritation, pigmentation, or marks left from old acne. The area feels like it has a lot of tiny clogged pores or trapped hair roots. I want to understand what this condition actually is so I can fix it properly. If anyone has had something similar or knows what this might be, please tell me.

      "content": "I’ve been thinking a lot about my own skin journey after my last post, and I kinda realised I never actually said this out loud before.\n\nFor the longest time I thought my acne was a “me problem.” Like I wasn’t washing enough. Or not disciplined enough. Or just unlucky with genetics and had to accept it.\n\nI’ve tried everything since I was around 12–13. Every routine. Every cleanser. I took every suggestion I got. As you can tell from the photos I got a little too much skincare😅 Antibiotics, facials, tret, laser… and eventually accutane. (4th pic is my scalp after accutane.) And when the acne came back a few months after accutane… it honestly broke me. I felt so ashamed and exhausted. It’s weird how much acne changes the way you move through life without you realising it. That’s what pushed me into full-on “I need to understand this” mode.\n\nI remember waking up and the first thing I’d do was check the mirror and think “great… today is gonna suck.” I said “no” to parties, hangouts, dates, not because I didn’t want to go, but because I couldn’t get myself to show up with a huge breakout on my face. I felt like people looked at my acne before they looked at me.\n\nIt sounds dramatic written out, but that was my reality for years. And I know a lot of people here feel the same — the constant checking, hiding your face in certain lighting, avoiding eye contact, overthinking everything. Acne takes over your brain in a way that skincare guides never really talk about.\n\nWhat I wish someone told me earlier is this: Your skin isn’t trying to ruin your life. Sometimes it’s just reacting to things you don’t even realise.\n\nFor me, the big turning point wasn’t a new product. It was when I started supporting my gut and calming things down inside. My digestion was a mess for years, and once that improved, my skin slowly followed. Not overnight. Not perfectly. But it got calmer. And honestly the biggest relief wasn’t even the clear skin — it was waking up without dread, feeling like I didn’t have to avoid mirrors anymore, and slowly getting some confidence back.\n\nHere’s what I do now in case it helps anyone\n\nAM: I actually don’t wash my face in the morning anymore. I just use a light ampoule, moisturiser, and SPF. Nothing fancy. PM: Mild cleanser, the same ampoule, moisturiser, and sometimes a bit of the Avene acne scars gel on the leftover marks. Daily habits that helped me: way more water, fixing my digestion, adding a mix of fibers including probiotics and prebiotic(I made my own mix because nothing I tried really worked for me), sleeping better, and eating in a way that keeps my stomach calm. Skin type: oily around the mouth/jaw, used to be super inflamed, now a lot calmer.\n\nI’m not saying everyone’s acne comes from the same thing. It’s different for each person. But I wanted to share this because I genuinely spent years thinking I was broken or doing something wrong.\n\nIf anyone wants me to talk about what helped internally, what didn’t help at all, or anything else you’re curious about, I’m happy to share. Acne feels lonely, but you’re really not alone in it.",

I’ve been trying to focus on my curls for the last 5 months it seems and it’s definitely gotten better, but this is a stage I’m stuck in now where it’s curly but also oddly thin? I’m very new at this so I’m not even sure what type of hair I have in terms of curl pattern. Is there a different haircut that I could maybe try? I feel a little meh about the whole thinning/thin thing because my hair i hold very near and dear to my heart. I included photos of my hair in 2023 because I feel like it was much thicker then. I did not use any products at the time nor was I focused on hair care like that sadly. \n\nI was overexercising for a hot second there (about 3-4 months) without proper nutrition which is when I noticed a ton of shedding/loss. I’ve been eating normally and back on track for about 7 months now. I put my routine below in order of how I do it! The photos I have here I blow dried with an adapter because of the cold weather,  which I don’t typically do. I usually let it air dry after I put the products in.

The right side of my smile stretches more and looks looser, while the left side feels more stiff in comparison. I’ve also noticed that:\n\n- My right eye squints more when I smile\n- There is a bit more skin fold under my right eye than the left\n\nAt rest my face looks mostly fine, but when I smile, especially in back camera photos, my face starts to look  deformed or uneven, which somewhere affect my confidence.\n\nI just wanted to ask:\n\n- Has anyone else dealt with something like this?\n- Did it get better or worse over time?\n- Did anything help  exercises, habits, posture changes, dentist visit, physio, etc.?\n\nI don’t have any history of facial injury or surgery. I’m mainly looking for shared experiences and practical advice.\n\nThank you to anyone who takes the time to reply 🤍",

      "content": "I tried fin for about a year and unfortunately it's not for me. I have decided I won't be ever using it again. \n\nI've been off fin for about 7 months and during that time i thought i was basically out of options and have pretty much just been trying to enjoy the time i have with the hair I have left while mentally preparing for shaving. \n\nAll the recent talk of PP405 and Breezula etc got me a bit excited and i realised that while we have no idea whether something promising will come out soon, it could actually be really beneficial for me to try and hold on as best i can for a couple of years. \n\nThe past few days i've been looking into drugs like Breezula which lead me into looking at RU58841 which lead me to look at other topical anti androgens on the market. \n\nFluridil seems like a really promising option that i could look into. I'm not even suggesting that it needs to be a replacement for fin, but since fin isn't an option to me, it looks like something definitely worth trying. \n\nHow come meds like this aren't talked about more? Do you think it's worth trying? it sounds like the safety profile is really good, even if the effects aren't super strong. The only negative is the price. I'm in the UK and it looks like i'll have to buy it from Germany and it works out to about £55 for a months supply. \n\nJust wanted to know your thoughts on if it's worth it, whether you've used it before, any tips, advice on where to get it, how to apply it etc. \n\nCheers!\n\n",

The short question: Do you have any experience with mineral makeup and is it actually worth investing?\n\nBackground: I'm trying to rebuild my skincare routine &amp; I have everything covered now, except for makeup. I have very oily skin, but also very sensitive and red, and rosacea.\n\nI love makeup, but I'm only wearing it on the weekend. I only wear powder-foundation, so no liquids. Currently I'm using drug store stuff for like 6€. I checked our local makeup store and the section for mineral makeup is quite pricey, powder foundation is like 45€ there. I'm not sure if I should invest, or if it doesn't really make a difference :)",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
