This is my first post and I want to say \"hey\" and thank everyone for making this such a great curlmunity🎉🫶!!  \n\nA while back someone on this thread recommended Boulceme Curl Cream. I decided to go for it (REALLY go for it - I bought the 1L size!!!) Luckily it works great with my hair (which has interesting curl patterns and textures due to being varying shades of gray and white). Thanks, curl community!🙌\n\nNote: if you are confused by what my hair style is, I am, too 😅. I've been cutting it myself for years and I guess I would call it an asymmetrical bob (???)\n\nHere is my (very basic) routine:\n-Shampoo and condition with Not Your Mother's Curl Talk.\n-Comb with wide tooth comb\n-Apply Boulceme Curl Cream to lightly towel-dried hair\n-Air dry\n\n ",

I tried last winter but then chickened out and got highlights again 9 a bit over a month after going a bit darker. I’ve had blonde highlights since I was 16 so this is all I’ve known for so long.

I asked for bangs the same as usual (and they didn’t come out quite how I like them but they aren’t my main concern) and I asks for weight to be removed from the rest of my hair and shorter layers, a little shaggy but too much.\n\nI’ve washed and tried letting it air dry like usual over the past week and it just looks and feels off. I asked for other opinions and they think I’m crazy. I feel like it’s mushrooming/triangle shaped on top and it’s too bulky and long on the right side and it isn’t shaped right for my natural texture. I wish I had a picture of how she did it last time, it had a slight shag vibe without being too much for me. The right side isn’t usually this straight looking on top and I can’t get it to hold a curl now. \n\nAm I going crazy? Would it be rude to ask if I could come back in to try and fix it some? I feel like the top layer is too long and not blended in well. It is widening my lower face instead of drawling eyes up.\n\nThoughts? Opinions?? How do I explain what isn’t sitting right for me?\n\nLast photo is what I should maybe show for inspo? I have very thick hair that is curlier at roots and on bottom layers so I know it can’t look quite like hers. ",

I really want to take care of my underarms. \n\nBackground:\n\n\t•\tI used razors only for several years (stopped \\~2 years ago)\n\n\t•\tAround a year ago, I had a wax burn from Rica wax\n\n\t•\tSince then, I switched to hard Brazilian wax, but I feel my underarm skin keeps getting worse\n\n\t•\tI have thick, coarse hair\n\n\t•\tMy skin is PIH-prone — even mosquito bites leave dark marks for months before fading\n\n\t•\tCurrently using Chemist at Play underarm roll-on\n\n\t•\tOccasionally used alum for odor\n\n\t•\tRarely used The Ordinary Glycolic Acid with a cotton pad\n\n\t•\tRecently exfoliated gently with Dove body polish (pink variant)\n\nCurrent issues:\n\n\t•\tPersistent dark pigmentation\n\n\t•\tUneven tone\n\n\t•\tBumps after waxing (they go away, but darkness doesn’t)\n\n\t•\tSkin gets irritated easily after hair removal\n\nWhat I’m confused about:\n\n\t•\tIs epilator better or worse than hard/Brazilian wax for someone like me?\n\n\t•\tShould I completely avoid root hair removal?\n\n\t•\tWould switching to a trimmer actually help pigmentation fade?\n\n\t•\tAny routines/products that helped you personally?\n\nLaser is not an option for me right now, so I’m looking for realistic, affordable solutions.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar underarm pigmentation or sensitive skin, I’d really appreciate your experience or advice 🙏\n\nPlease be kind — this is something I’m genuinely trying to fix.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "\n\nI’m in the process of growing out old dyed hair (from a year ago and i used permanent dye) now a good amount is virgin, but what’s left of the lighter/warmer part annoys me every time I look at it. I don’t want to commit to permanent dye because my goal is still to fully grow it out, but I’m debating whether it’s worth using semi-permanent or demi-permanent dye just on the ends to blend it better or if I should just leave it alone. The issue is that I wash my hair every day (very oily scalp), so I’m worried semi-permanent will wash out super fast and be a waste of money or demi-permanent will last longer but might dry out or damage my already-dyed ends. \n\nHas anyone been in this situation?\nWould you recommend:\n• semi-permanent (diluted / ends only)?\n\n• demi-permanent (short processing, ends only)?\n\n• or just leaving the color alone and dealing with it until it grows out?\n\nI’m really torn because I want it to look more even, but I also don’t want to make my ends worse or spend money on something that’ll be gone in a week. Also i’ve tried using the loreal le colour gloss in cool brunette and i didn’t like it. \n\nMy current routine: \n\n• I use pre wash oils before each wash i alternate around with jojoba, coconut and indian brand vatika oils. \n\n• Dove cucumber moisture shampoo (h&amp;s tea tree 1x week for scalp health) \n\n• Pantene miracle rescue deep conditoner (Dove intensive repair mask with h&amp;s) \n\n• Tresemme lameller gloss cream serum + Loreal extraordinary oil \n\nAny advice or personal experiences would help a lot 🙏",

I get occasional breakouts. My skin will be clear for at most a week. And then 2-3 weeks of non stop acne, Which then takes another 2 or 3 weeks to fully heal. I’ve tried everything from antibiotics and Tret and differin to eliminating things from my diet. Differin helps quite a a bit and so does eating a mostly whole food diet (no dairy and no pretty much no sugar). But as soon as I eat something processed or with sugar I see my skin breakout in less than 3 days. My acne really isn’t that bad anymore but it is still bothersome. I do modeling for work and having these occasional breakouts really messes up with shoots and castings I have to go to. I’m on adapalene 0.3% and have been for the last 12 months, results are decent nothing life changing, my derm has me on doxycycline whenever I experience breakouts he just tells me to take as needed (50mg dose usually for 3 months at a time) he’s also given me the option to do accutane since he knows the importance of me having clear skin for my job. I have been hesitant to take it so I’m on here looking for some opinions",

For about 10 years it was straight not pin straight but if I got out of the shower and brushed it would dry straight. So my haircut is still coming off being cut for straight hair. Lots of razoring in there. Well perimenopause has decided to remodel and the curls are BACK! 🤗 Buuut… products and procedures have changed a lot in 10 years. I need help with finding a gel that doesn’t flake when I break the cast. I love the way Paul Mitchell’s Super Clean Sculpting Gel forms my curls. It controls frizz and gives me volume but it’s so flaky. The curl creams I’ve tried just make my hair a frizzy mess even when paired with gel. I’ve tried NYM spray gel and it doesn’t have enough hold for my hair. \n\nRoutine:\n\nShampoo and conditioner: Pacifica Scalp Love\n\n1st Mousse: NYM Curl Talk \n\n2nd Gel: Paul Mitchell Super Clean Sculpting \n\nI break the cast with Kristin Ess Air Dry Crème (I ONLY use this once my hair is dry). \n\nI occasionally use aerosol hair spray at the roots. \n\nI have a pixie cut and my hair doesn’t tangle easily so I don’t brush it often but when I do it’s between applying conditioner and rinsing it. Brush recommendations appreciated as well. \n\nTYSM",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I’ve already undergone Dermapen (microneedling), laser treatments, and chemical peels, but my scars are still visible.\n\nI also have uneven texture on my forehead, which makes my skin look rough and bumpy, especially in certain lighting.\n\nI wanted to ask what actually worked for you in treating deep acne scars and uneven skin texture? Are there any advanced treatments, skincare routines, or lifestyle changes that genuinely made a difference?\n\nAny advice, personal experiences, or dermatologist-recommended options would be really appreciated.

Considering a switch to dut to optimize regrowth. \n\nMy goal was to see if I could salvage my hair for a transplant density that I would be happy with. \n\nIt also hard for me to be objective with progress, but it does seem I have gained some ground in the last year. Not as much as I would have liked but the bar on here is very high!\n\nIt also seems like there are still a significant number of hairs that don't quite seem to be terminal but weren't noticible a year ago either. Not sure if I should expect them to continue growing and see more progress or not.\n\n  \nWhat does everything think about this progress, should I expect more growth? Should I go for a transplant now or wait?",
