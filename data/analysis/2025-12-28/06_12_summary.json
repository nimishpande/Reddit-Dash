      "content": "I got my first ever curly cut march this year and I absolutely loved it. My curls were healthy and I loved the shape. The curls in the first photo is from September this year so about 3 months ago, and the second photo I took at the beginning of this month. I’m extremely upset with the way my curls have been looking. I know that the longer your hair gets, the more the curl pattern stretches out. However, I don’t understand how so much can change in such little time. In the second photo the shape is off and my curls are really..thin? I’m not sure how to describe it. I’m noticing some pieces start really thick and then towards the bottom it really thins out. I’m not sure if this is breakage? I haven’t really done anything different so I don’t understand why this could be happening. I shampoo and condition once a week, I sleep with a silk bonnet, I detangle my hair with a detangling brush and lots of conditioner, I don’t use any heat besides diffusing, ect. I have always had the same routine and it has always worked for me. I just don’t understand why suddenly my hair appears so damaged. After my curly cut I wasn’t getting regular trims because my hair seemed to be growing healthy and I didn’t feel the need so I don’t know if that could be the reason? Now I’m thinking about doing a big chop but I’m not sure if there are anyways I can save my curls?",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

While I do miss my curls, I’m trying to embrace my looser pattern (around 2B/2C), and honestly I kind of like them.\n\nMy main issue right now is frizz/poofiness. When my hair was curlier, it was easier to accept frizz because the curls were more noticeable, but at its current state its much \"poofier\" and simply looks uncared for by Day 3..\n\nIs there anything I can do to make it look shinier and clumpier? I’ve been looking into products with a laminating effect, but I’m not sure how healthy that is long term. Has anyone tried hair gloss?

I don't know what to do to make it better. I've looked up makeup plots and how to make facial features look more masculine, but it always turns out I'm looking like drag or barely noticeable.\n\nIn the first picture is my most recent attempt using a contour/concealer stick (palladio cinnamon) where I feel it's too soft/not very noticable. The next set is me using eyeshadow (LA colors cool) The final set I feel looks good, it was done by a drag king though a few years ago, and I've been trying to replicate it.\n\nSo anyone have any tips or suggestions so it doesn't look like drag but isn't light enough so it's not noticable?

      "content": "Hello!\n\nThis is my first time posting, so please forgive me if I forget any details. I'm trying to start taking better care of my hair because I want to let it grow for next year. I've been lurking on this reddit for a while and checking the guides, so here it goes.\n\nMy hair is dark and dense (I think), and based on what I've seen, I think it is type 3. My porosity is low. I uploaded some pictures from today with no products on. I was trying to figure out what type it is.\n\nI've been using Cantu Products for, like, two years because I used to never let it grow, but I've been liking the curls. Here's my routine: I wash my hair every week with Cantu Sulfate-Free Cleansing Cream Shampoo and Hydrating Cream Conditioner. I detangle with a wet brush and then apply Leave-In Conditioning Cream and Moisturizing Curl Activator Cream. During the week I apply Wave Whip Curling Mousse or a little bit of the Activator Cream. For styling, all I do is rake my hair with my fingers then shake my head and hope for the best. I tried finger coiling but it was a mess hahaha\n\nSo long story short, I guess I just want to confirm what type of hair I actually have and what products would work best for me and how to take care of it because now I live in RI and it's winter, and I don't know if that can have severe impacts on it too.\n\nThank you in advance for reading my post and offering guidance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c2c5217lv9g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85a7092b72c10666451e8dc2ec1ccc975d6afbdc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k2jltf17lv9g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=544e5406a58f8b8fb3d0daae3cf91ff78b3318c0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dcapo217lv9g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5ddabffcf8f1e380dbee50d145cd242125a1211\n\n",

I have clogged, combination skin and live in a very humid environment. For the last year I've been using the softymo and senka cleansers for my routine but I feel like it never did anything for my skin. I wear light makeup on most days and I feel if I don't double cleanse I won't get any make-up off. I don't want to use anymore oil cleanser as it's giving me a stye when I use around my eye make-up and I recently got a lash lift which won't hold long if I use oil cleanser. \n\nCurrently my routine is:\n\nEveryday AM: cleanser, toner, vitamin C, moisturizer, sunscreen.\n\nPM routine: oil cleanser, cleanser, toner, vitamin C, moisturizer.\n\nPM routine (3x a week): oil cleanser, cleanser, glycolic acid cream. \n\nThanks in advance.

The other one that was used by the brand natural look x-ten this always left glue and it got to a point I could hear it sizzle when i straightened my hair which is why I started removing them myself with the Zala one. Does anyone have recommendations similar to Zala I’ve only looked at c22 citrus solvent and big kizzy tape remover as they had similar ingredients to zalas which were Hydrocarbons: The primary dissolving agent.\n\n• Limonene: A main component in citrus oil that aids in breaking down adhesive bonds.\n\n• Natural Plant/Citrus Oils: Such as orange oil, which provide a fresh scent and help nourish the hair during the process.• Lanolin. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with those ??",
