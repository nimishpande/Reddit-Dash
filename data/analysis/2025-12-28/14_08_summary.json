      "content": "I got my first ever curly cut march this year and I absolutely loved it. My curls were healthy and I loved the shape. The curls in the first photo is from September this year so about 3 months ago, and the second photo I took at the beginning of this month. I’m extremely upset with the way my curls have been looking. I know that the longer your hair gets, the more the curl pattern stretches out. However, I don’t understand how so much can change in such little time. In the second photo the shape is off and my curls are really..thin? I’m not sure how to describe it. I’m noticing some pieces start really thick and then towards the bottom it really thins out. I’m not sure if this is breakage? I haven’t really done anything different so I don’t understand why this could be happening. I shampoo and condition once a week, I sleep with a silk bonnet, I detangle my hair with a detangling brush and lots of conditioner, I don’t use any heat besides diffusing, ect. I have always had the same routine and it has always worked for me. I just don’t understand why suddenly my hair appears so damaged. After my curly cut I wasn’t getting regular trims because my hair seemed to be growing healthy and I didn’t feel the need so I don’t know if that could be the reason? Now I’m thinking about doing a big chop but I’m not sure if there are anyways I can save my curls?",

Over the past months I’ve developed a cheesy smell in certain areas: behind my ears, scalp, corners of my nose, and sometimes even my earwax. It’s only noticeable when rubbed and fades quickly. There was also a time when my belly button became extremely itchy and smelled cheesy for days. This all began after a depressive period where I sometimes went days without showering. I’m now back to showering daily, but if I miss even 1-2 days, the smell returns. I never experienced this before, even in the past when I skipped showers.\n\nI’m trying to understand how to reset my skin/body back to normal. This has been making me really anxious because I hate the thought of smelling bad or being perceived as unhygienic.\n\nMy current routine\nFace: Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser, Aveeno Oat Gel Moisturizer, Adapalene 0.1%. Body: Dove Sensitive soap and Aveeno Daily Moisturizer. I’m looking for long-term solutions that restore balance, not just temporary fixes.\n\nEDIT: I really appreciate all the suggestions. Most people suspect it’s a yeast overgrowth, so I’m going to set up an appointment with a dermatologist to be sure and get proper guidance.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

Run a little Cantu Cream Pomade and then a tiny drop of grapeseed oil through my hair brushingit backwards. Scrunch a little then dry with diffuser. When almost dry gently style with fingers if required.\nI wash hair every 3-4 days with a cgm friendly shampoo and dry with a t-shirt. Use Jesdicurl deep conditioner about once a month or when required.\n\n(Day 4) - I simply spray a tiny amount of water onto my hair then just 3 to 4 sprays of Clean Curls refresher spray, push hair backwards and Scrunch a little then quickly dry with diffuser.

I'm interested in keeping it long enough to curl, at least. But my personal issue is that I have a narrow, very straight edged face. The sides of my hair grow straight out and curl stronger than anywhere else on my head, I hate it. I also have mixed pattern. I just feel like I look like a clown all the time. When my hair was really short, I looked good with short sides. But the second I grow it out the sides grow anti-gravity and it creates this strange shape. What should be goals be? I have fine hair so my hair also doesn't hold it's curl well, and I never mastered using gel. All product seems to weight it down.\n\n\nAny thoughts at all would be appreciated.\n\n\nRoutine: inconsistent. Wash every couple days with either heard water shampoo (ION) or regular generic moisturizing shampoo (any brand). Condition any brand. Nothing added after shower usually. Air drying makes the best curls but I have to wear a hat like half the year which crushes them flat. Blow dry with diffuser in the winter. ",

(Louder for the ones in the back) but barrier + hydration support.\n\nIngredients that help:\n\nHyaluronic Acid → hydrates, reduces tightness\n\nColloidal Oatmeal → beta-glucans soothe inflammation\n\nGotu Kola (Centella) → strengthens repair + reduces heat (my personal favourite!!)\n\nSqualane → replenishes lipids + restores flexibility\n\nIf your skin flares up easily but also calms down with gentle care → you have reactive skin, not sensitive skin.\n\nHope this helps someone who’s been confused by their skin’s behaviour!\n\n(Not medical advice,  just sharing what I see often in my practice)",

      "content": "Hi! \n\nI have been dealing with some skin problems for a while now. At the end of 2023, I started getting acne for the first time (mainly on the chin/jaw, also on cheeks). It improved for a short while but has recently returned. For context, I'm 25 years old - so getting acne for the first time at 23-25 years old is pretty devastating. The spot on my chin in the images has re-flared up multiple times and I can't seem to get rid of it. I know acne in this area is linked to hormones but it happens all month, not at specific points in the cycle. \n\nMy other issue besides acne is that my skin just looks dull and lifeless. I have some dark under eye circles (you can see the darker pigmentation in the pics), and I just have no glow. \n\nI have cut back a lot on my skincare due to the acne. For reference, I think I have combination skin as it can be oily around my nose and chin, but I also get dry patches occasionally.\n\nIn the morning, I just wash my face with water, put on Byoma Moisturising Gel Cream and the Skin 1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum. \n\nIn the evening, my routine varies. I always use the Skin 1004 Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil, Shiseido Senka Perfect Whip Cleansing Foam and Byoma Moisturising Gel Cream. Once a week before moisturising, I use The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulsion. I also use the Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum with Ginseng and Retinal a few times a week. Occasionally, I'll use the Medicube Zero Pore Pads, or the COSRX Snail Mucin Power Essence. I use pimple patches on my spots too.\n\nIs there anything I can add/remove from my routine to improve my skin? Especially removing the acne and the red marks that they leave. Nothing seems to be improving which has been getting me down. ",

I’ve tried different products and different facials and absolutely nothing has helped. After a facial my skin will feel soft for about 5 hours, then the dry comes back. The same with new products. I heard it might be being caused by the mirena coil, so I had that taken out almost 2 weeks ago but that hasn’t changed it. I also bought a water filter for my shower but that hasn’t made a difference either. I try not to wash my face too often and have only been using a small amount of Vaseline on my face once a day, I feel like it just sits on top rather than moisturises it though. I drink a lot of filtered water, no alcohol, no caffeine, minimal sugar and minimal processed food. I’m coeliac so I do not eat gluten either, not sure if that’s relevant or not but just want to give you all the details. The skin on my body is really soft and seems to be naturally moisturised, I only use a natural soap on it, nothing else. This problem is only on my face. Just wondering if anyone has any advice please? Thank you! 🙏",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m really hoping for some advice because I’m feeling pretty stressed about my hair.\n\nI recently got sewn-in extensions, and before the appointment I specifically warned my stylist that I have a butterfly haircut. I asked her directly if extensions would still work and blend well with that cut, and she assured me it would be fine.\n\nWhen I left the salon, I initially thought it looked okay, but once I washed and styled my hair myself, I realized the top layer is WAY too visible. It honestly looks ridiculous — you can clearly see where my natural hair ends and where the extensions start.\n\nI have a lot of natural hair, and it tends to puff up, get frizzy, and gain volume very easily. Because of that, it literally looks like I have my real hair on top and then two thin strips of hair hanging underneath from the extensions. There’s no blending at all.\n\nAnother issue is color. My natural hair has reddish/orange undertones, and while I do have blonde highlights, the extensions are more brown with blonde, and something about it just looks off and mismatched in real life.\n\nI already booked another appointment to add more hair, because that’s the only solution I could think of, but now I’m not even sure if adding more extensions will actually fix the problem — or if the cut itself is the real issue.\n\nHas anyone dealt with extensions not blending because of a butterfly cut or very short top layers?\nWould adding more hair help, or does this need a recut / different placement / different color match?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated. I’m feeling super frustrated and disappointed.",
