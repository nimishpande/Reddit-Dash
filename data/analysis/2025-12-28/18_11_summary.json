I really want to take care of my underarms. \n\nBackground:\n\n\t•\tI used razors only for several years (stopped \\~2 years ago)\n\n\t•\tAround a year ago, I had a wax burn from Rica wax\n\n\t•\tSince then, I switched to hard Brazilian wax, but I feel my underarm skin keeps getting worse\n\n\t•\tI have thick, coarse hair\n\n\t•\tMy skin is PIH-prone — even mosquito bites leave dark marks for months before fading\n\n\t•\tCurrently using Chemist at Play underarm roll-on\n\n\t•\tOccasionally used alum for odor\n\n\t•\tRarely used The Ordinary Glycolic Acid with a cotton pad\n\n\t•\tRecently exfoliated gently with Dove body polish (pink variant)\n\nCurrent issues:\n\n\t•\tPersistent dark pigmentation\n\n\t•\tUneven tone\n\n\t•\tBumps after waxing (they go away, but darkness doesn’t)\n\n\t•\tSkin gets irritated easily after hair removal\n\nWhat I’m confused about:\n\n\t•\tIs epilator better or worse than hard/Brazilian wax for someone like me?\n\n\t•\tShould I completely avoid root hair removal?\n\n\t•\tWould switching to a trimmer actually help pigmentation fade?\n\n\t•\tAny routines/products that helped you personally?\n\nLaser is not an option for me right now, so I’m looking for realistic, affordable solutions.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar underarm pigmentation or sensitive skin, I’d really appreciate your experience or advice 🙏\n\nPlease be kind — this is something I’m genuinely trying to fix.",

I can only watch my hair go away and get bald. \n\nI refuse to beliehe thaz. I get loads of insta ads where people try to sell me some oils which are like 70€ but I know that this is most likely some bullshit. \n\nI have heard that Rosmarine oil can make yokr hair fuller, healthier and help against hair loss. \n\nPeople always tell me my hair look like I just woke up even tho it took me 20 mins to style it. \n\nDo you guys have any advice, any real advice (preferably with some real experience) on how to improve my hair growth, thickness and cleanliness? \n\nThsvk you!

(Louder for the ones in the back) but barrier + hydration support.\n\nIngredients that help:\n\nHyaluronic Acid → hydrates, reduces tightness\n\nColloidal Oatmeal → beta-glucans soothe inflammation\n\nGotu Kola (Centella) → strengthens repair + reduces heat (my personal favourite!!)\n\nSqualane → replenishes lipids + restores flexibility\n\nIf your skin flares up easily but also calms down with gentle care → you have reactive skin, not sensitive skin.\n\nHope this helps someone who’s been confused by their skin’s behaviour!\n\n(Not medical advice,  just sharing what I see often in my practice)",

I'm interested in keeping it long enough to curl, at least. But my personal issue is that I have a narrow, very straight edged face. The sides of my hair grow straight out and curl stronger than anywhere else on my head, I hate it. I also have mixed pattern. I just feel like I look like a clown all the time. When my hair was really short, I looked good with short sides. But the second I grow it out the sides grow anti-gravity and it creates this strange shape. What should be goals be? I have fine hair so my hair also doesn't hold it's curl well, and I never mastered using gel. All product seems to weight it down.\n\n\nAny thoughts at all would be appreciated.\n\n\nRoutine: inconsistent. Wash every couple days with either heard water shampoo (ION) or regular generic moisturizing shampoo (any brand). Condition any brand. Nothing added after shower usually. Air drying makes the best curls but I have to wear a hat like half the year which crushes them flat. Blow dry with diffuser in the winter. ",

Wash with Difeel rosemary shampoo and conditioner every day.\n2. Before blowdrying it, I use a Kerastase hair oil (Elixir Ultime) on the ends and try to apply it up until the middle section of my hair, but not the roots.\n3. Blowdry it with medium heat.\n4. Apply a heat protection spray.\n5. Then iron it.\n\nI do this every day. My hair is quite burnt up and dry, but if I don't do this it looks awful.😭 What should I do, could you suggest a routine? Also, if I cut the end, how much should I cut of it?\n\nI dried it with a blowdrier in these photos.\n\nThank you if you can help!🙏🏻 (Excuse my English, it's not my first language.)\n\n",

I’ve already undergone Dermapen (microneedling), laser treatments, and chemical peels, but my scars are still visible.\n\nI also have uneven texture on my forehead, which makes my skin look rough and bumpy, especially in certain lighting.\n\nI wanted to askwhat actually worked for you in treating deep acne scars and uneven skin texture? Are there any advanced treatments, skincare routines, or lifestyle changes that genuinely made a difference?\n\nAny advice, personal experiences, or dermatologist-recommended options would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
