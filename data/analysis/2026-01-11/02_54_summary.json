No silicony texture which I miss. Cant say anything about sun protection as there was no prolonged exposure or harsh Sun in December. ",

I know that doesn’t make sense but every time I try, it’s a flop. I do it bottom, middle, top or atleast try to. Do you guys do the same or do u do front middle back (in terms of sections).Also how do you do it so the already product-ed hair sections don’t get in the way? I try to move it to the back but even with long hair it gets in the way and falls back. I swear every time I try and put it in a pony tail, it gets a ponytail dent and kind of clumps together. I hope this makes sense and I’m open to anything!\n\nHere’s my routine:\n1)detangle in the shower with ouidad curl quencher\n2)put in pattern moisture milk \nAnd not your mothers mousse\n3)use a curl comb (the one with ridges on the side)\nThat’s it (if you have suggestions please leave them!

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

My eyelids easily develop dry patches during the winter and I have to be very careful with my skin or I will develop dry patches on my neck. Since then, I've been avoiding moisturizers with active ingredients, harsh facial cleansers, and limit showering with very hot water. I've tried to use Aquaphor and Vaseline for relief but find that it actually causes a burning sensation when I put it on, and do not give me the moisturizing effect that I'm looking for. I've also tried the CeraVe line that is created specifically for eczematous skin but with no success. I'm at my last straw and need help. I cannot afford to go to the Dermatologist and scared to try any steroid products. Do you have any products you recommend?\n\nThank you and I'd love any advice!",

I’ve bought the ordinary glycolic acid to give it a try but I’ve heard it best to pair exfoliants with some type of moisturizer, which I have no clue what to search for or what products help brighten skin. Though, I have heard about Alpha Arbutin, but I’m not sure if it’s actually good or what strength to get.\n\nTL;DR : I would love to hear recommendations such as serums, toners, lotions, or body washes for (kinda??) severe body hyperpigmentation and scarring.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I have very straight hair and never had to deal with detangling so I’m a bit lost.\n\nWe wash her hair once or twice a week with a kids shampoo for curly hair (Johnson’s Kids) and then use A LOT of conditioner and a tangle teaser to detangle. It’s quite unpleasant for her and it takes up to 30/45 minutes to do so.\n\nWe tried other dry hair detangler sprays but they just feel like scented water to be fair.\n\nDo you have any advice on a routine? Any product advice that would be suitable for a young child? Any help would be appreciated.",

I really want to smell like a warm, elegant, orange-vanilla mocktail. However, I’ve run into a dilemma. I don’t have a budget, and I’ve been looking into higher-end products, but none of them seem to have good vanilla body washes that don’t have a million other scent in them that I don’t want. And when I look at cheaper options, they’re always sugary vanilla instead of warm/spicy vanilla. I don’t wanna smell like a sugar cookie! I hate sugar! I guess finding orange products is a little easier, but I still need recommendations. I can’t find any higher-end products with good orangey-citrus scents. Also, what types of things do I need to complete my routine? So far, I’ve only been searching for washes, oils, perfumes, and lotions. But is there anything else? The photos I’ve included are just there to provide a visual for the VIBE I’m going for, by the way. Other scents I enjoy include jasmine, lavender (slightly), and sometimes florals.",

Been doing everything I can: deep conditioning every week, consistent trims, a gentle shampoo + conditionner + leave-in that finally seems to work. I have even done some hot oil treatments, professional mask with essential oils, cornrows as protective styles, now finger coiling (because i have not had definition otherwise) over 6 years now. \n\nNow, I have seen SOME progress. But my hair has been consitently dim, stringy, dry to the touch, hard to get my fingers through, and has really bad breakage at the front and crown of my head. I also struggle with definition most times.\n\nFor context, i had an active lifestyle: i did kickboxing, and i like to go out whenever i need to on short notices. And I chose to go natural for one reason - to get healthier hair. \n\nNow, i need 5 hours​​ to style my hair, lasts me all week - BUT when i workout (no,  pineapples do not help) my hair becomes a sticky frizzy mess. It feels like weekly torture, because through it all I walk with unhealthy hair and cramped limbs... \n\nProfessionals, even the curly natural ones, have failed my hair, they always say it is heat/chemical damage, but i have not been using heat at all and have not used done relaxers since 6 years. They reccommend treatments that broke my bank, but have not changed my hair at all (but 2$ DIY treatments helped???)\n\nDoubts and stress have been getting to me and am about to consider protein treatment/keratin/silk presses - at least I can stop worrying about styling. But I am SO scared of going through damaged hair rehab AGAIN. \n\nWhat would you suggest? Thank you so much for reading through this.​\n\nMy current routine:  \n\n1. shea moisture curl n shine shampoo \n\n2. Shea M manuka honey &amp; yogurt hydrate + repair  conditionner \n\n3. Shea M jamaican black castor oil strengthen and restore curl cream​ \n\n4. Flaxseed gel (DIYed). \n\n5. Sometimes i use grapeseed oil on my scalp.\n\n6. I clarify using a sulfate based shampoo occaisionally (Le petit marseillais force et eclat)\n\n7.I blow dry with cool air\n\n8.i sleep in with a silk/satin bonnet and a satin pillowcase \n\n[9.No](http://9.No) refresh routines, curls refuse to revive if manipulated after styling\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ichsjvejlcg1.jpg?width=3456&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d49ef1a166910c5d8567ae53a172694b3cb412ff\n\n",

      "content": "I have a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn’t irritate my sensitive, hyper-reactive skin. I recently watched a dermatologist on YouTube talk about the benefits of urea, and it really caught my attention. Apparently, it’s extremely hydrating and can help soften uneven, textured skin. Since I have an impaired skin barrier and noticeable texture, it seems like something that could be beneficial for me.\n\nI also realized that I’ve never actually used a product containing urea. Most American skincare brands tend to rely on humectants like glycerin or hyaluronic acid instead. From what I’ve seen, urea seems to be much more common in European and Asian skincare.\n\nHas anyone here used products with urea? If so, did you notice an improvement in hydration, texture, or overall skin health?",

      "content": "I've started taking care of my curls in like, I would like to say March 2025, if not earlier. It was a drastic decision where I chopped off most of my hair. After that I started trying to care for it. My moms previous chemical straightening had ruined most of my hair beyond repair so that's why I kind of chopped it off. Now almost a year into hair care, I still haven't gotta a haircut again just letting it grow for now. \n\nI've spent alot of time and money on products and testing them out, they work in every other department but frizz. Like my hair doesn't fallout/break beyond what you expect with detangling and stuff, its shiny, (it does lose its shine after a few days) it grows at an average speed, and its like a lot of hair, like I guess its thick rn but its slightly thinning out to how it naturally is, and its curly like 2A-2B.\n\nSo my routine like how I wash and style is basically. Ill get it wet (obviously), then ill go in with usually a Kristen Ess shampoo (I have no clue which type, its usually the pink one or the green one) but when I don't have that I use this tresmme anti breakage with vitamin blend or whatever. Then I go in with the Monday Smooth Shampoo, I used to be the Monday volume but then I switched. This is also when I detangle with a brush and like really get in there. Then for conditioner currently I'm using the blue Skala, used to be the Monday Smooth conditioner with a mix of Kristen Ess. I rake the skala through and give it like 10 minutes then I wash it out with cold water after that while its straight up soaking, since the Skala is also a leave in I'll rake it through my hair using my fingers and then use an athletic shirt to scrunch since the fabric is smooth and absorbs well, after that Ill do around 2-3 pumps on each side of the Shea moisture frizz free moose, and ill scrunch that in after that is like no touching and I let it air dry. \n\nThats it and god no matter what I do it will always be frizzy, and its so annoying because I have friends with the same curl type is just shampoo and conditioner for nice and smooth and soft and frizzless hair so any advice who be appreciated",

      "content": "Recently started growing out my facial hair for the first time and unsure if I need to adjust my skincare routine. Only been a few weeks so going through an awkward patchy phase. I have rosacea and sensitive skin so want to make sure that I’m still looking after the area.\n\nOne of my main concerns is using CC creams and moisturisers. Is there a way to blend in a green based cream so that it looks consistent with the rest of my face? At the moment, it just clings to the hair and is only slightly helped by a makeup sponge.\n\nShould I also continue to use treatments like azelaic acid on the area? Is there anything I need to avoid? Have a decent amount of what seems like hormonal acne on chin and not sure how to manage otherwise.\n\nThanks :)",
