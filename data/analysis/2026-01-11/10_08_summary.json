Hv approached many dermats as a kid n nothing helped. So I basically gave up on skincare n stuff. Only time has healed my skin. I still get acne. Like 5-10 a month including period acne) I randomly landed up on reddit skincare pages n was basically scrolling through it. Heard from some how micellar has helped them with comedones and stuff. Decided to give it a try. And ngl, with 2 days I could see drastic changes in my skin. The comedones have drastically reduced on my forehead. Micellar also helped me with acne. If there's any acne flaring up, I just use micellar on it and the next day the acne is gone pretty much.\n\nI used Garnier pink cap.\n\nHow do I use it:\nNight: I clean my face with micellar water using cotton pads or any clean smooth cotton cloth. Then I wash my face with a cleanser. Then proceed with my night routine. (Which is basically just applying moisturizer. I use ponds super light moisturizer as I hv oily acne prone skin)\n\nMorning: I clean my face with micellar water (my face gets all super oily in the morning) and then I wash with a cleanser. Apply moisturizer and sunscreen (I use solasafe sunscreen)\n\nPs: I still hv some comedones on my skin. But micellar has made a huge difference. Also it's been a week + since I started using it.\n\nI now hv to work on my skin texture too.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

      "content": "Long post ahead. FWIW, I think my hair is probably more wavy than curly, but I definitely have some curly pieces and I figured it would be better to post here than [r/wavyhair ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wavyhair/)because this sub seems to have more activity. Images above are my hair after getting wet and then air-drying with some scrunching, but no product.\n\nFor some background, I used to have very curly hair as a toddler but then it straightened out somewhat as I got older. My parents never really knew what to do with my hair, as it’s always been very thick and unruly— my mom’s hair has only the slightest wave and from what I’ve heard, my dad‘s used to be pretty curly, like perfect ringlets, but he grew up keeping his short and now doesn’t have any, so not much help. Basically I’ve gone through my whole life with my hair looking like a puffy mess— I regularly attack it with a plastic brush, and sometimes I use detangler too, but still it’s pretty much a pyramid of frizz by the time I get home every day. It also has a tendency to develop snags and tangles in specific patches— there’s a pretty nasty one in the back that always seems to develop no matter what I do. I’ve grown up being told by stylists that my hair has some natural curl to it, but I don’t know how to treat it so I just default to the treatment I was raised with meant for straight hair, and the cycle repeats itself. Until very recently, my routine has just been whatever shampoo and conditioner we keep in the shower, then brushing my hair out once it’s dry, but clearly that hasn’t worked very well for me. For the past few weeks, I’ve been washing with Super Nature Aloe Shampoo (not specialized for curly hair, but the label says it is sulfate-free) and Aussie 3-Minute Miracle Moist Detangling Conditioner every couple days, going through with a wide-tooth comb in the shower, scrunching, and wearing a bonnet to bed, and that’s definitely made my hair easier to manage, but it’s still not quite where I want it to be. I just feel so overwhelmed with all the different products and routines and I’m not sure where to start.\n\nMy main goal is simply maintaining my overall hair health, as I think years of treating it like it’s straight have probably led to some damage, judging by how easily it gets frizzy and tangles. But I’m also hoping for a more defined wave or curl pattern. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to get it back to where it was when I was little, but as you can see from the pictures, it‘s pretty curly in the bottom layers and closer to my neck, then the outer layers are more limp, with just a few curly pieces. I’d like to get that same kind of definition on the outer layers too if possible, but I’m not really sure how to achieve this.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

I really want to smell like a warm, elegant, orange-vanilla mocktail. However, I’ve run into a dilemma. I don’t have a budget, and I’ve been looking into higher-end products, but none of them seem to have good vanilla body washes that don’t have a million other scent in them that I don’t want. And when I look at cheaper options, they’re always sugary vanilla instead of warm/spicy vanilla. I don’t wanna smell like a sugar cookie! I hate sugar! I guess finding orange products is a little easier, but I still need recommendations. I can’t find any higher-end products with good orangey-citrus scents. Also, what types of things do I need to complete my routine? So far, I’ve only been searching for washes, oils, perfumes, and lotions. But is there anything else? The photos I’ve included are just there to provide a visual for the VIBE I’m going for, by the way. Other scents I enjoy include jasmine, lavender (slightly), and sometimes florals.",

My hair seems to break off around this length so I’m going to see if frequent trims helps it get longer. But if I’m going to the salon, should I get some layers and if I do, how extreme should I go?\n\nLast pic is just to see what layers may look like. I don’t know if cutting the top layer super short will make the tops curly bc I think my hair grows kind of straight at the root. \n\nRoutine: \n\nWash: Suave clarifying shampoo 1x or more a week, tresemme shampoo and conditioner. Occasionally use Trader Joe’s hair mask. Would love recs for shampoo and conditioner but I def do better with some sulfates than none\n\nStyle: squish to condish, rinse up side down, add Kevin Murphy mousse to roots and scrunch, add quarter size of Not Your Mothers Curl Talk gel and scrunch. Spray with Not Your Mothers salt spray and diffuse (mostly right side up, but sometimes upside down) \n\nSleep/refresh: pineapple bun, sometimes a hair buff. Not ideal so I usually do a pretty heavy spray refresh every morning and diffuse to mostly dry. Occasionally use the vents in my car to dry the rest. Which is fun to see if you drive past me at a red light\n\nThanks!!",
