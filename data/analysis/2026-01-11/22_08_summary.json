I go in with the condish, then the cream and gel, then diffuse, then clap out with oil. \n\nI sleep in a satin bonnet, and haven't found a refresh routine yet that works. \n\nSituation:\n\nDuring covid, I watched too many tiktoks and decided to try bangs. It was a mistake. I am growing them out, but now I am super thick around my head and it gets noticeably thinner towards the ends. \n\nI am weirdly attached to the length. It is down past my waist. BUT, I think it might look better if I cut it maybe at the level I suggested in the pic. My hair is healthy to the ends. I just had a cut 3 weeks ago. \n\nMy husband just tells me it looks fine, but the more I look at it, the more I think this needs to happen. \n\nIf this were your hair, would you cut it? If so, around the same location I indicated?\n\nAlso please forgive the frizz. I'll figure that part out at some point, I hope. \n\nThank you for any/all advice!",

By Oct 13th my acne had started. \nBy November i was convinced it was the Azelaic acid making me purge, so i stopped using it and Dec/Jan now my acne is the worst it’s ever been. I occasionally use the Azelaic acid when my face is super red and inflamed but i stopped using it consistently. \n\nIve never had acne until this moment, so its hard accepting the fact that it wont just go away. Everyone keeps telling me to get on Spirolactone but im kind of scared of anything hormonal.. I was thinking differin gel but I dont want to keep purging. I dont know what to do.\n\nI also started smoking weed again in December and some people think my flare ups are from that. Not sure if I believe that because i used to be a daily smoker and never had acne.. \n\n\n\nroutine right now is just\nAM: \n Vanicream gentle cleanser\n Neutrogena hydroboost water gel \n\n\nPM: \nmicellar water to take off makeup\nVanicream gentle cleanser\n Neutrogena hydroboost water gel \n\nkeeping the routine simple in hopes my face calms down ",

Hv approached many dermats as a kid n nothing helped. So I basically gave up on skincare n stuff. Only time has healed my skin. I still get acne. Like 5-10 a month including period acne) I randomly landed up on reddit skincare pages n was basically scrolling through it. Heard from some how micellar has helped them with comedones and stuff. Decided to give it a try. And ngl, with 2 days I could see drastic changes in my skin. The comedones have drastically reduced on my forehead. Micellar also helped me with acne. If there's any acne flaring up, I just use micellar on it and the next day the acne is gone pretty much.\n\nI used Garnier pink cap.\n\nHow do I use it:\nNight: I clean my face with micellar water using cotton pads or any clean smooth cotton cloth. Then I wash my face with a cleanser. Then proceed with my night routine. (Which is basically just applying moisturizer. I use ponds super light moisturizer as I hv oily acne prone skin)\n\nMorning: I clean my face with micellar water (my face gets all super oily in the morning) and then I wash with a cleanser. Apply moisturizer and sunscreen (I use solasafe sunscreen)\n\nPs: I still hv some comedones on my skin. But micellar has made a huge difference. Also it's been a week + since I started using it.\n\nI now hv to work on my skin texture too.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Since this was my daily routine I never bothered to treat the acne as I knew it would only come back because I was triggering it day after day.\n\nThe issue is I haven’t worn this garment in \\~6 months now. The longest I leave between showers is 3 days, I’ve even tried adding facial acne cleanser to my shower routine and using some acnicide cream my doctor prescribed. If anything the acne has gotten even worse ??\n\nSome of the spots are actually so painful I can’t lie on them at night, also summer is coming up and I really don’t want to have to keep my shirt on out of embarrassment :(",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm 19 years old, and I have shoulder blade length wavy/curly thick hair (I think 2B-2C ish?). Just about two years ago my hair basically took a turn for the worse and I started having to wash it every day / every other day. Before this I could go about a week without washing it. Now whenever I wash it it doesn't really feel totally clean, almost like it's still coated in something. It also gets oily incredibly fast at the roots. I usually wash with two different shampoos, just so it will feel clean enough. I also rinse for like 10 minutes very thoroughly, so I don't think buildup is the issue. It feels like I've tried everything: hair mask, hair oil, clarifying shampoos, washing in distilled water, using only one shampoo, conditioner only on the ends, no conditioner, scalp scrub, hard water shampoo, sulfate-free shampoo, shampoo with sulfates, etc.\n\nMy current hair wash routine is:\n\n**Wash first with Redken Color Extend Magnetics Shampoo (my hair has never been colored, just using this bc my hairdresser recommended it)**\n\n**2nd wash with Head and Shoulders Bare Shampoo**\n\n**Rinse for a looooong time**\n\n**Condition with NYM Conditioner (only on ends)**\n\n**Airdry (using microfiber towel)**\n\nCould it just be the water where I live? I live in a metropolitan area that's known for having hard water, but it doesn't affect anyone else in my family. I've heard of this issue a few times from people with wavy or textured hair, so it might have something to do with that?\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions AT ALL please let me know. This is something that's driving me bananas and has been a little upsetting, since my hair really feels too unclean to do any sort of fun hairstyle with. Thanks!",

I kind of like the cuts in the last photos, but I don't know exactly how to ask for them or if they would suit me, because they never turn out 100% the same or I don't know how to style them properly.\n\nAs for my routine, I wash my hair once or twice a week with Dove Oil Nutrition shampoo, then I use Garnier Fructis Goodbye Damage conditioner. after that there's a bit of a problem, my hair is fine and highly porous, I use Rolda leave-in conditioner (a Venezuelan brand) and Aloe Strak mousse, the problem is that even though they retain moisture, they don't leave me with the same volume as usual (like in the photos), But at the same time, if I don't use any of them, my hair lacks shine and definition and frizzes easily. It's a mess, haha.\n\nHonestly, I really like the \"book\" shape, if you could call it that, at the front, but I never like the sides, haha. Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated :)",

I have fine, straight and long hair and am using a curling wand. It takes me a long time since I swear half the time the curl wouldn't form. How do I make them form everytime, and last long? (How long to hold the wand, and should I use rollers, clips or simply hold it in my hand after?) What temp is best? \n\n\n\n2. False lash clusters w/ bond and seal - second time trying. The first time I felt it obstructed my vision and felt uncomfortable. Tips for better application? How close to your waterline should they be? And is mascara better for before or after? \n\n\n\n3. Foundation - second time trying it. (LYS stick foundation). Is this a good order for maximum lasting power: Moisturize, prime, foundation, concealer, powder, setting spray. And where should I insert my powder blush and bronzer?\n\n\n\nThanks in advance! ",

      "title": "2 years on Dutasteride/Minox, so much hair loss, not sure where to go from here",
      "content": "10 years ago I started Finasteride and topical minox (rogaine) once a day. At the time I think I was a norwood 4 and now I believe a weird 5. Back then I had a huge bald spot on the crown with a couple hairs left, temples were receding, hair all over was thinning. But I still kind of had hair. I've been shaving my head for 20 years, but not everyday if I am lazy about it. Even with the receding temples I still didn't mind my head that much back then because I shaved it often and I could see that 5 o clock shadow covering a decent part of my bald head at least looking at me straight on. I guess that is what I mean by I kind of had hair. I wasn't happy, I was balding, but I had something. I thought I was doing something great for myself by starting these meds. I had high hopes for Finasteride and Rogaine. But it didn't work. I was very slowly losing hair. Not aggressively, but I could see it happening. I hung in there for years hoping something would change for the better or I would at least stop losing hair. Heard about Dutasteride 2 years ago and jumped on it. Slowly made the transition to Duta from Fin with advice from Reddit people. I really thought this would work. Still doing my topical minox. But in the past 2 years things have gotten worse. The crown's bald spot is getting bigger, my temples are really receding big time, and my hair is thinning out really bad especially in the front to mid scalp. The biggest change I have noticed on Duta is the receding hairline. And the thinning of the front/top. I should note I also tried microneedling when I first switched to Duta. Hoping between the switch to Duta and Minox and microneedling, I'd have a good chance. I'm honestly not sure if microneedling worked. It might have just a little bit. A little bit wasn't worth it to keep going because I didn't enjoy that at all. I did what I read on here. 1.5 dermaroller, once a week. I just can't see myself doing that forever. Lack of visual results is discouraging as well. I wasn't seeing anything new happening. So I stopped after about 2 months. \n\nSo nothing has worked and I'm depressed about it. Yes I shave my head. But I am not happy being bald. I'm just content with it if I have somewhat of a 5 o clock shadow there. But there is no question my hair has gotten much worse since starting Duta. I can tell when I am bald and when I grow my hair out a little. I can't say \"Duta cause this\". I just know hair loss accelerated once making the switch. That's all I know. I'm not sure if I should hang in there. I feel like I will be completely bald in a year from now at this pace. I am thinking of switching back to Fin because at least I was very slowly losing hair. But then I am switching back to something that wasn't actually really working. Fin wasn't stopping my hair loss. Just stopped it better than Dut. After 10 years of this I am just very annoyed. I can't give up though. I'm not okay being bald. I've looked into other stuff. The SMP I've thought about a lot but 99 percent of the ones I see do not look natural and I can't imagine it looking any better up close in real life. But, I still consider it because might be my only option. It's just, when I shave my head, there are no dots on my head, not even small ones. I'd want SMP to match my shaved head and I don't think anyone can pull that off. I don't want dots. I've never seen it in real life though so I have no idea. And then I could do Hair transplant - well what is the point if I can't even make these medications work right? I really don't want to spend the money on a transplant anyways. But I would to get hair. But all those doctors say you have to stay on Fin or Dut to make it work so what's the point. I believe oral minox would give me results. But, I just can't. I do not want more body hair or face hair. I have enough problems. I hate body hair and extra face hair. It's so crazy how to get hair back on my head I have to get hairy all over. I've read enough people saying they get really hairy everywhere. I guess that doesn't bother them but it bothers me. If I was guaranteed a full head of hair on oral minox, sure make me hairy all over. But with my luck. I'll just lose more hair on my head and gain more hair on my body. I saw one of those red light therapy baseball caps on Amazon tonight for under $100. Could that work? lol. I mean right next to it is the helmet for $800. So I guess that would mean the $100 is junk? I can't spend more than $100 to test one of these things because I have no idea if they will work. I do Keto, and take no vitamins. Maybe that would help? But I don't see that turning things around much at this point. I see the pills for saw palmetto but not sure. Biotin but not sure. I'm reading about topical fin and topical dut. But I don't know. How would I decide between the 2? Flip a coin. If the pills and minox don't work why would they though? Could taking 2 pills of Dut a day make a difference? Or one of those full 5's of Fin a day? I asked my derm and she said she won't prescribe that. When i first started this HIM's was not a thing. Now I see it everywhere. Should i be going through them for the same stuff? Maybe there is something magical in there? \n\nSome of you have great dermatologists. The derms I have gone to promote that they do hair help, yet seem to know nothing. It's as if they read an article or two. And I bring up what I read on Reddit and they say \"stop reading Reddit\" lol. The people on here know much much more than the derm's I have met.  I had an appointment yesterday and asked her what I should do and she just said it's up to me and rushed me out. Is there somewhere else I can go to talk about these medications? Bosley or something? I called them and they just wanted to talk about hair transplants though. I can sit on here and read every posting and in the end it's not really helping. This works for some people, and doesn't for others. I'm just unlucky. And jealous of those I see this working for. I want to fight for the hair I have left on my head but not sure what to do from here. ",
