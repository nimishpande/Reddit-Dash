Some of these products were recommended to me by a korean skincare store staff member. I am using Tretinoin .025% 3 times a week, so I’m trying to prevent dryness. Here are my products currently:\n\n•\t⁠Elemis dynamic resurfacing facial wash\n\n•\t⁠Haruharu black rice hyaluronic toner\n\n•\t⁠Cosrx propolis synergy toner\n\n•\t⁠Clindamycin phosphate lotion 1% (prescription)\n\n•\t⁠ma:nyo bifida biome concentrate serum\n\n•\t⁠Haruharu black rice hyaluronic anti wrinkle serum\n\n•\t⁠Cosrx Snail 96 Power Essence\n\n•\t⁠Skin1004 Centella Ampoule\n\n•\t⁠Dr. Ceuracle Kombucha Tea Essence\n\n•\t⁠VT Reedle 50\n\n•\t⁠illiyoon ceramide ato concentrate cream\n\n•\t⁠Biore UV Aqua Rich sunscreen\n\nAlso on the way I will soon have:\n\n•\t⁠innisfree green tea hyaluronic glow eye and face roller ball\n\n•\t⁠cosrx advanced the vitamin C 23 serum.\n\nMy skin type is combination but on the drier side. I’m on the east coast in the US, so it’s pretty dry right now. I also have some dark spots and scars from previous acne. I’d really appreciate some wisdom from you all! As of late during day and night I was using the HA toner and serum but it gave me some dry patches, so I stopped using the HA serum in the morning and that seems to have helped.\n\nThank you &lt;3",

Shampoo with Pantene PRO-V curl perfection \n\n2. Condition with OGX coconut milk conditioner\n\n3. Comb with a wide tooth comb\n\n4. Scrunch with a dollop of Awapuhi hydro cream whip \n\n5. Air dry\n\nI have also recently tried plopping, I have tried forming curls with my fingers and holding them, I have tried twisting my hair but it all results in the hair in the last two pictures which is undefined and messy.

I feel like I’m mid purge rn with my current tretinoin too (last picture is from today)\n\nI saw a pharmacist and they recommended I switch the tretinoin micro gel 0.04% instead of adding azelaic acid to my routine, but that they would prescribe me whichever I choose.\n\nI’m currently using tretinoin gel .025% for the last 7 weeks. I’m only using it 3x a week with sand which method and working my way up. I notice I’ve had persistent PIE marks for about 4-5 months now that haven’t changed much if at all. \n\nI am wondering if I should stick with my current tretinoin and start using Azelaic acid in the morning? Or following the pharmacists recommendations and switch to only using tret micro gel? Thanks guys :) feeling really stuck.\n\nROUTINE:\n\nAM:\n\nCetaphil gentle skin cleanser, cetaphil moisturizer (lotion-not cream), la Roche posay tinted mineral sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\nCaudalie Vinoclean makeup removing cleansing oil-&gt; emulsify and wash off -&gt; cetaphil gentle skin cleanser\n\nOn tretinoin nights: (3x a week, spaced out):\n\nApply light layer of moisturizer, wait 30 min, put pea sized amount of tret on, wait 10-15 min, put more moisturizer on (thicker layer) \n\nOn non tretinoin nights: just a good amount of my cetaphil moisturizer \n\nHISTORY of my skin:\n\nI am 21F and have had acne since I was 14. I started tretinoin awhile ago and used for 6 months, then my doctor gave me clindoxyl when it wasn’t working to use at the SAME time and it completely ruined my barrier. I stopped everything for 2 months and cut out makeup as well. Then I started using tretinoin slowly again when I had no burning for atleast 3-4 weeks.",

      "content": "Ive got longer past shoulder length hair, pretty much all my life i just shampoo/condition it once ever 3 ish days or if it gets extra dirty. Until recently, the tangles and matting were just combed out with a wet brush and some cursing when extra rough.  But age is finally showing, so I'm trying to crash course myself on hair care to squeak out my last few good years with it before she leaves me. To that end im trying to sort out why/how it keeps getting so tangled every night and how to stop it, so I'm not ripping it out.\n\nroutine:  \nSo far, I've started using a wet brush every morning and again at night to lessen how much it gets messed up, which has improved things\n\nI use shampoo and condition every other day and try to massage the conditioner through the hair and \"comb it\" through with my fingers to remove the knots\n\nMy partner recomended i start using rosemary oil to encourage the hair to strengthen and toughen it up, and apparently it helps it stick around on my head longer. Not sure about the last part, but can't hurt to try, but any truth to the first part? Anything that might work better?\n\nAny other ideas are gladly welcome.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",
