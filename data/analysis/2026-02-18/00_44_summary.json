      "content": "\nHOW TO KEEP THE FOOF BUT ALSO HAVE SOME DEFINITION, I AM DYING OVER HERE. I don't want to use the BounceCurl method for forever. Maybe special occasions. It's long, tedious and I just want a quick routine for during the week.\n\nI hate that unless I do my usual routine to an exact T, I look wavy at best.\n\nListen, I don't know who to go to in regards to this. I am very self conscious about my curls. Honestly, I found a routine and pairing with the bounce curl brush that makes it look \"good\" mostly but I am constantly fluffing it. I find the bounce curl brush leaves me with a lack of volume. (I have tried both brushes) My hair is thin and low porosity. The bounce curl defines my curls but just lacks the volume I want. Even after separating they always go back to that form and ends up looking flat. If I have the proper volume my hair doesn't look as thin. When I brush out my hair it goes full poodle. I want like a semi controlled poodle look but also something that has a little definition. \n\nAnyways, I saw a routine that said Low Porosity hair needs to be more on the damp side in order for our curl type to soak in the products. Otherwise the hair is to full of water to soak up everything you use. My brain immediately was like oh this checks out maybe. So this morning I decided to try it. (Now I did not was my hair, just rewet it, I have strands on the back of my neck that straighten out quickly as they are more wavy, so by day 2-3 it looks ridiculous next to my curls) I squeezed out excess water. Got dressed. Came back. \n\nPer video instructions I did:\n\nApply leave in conditioner on damp hair (I used curlsmith light leave in cream)\n\nBrush through with a regular brush\n\nApply gel (I used innersense gel)\n\nFlip head over, comb hair with fingers longways going down the hair shaft, hold the bottom of your hair and \"wobble\" (aka shake) as she says, once completed take your fingers side ways through your hair then \"wobble\" at the ends (I don't think I wobbled enough idk)\n\nOnce done it said brush again once more with head flipped over (said with a wide tooth this time but I can't find mine) \n\nThen apply the oil to help seal in the moisture which makes sense to my brain\n\nThen diffuse (with the styling on damp hair, it made the process much quicker to diffuse at least)\n\nUsually I use a mousse then put gel on last but I decided to follow instructions. I think I failed at the wobble wobble part? Idk. But I'm going to throw in a picture on what my hair looks like during my weekly weekend wash vs what it looked like today lol. 🥲\n\nDoesn't help that my husband was like you look good, and I was like really? Sarcastically of course. To insinuate that my hair obviously looks different than what he is used to and he played dumb like he had no clue what I was talking about until I said something and then he was like it doesn't look bad. As if that's a compliment 🥀 I am very much self conscious about my hair on a day to day. If my hair doesn't look how I want it to look then I generally don't have the best days because I will keep trying to fix it throughout the day.\n\nAnyways. Any thoughts behind the theory? Anyway I can keep the foof without loosing my definition?\n Obviously this way was way easier on all sides of the spectrum, no sectioning, no bounce curl, just gel and raking through. Even drying was nicer because it didn't take as much time.  I would like to just mix these two pictures together somehow lol. Would adding the mousse before gel help potentially? \n\nFirst picture is of today's routine\n\nSecond picture is my usual weekly wash and style. Help",

The Japanese FDA determined that the starting dose of dutasteride for treating androgenetic alopecia should be 0.1 mg and that, if necessary, doctors can titrate up to 0.5 mg.\n\nhttps://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(13)01171-7/abstract\n\nOne study used as the summary basis of approval for low dose dut in Japan suggests that one may expect slightly better hair growth with 0.1 mg oral dutasteride compared with 1 mg or even 5 mg oral finasteride; Harcha et al. randomized 917 men with androgenetic alopecia to dutasteride 0.02 mg, 0.1 mg, or 0.5 mg daily, finasteride 1 mg daily, or placebo for 24 weeks. They found dutasteride worked in a dose dependent way, and the 0.1 mg dose produced higher hair counts and thicker hairs than placebo, with results that generally trended better than finasteride 1 mg, even though the clearest and most statistically robust superiority over finasteride showed up with 0.5 mg.\n\nIt may be that this lower oral dose of dutasteride is intended for someone who wants to further reduce scalp DHT but doesn’t want to fully commit to the 0.5 mg dose, or for someone who doesn’t tolerate 0.5 mg well and still wants to use the drug to some capacity.",

(For some reason their sub is flagging my post and deleting it), so if you were someone who gave me advice there, thank you! This is way more of the look I was hoping for although still dealing with some frizz. I am also planning to try a mousse to see what that does for my hair. Also, once I use up this gel might switch to a stronger one so that I can maybe get away with less product. \n\nLast photo is the before from yesterday’s post. \n\nNew routine:\n\n\\\\- Washed with kerastase sea salt scrub to try and clean old product out of my hair\n\n\\\\- Skipped my ouai shampoo since it might be weighing my hair down\n\n\\\\- Used my redken all soft leave in conditioner, but only from midway to ends and made sure to avoid roots.\n\n\\\\- Put in a little gel and then tried to twist small sections of my hair (I don’t have a good tool for this yet so I just used my fingers)\n\n\\\\- I SKIPPED adding my devacurl curl cream just in case it’s too heavy for my hair as some people suggested.\n\n\\\\- I took way more of my light defining devacurl gel than I usually use (as someone suggested) and ran it along the sections I had twirled.\n\n\\\\- I used a diffuser on both sides of my hair and flipped my head upside down as well as over on both sides. I did it until I think it was 75% dry (although I wasn’t quite sure).\n\n\\\\- I took a microfiber hair towel I have and set my hair in it. Then I very gently put it on top of my head to encourage more volume as my hair seemed a little flat on top.\n\n\\\\- I took it out about 1.5hrs later and let my hair get completely dry (thank you to the person who said to let it get super dry because I think I usually don’t wait long enough before scrunching it)\n\n\\\\- Lol this still took like another 2hrs until it was really dry.\n\n\\\\- Took a dime size of argon oil I had and gently scrunched out the curls with it - still definitely dealing with some frizz, but it looks better than before to me.",

      "title": "Terrible Hair Loss Advice Needed",
      "content": "I hope this post makes sense in this subreddit. Thank you guys, I would appreciate any advice or words of support, I have been crying about this today. \n\nI have really severe, unexplained hair loss, which I just can’t stop and I don’t know how or why it’s happening. \n\nI started to have this severe hair loss about a month, or two ago. Initially, I thought this was died to damage after bleach. I used to bleach for about 2 years, until September, when I bleached for the last time and began growing my natural hair colour. Initially, after bleaching I had a lot of hair loss, but then it went away. I knew this could happen, as I already used to have some hair loss because of bleach or not having enough nutrients. But now my natural hair grew out and not only has it not stopped, it only became worse. I lost almost all hair, I had medium long hair, now they are terribly thin, with only a few long strands, they look broken, with most strands visibly missing. You can literally see through my hair when I lower my head. It looks more like a rat tail than anything else. \n\nI started doing everything to stop it. About 4 weeks ago, I began drinking hair supplements, a few more vitamins, iron, b12, and more. I started using hair oils weekly and even 5% minoxidil. I use hair masks, conditioner, and tried changing my shampoo. Even started using a soft special hairbrush. It hasn’t gotten better, in fact I find it everywhere. It falls out in the shower, I find it in my bed, a lot of hairs, on my clothes. It’s mainly the blonde hairs, but sometimes I find brown ones too, although much rarer. \n\nI went to a NHS doctor. He confirmed that it’s not balding or alopecia. It makes sense, I heard that once you bald, the line that divides your hair gets thicker and your scalp more visible, and it’s not true for me. He also said it doesn’t look like I have dandruff or a severely dry scalp. My general bloodwork is completely fine. I don’t experience any significant life changes, mediation, hormonal changes, stress. In fact, despite this issue, there’s nothing that’s really worrying me now. I was not satisfied with the visit. He basically told me it could just be a natural process of my hair thinning with age. The thing is, I am 19, what kind of thinning with age are we talking about?? I don’t think the fact that I basically have almost all my hair missing is a natural thing. I don’t think it’s natural to find about 10 or more hairs every morning, or putting a clean shirt on and finding a hair 30 minutes in. Moreover, the hair in my family is pretty okay, on both parental sides. \n\nI don’t know what to do, who to consult, when even the doctor didn’t help me. \n\nHave anyone experienced something like that? Could anyone recommend me what to do? \n\nAny advice or stories would be greatly welcomed and helpful. \n\nThank you.",

I feel like I’m mid purge rn with my current tretinoin too (last picture is from today)\n\nI saw a pharmacist and they recommended I switch the tretinoin micro gel 0.04% instead of adding azelaic acid to my routine, but that they would prescribe me whichever I choose.\n\nI’m currently using tretinoin gel .025% for the last 7 weeks. I’m only using it 3x a week with sand which method and working my way up. I notice I’ve had persistent PIE marks for about 4-5 months now that haven’t changed much if at all. \n\nI am wondering if I should stick with my current tretinoin and start using Azelaic acid in the morning? Or following the pharmacists recommendations and switch to only using tret micro gel? Thanks guys :) feeling really stuck.\n\nROUTINE:\n\nAM:\n\nCetaphil gentle skin cleanser, cetaphil moisturizer (lotion-not cream), la Roche posay tinted mineral sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\nCaudalie Vinoclean makeup removing cleansing oil-&gt; emulsify and wash off -&gt; cetaphil gentle skin cleanser\n\nOn tretinoin nights: (3x a week, spaced out):\n\nApply light layer of moisturizer, wait 30 min, put pea sized amount of tret on, wait 10-15 min, put more moisturizer on (thicker layer) \n\nOn non tretinoin nights: just a good amount of my cetaphil moisturizer \n\nHISTORY of my skin:\n\nI am 21F and have had acne since I was 14. I started tretinoin awhile ago and used for 6 months, then my doctor gave me clindoxyl when it wasn’t working to use at the SAME time and it completely ruined my barrier. I stopped everything for 2 months and cut out makeup as well. Then I started using tretinoin slowly again when I had no burning for atleast 3-4 weeks.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I knew of one girl who got her curly hair cut by her and it was really pretty so ! felt comfortable asking her.\n\nI didn't exactly expect the best haircut but what I got was really not what we talked about.\n\nThe first three pictures are the haircut I got last March and even then I thought it was super short but I ended up really liking it. Then the next two pics I took after coming home from getting my haircut. It's so fucking short and choppy and I don't know much about curly haircuts or haircuts in general but I really don't think the layers are blended and the bottom section has much less hair compared the rest. The last three pics are after I finished styling them. It does look way more curlier which is what I wanted but I did not want it this short. She has curly hair and has dealt with curly hair so she knows it shrinks up, we even discussed the longest layer and it shrunk up beyond that, even when she cut it dry it was past the point we agreed on. It was obviously too late to say anything so I just let it be and came to terms with it.\n\nI'm so used to having long hair and this is the shortest I've ever gotten. I don't really think it's hit me completely, I'm trying to tell myself it looks good and it's a good change but I feel like it makes my long and big face pop out more than I want it to, and it makes me look so much bigger. I feel like the haircut looks more like a bob than layers. I can't even put it up in my bonnet how I usually do.\n\nI don't plan on going back to her or asking her to fix it because that would just mean going shorter.  She suggested doing different hairstyles but I think it’s too short for that, plus, my back is way more exposed than I’d like so likely no. I don't really know what type of help I'm asking for. Usually my hair grows a bit fast but I go back to school tomorrow and I'm really dreading it. This is so different from what I'm used to and I find it hard to see me getting used to it. I really hope she doesn't have Reddit or is active on this subreddit be that would be really embarrassing.\n\nRoutine: (apply products all together then section and brush style)\n\nNYM curl talk bond shampoo\n\nV&amp;Co curly hair conditioner\n\nRizos curls refresh and detangle spray\n\nNYM curl cream\n\nMarc Anthony strictly curls curl enhancing styling foam\n\nPineapple method then bonnet\n\nNo refresh routine",

Including all the damaged hair, and now its taking shape into what seems like waves. \n  For context, even when I was young with longer hair it was always frizzy and I just followed the family routine of essentially a 3 in 1 shampoo and I straightened my hair a lot.  Now that im trying to avoid heat, anytime I shower it forms like a wave but theres still always frizzy. Most products are to heavy for my fine hair so I use usually some sort of loreal shampoo and conditioner, the miracle 8 water (love) and after the its a 10 lite leave in.  Sometimes ill use the glycolic loreal gloss leave in serum or the redken leave in bonding serum or argan oil but it gets ratty and dry looking most of the time.  I want to have just smooth waves if possible but I always take a brush to my hair and im not sure what lightweight products I can use.  Im not afraid of sulfate or silicone, usually it helps smooth my hair considering all the dye damage.  Its just been very ratty lately.  (Those last 2 photos are the exception. Thats a good hair day)  \n First photos- after a wash day.  2nd- after a silky bonnet and brushing.\nThe third photo is more of what its like most of the time with that frizz and lack of definition.

A couple years ago I remember my hair being closer to 3b-3c and it was really easy caring for it at the time. But now with my hair becoming more 4a and sometimes even 4b its really hard to find a perfect routine or even find a good hair day. I'll go through weeks of the same routine for it just to look fine once.\nI use umberto giannini and skala products:\n\nUmberto giannini coily conditioner\nSkala nourishing hair food conditioner\nUmberto giannini curly shampoo\nUmberto giannini coily moisturiser\n\nI have a wash day probably 1-2 times a week but I have this one extra wash without shampoo but with the rest of the products just to restore its sanity.\nI let it air dry after patting it down with a tshirt and occasionally I diffuse it but it doesn't bring good results it will increase the shrinkage and make it frizz a couple hours later\n\nI have somewhat of a coily fringe right now. I used to get fades at some point but now im trying to grow out my sides more. I trim my hair every couple weeks and line it up twice a week probably. Its very hard to keep with low frizzy and if I sleep or wear a hat/hoodie it will most likely frizz up and explode into this frizzy bomb\nI use bonnets and fine pillow sheets and they help to a degree but air will eventually dry it out.\nI have had this itch to change the hair style for a while now but I haven't found a barber or a salon that handles 4 type hair they are usually more expierenced with straight hair and will try to sheer it or cut it like straight hair which is a nightmare.\nhas anyone been through the same situation (how did you handle it?)\n\nBtw the photos I picked will make it super biased.\nMy hair only looks sane once or twice a month.",

I see people recommending showering every day but washing to often with soap will shift your skin's pH. I also have acne on my face, back and chest. It has got better but it is still there. I remove my makeup every evening and wash my face with the sebamed face wash foam. Then I apply some moisturaizer and a skin relaxing cream from NØ. I tried going to a dermatologist and she recommended me a retinol cream but it made my face extremely dry and itchy to the point that my skin was peeling. My face is mostly mixed skin type with my T zone getting oily very fast.\n\nI could also use some help for my hair. It is mostly curly/wavy with type 2c-3a but I have no volume and not curls at my scalp. I already tried a volume moose, drying my scalp overhead and leaving in a claw clip at night but nothing helps. The rest of my hair always poofs up so I look like a stupid mushroom. It is also quite frizzy sometimes and I don't know what treatments to use.\n\nI have no idea about skin and hair care and I would appreciate some advice♡",

      "content": "I’m 27 with combination skin oily in my T-zone, normal to slightly dry on my cheeks and I struggle with clogged pores on my nose and chin, occasional hormonal breakouts along my jawline, and some post-acne hyperpigmentation. I was mainly looking to improve texture, reduce congestion, and brighten my overall complexion. I kept seeing The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution mentioned everywhere, and because it’s so affordable, I decided to try it for 30 days to see if it actually lived up to the hype. For context, my morning routine includes CeraVe Foaming Cleanser, The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%, La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair moisturizer, and Beauty of Joseon SPF 50+ (which I apply daily and generously, especially while using acids). At night, I cleanse with CeraVe again, use Differin 2–3 times a week (but never on peel nights), and moisturize with Vanicream.\n\nBefore applying it to my whole face, I did a patch test along my jawline and behind my ear and didn’t experience anything beyond mild tingling. I started using the peel once a week for 5 minutes during the first two weeks, then increased to about 8–10 minutes once I knew my skin could tolerate it. The bright red color makes it easy to see where you’ve applied it, and I felt noticeable tingling during the first few minutes not painful, but definitely strong. It settled quickly and never turned into burning. I always applied it on completely dry skin and rinsed thoroughly with lukewarm water, followed by moisturizer only.\n\nAfter the first use, my skin felt incredibly smooth and soft, almost like I had just gotten a facial. By week two, I noticed my T-zone looked less congested and the small bumps on my forehead were reduced. Breakouts seemed to calm down faster than usual. After 30 days, the biggest difference was texture  my skin consistently feels smoother, not just right after using it. The pores on my nose and chin look cleaner and less clogged, even though they haven’t disappeared. My post-acne marks have faded slightly not dramatically, but enough to notice in good lighting. My complexion overall looks brighter and less dull, and I haven’t experienced increased irritation or breakouts from it.\n\nOverall, for the price, this is one of the most effective exfoliating treatments I’ve tried. It’s definitely strong and not beginner-friendly, and I wouldn’t recommend it for sensitive or compromised skin, but used carefully once a week, it has earned a permanent spot in my routine. My biggest advice is to start slow, avoid mixing it with other strong actives on the same night, moisturize well, and never skip sunscreen the next day.",

However, it does get frizzy very easily, and I struggle to keep its natural shape each day. I mostly rely on the weather to tell me what I need to do with it. If it’s too humid, it goes up in a bun. If it’s too dry, I try to add mousse in a little bit of water and hope for the best. \n\nMost of the time, when I don’t know what to do with it, it goes up in a high bun. I’ve been keeping my regular trims between 9 to 12 weeks, and I ask for a half inch to an inch off to keep it about shoulder length. I get some layering in there as well. This works, but I don’t know what else to do with my hair, and I’m looking for something fresh. What else can I do?",
