The explanation is gonna be long bc i had to spend so long perfecting my hair bc it's SOOOO picky.\n\nI didn't really unclump the bottom parts so ignore the uneven lengths.\n\nRoutine: \n\nShampoo and conditioner: Marc Anthony triple moisturizing \n\nLeave in conditioner: As I am Leave in \n\nCurl cream: Miss Jessie's Multicultural Curl Cream\n\nGel: The Doux Big Poppa Gel\n\nBrushes: Tangle Teezer and Knock off bounce curl brush \n\nFor each small section: Wet hair. Apply leave in. Wet again. Brush . Add curl cream. Massage. Brush. Wet. Add gel. Massage. Brush with knock off curl brush. Repeat for every section .  If my hair did not feel silky after this I'd wet it again and add some more gel LOL. I have a lot of hair so it took a long time. \n\nBlow drying it took even longer. If i try air drying or scrunching with a microfiber towel before diffusing, my hair will throw a fit and then frizz up. I hover and blow dry on high until there's a lot of casting and definition, then with medium heat i put the diffuser to the bottom of my hair and blow dry up. I flip my head side to side doing this. Then after i see more definition and it begins to dry i switch to cold and scrunch the hair till its half its length and just repeat that. It was still damp when i stopped so i let it air dry for a few hours.\n\nLast week I washed my hair and used Loreals glossing shampoo and conditioner. Before that I used loreals clarifying shampoo and conditioner and mielles babusu and mint deep contioner. I use those three in a cycle.\n\nWhen i sleep i normally wrap it in a silk scarf and then put  a bonnet on over that. I'm a crazy sleeper and it works.\n\nI normally hate doing my hair because of how soaked i get but i cant function with a towel over my shoulders. It's overstimulating and i hate it lmfao. But i made myself power through it and here we go! Pretty sure this is the most perfected my routine has gotten. But there's still some frizz so who knows...\n\nLOL i love it tho. So cute. I have curtain bangs too.",

So, I'm making this post to hopefully help some folks keep good spirits about this whole thing. Especially as talk of new treatments is all the rave right now.\n\nI just want to start right away with saying that regardless of who you are, you aren't alone in the slightest. Hair loss is a very common condition, and there is no shame in being upset about it. You're not bad or worth and less just because your hair is losing density or is receding (or both). It's not your fault, nor really anyone's fault.\n\nIn the modern age, there are a plethora of treatments available to you. From Fin and Dut, to Minox and dermarolling. These aren't universal remedies though, sadly, and won't work for everyone. If these don't work for you, don't beat yourself up for it. The fact that you are trying is more than enough; hell, most folks don't even know they can stop / slow down hairloss in the first place. If worst comes to worst, you can always try wigs / hair systems, and you shouldn't feel bad for doing so. You can also get a hair transplant, given that the medications helped stabilize your loss. Plenty of sources on reputable surgeons and clinics out there. Caring about how you look isn't something to be ashamed about, especially if you're more masculine leaning. \n\nOf course, you might not want to wear wigs, which is more than fair. I could literally feel my wallet die when looking at some of those prices lol. That and the upkeep for those things seems about on par with something in a museum.\n\nRegardless, you don't have to be bald if you don't want to, especially in this day and age (given you are willing to spend a lot of money on this stuff lmao). And even if you do go completely bald, you aren't any less you than you were when you first started losing it. You still have value, regardless of how you look. \n\nNow regarding the future, I'm pretty optimistic. It's a common trope to say that it'll just be five years away (regarding any type of cure), but it seems like things are definitely rolling right now in a good direction. Technology will continue to advance and with that, more R&amp;D regarding this issue and funding pertaining. Now, I don't necessarily believe things like PP405 or VDPHL01 will be our true panaceas, but from what we know about them, they'll certainly help us down the line regarding our hair loss. The future is very uncertain, but it doesn't come all at once; just a day at a time. Patience is key.\n\nRemember, we're all in this game together whether we wanted to be or not. The best thing we can do is keep our spirits up and support each other when we can. ",

I’ve been on accutane for about 5ish months now to try to reduce the oil.\n\nMy nose is has always had enlarged pores and minimal flakiness around the creases of the nostrils, but since being on accutane these pores are extremely hard and protruding. I use a cleanser (just at at night) hydrating serum and moisturizer (morning and night) and then at night I’ll top off with a cicaplast b5 cream. I also moisturizer throughout the day. I also drink a lot of water.\n\nIs there anything else I can try? I’m almost tempted to extract them (hygienically) with tweezers myself even though a derm would say not to. They come out super easily and it’s not irritating. It seems like the pores will be even more enlarged getting filled 24/7 with these plugs, which Ik is contrary to the mainstream view that extracting them is worse for your skin.\n\nI just can’t walk around with these spikes coming out of my nose much longer.\n\nOpen to suggestions.",

      "content": "Hi, everyone!  (32 F) Recently I hit a strange road block in my routine after 1 year of really trying to figure out stability in a new climate. *Absolutely everything has worsened or sensitized my skin. What should I do? (Routine in comments.)*\n\nHere are the nitty gritty details:\n\n*  I moved from an oceanic, salty air, coastal New England town (Bristol, RI, USA) with warm humid summers and semi-dry semi-misty winters, to the cool, valley of a mountain (Farmington, CT, USA) that has semi-arid/semi-misty summers and horridly dry, crisp and brisk winters.\n* I have underlying health conditions that inhibit me from taking all forms of hormonal birth control, PCOS and APS.\n\n**Skin Type (or so I thought):** Combo oily T-zone, drier cheeks, hormonal acne during ovulation and before period, closed comedone prone especially on forehead, dehydrated, hyper reactive/sensitive.\n\n  \n**Profession**/**Lifestyle:** Head Chef, 13k-16k steps per day, yoga 3-4x/week, healthy diet but have difficulties staying hydrated (only drink 6 cups a day, maybe) No make-up at work, but x1-x2 per week I will wear liquid eyeliner, mascara, face powder (loose and transparent, no foundation), eyeshadows, and lipstick/glosses outside of work. Incredibly stressful life despite my efforts and sleep consistently 5-6 hours a night.\n\n  \n**Previous Humid Climate Routine (resulting in about 95% clear skin with occasional hormonal cyst on chin or forehead.)**\n\n🔆AM: \n\n* Neutrogena Gentle Foaming Cleanser\n* Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel (unscented)\n* Wicked Soaps \"Glow\" Facial Serum (x2/week due to tackiness)\n* Sun Bum Face 50 SPF\n\n🌙PM:\n\n* Garnier Micellar Water (pink cap, if wore makeup)\n* Neutrogena Gentle Foaming Cleanser\n* L'Oreal Revitalift Glycolic Acid Cleanser 3.5% (every other day alternate retinol)\n* Neutrogena Acne Stress Control 2% Salicylic Acid Toner (Every day on forehead, chin and cheeks.). WAIT TO DRY \n* Tree of Life Retinol Serum (alternate with glycolic cleanser.)\n* Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel (unscented)\n* Spa Science Sulfur Blemish Potion\n* Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Patches\n* Vaseline on lips if they felt dry.\n\n💊Internal:\n\n* RYZE Mushroom Matcha (3-4x per week)\n* Ovira \"Bloat Control\" (1 pill every other day)\n* Maca Root Overnight Oats (I would make and eat this 4x a week.)\n* Nature's Made D3 (every day)\n* Nature's Made Hair/Skin/Nails (1 gummy every other day.)\n\n\\* At this point: I only saw a dermatologist once in Sept. 2024 when I was 30 and was met with SH you wouldn't believe.  I immediately refused to interact with them further and decided to not fix what wasn't broken.\n\n# Fast forward to now~\n\nThe above did not work **AT ALL** in the new climate. I was stunned to find acne (white heads, CCs, papules, pustules, and cysts) in places I have never had it. All my previous products made my skin so sensitive, red, and even provoked unusual dry eye symptoms that have left me dreading to open them in fear of watery blindness for 30-40 minutes straight.\n\nWhat I have tried, including the above in my new climate...\n\n**Bold = worked best/minor irritation**\n\n**Current = 🔸**\n\n  \n🧼Cleansers\n\n* Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser Fragrance Free\n* Eucerin Hydrating Cleansing Gel Face Cleanser\n* La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Cleanser\n* La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser\n* Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water\nMakeup Remover\n* up&amp;up 4% benzoyl peroxide face wash\n* Aveeno Calm &amp; Restore Nourishing Oat Gel Cleanser\n* Brujita \"Glow\" face cleanser\n* Brujita \" Santa Limpa\" scrub\n* Brujita \"Purple Reina\" scrub\n* Cerave Hydrating Cleanser (green)\n* Vanicream Gentle Face Cleanser\n* Neutrogena Transparent Facial Bar\n* 🔸Good Molecules Soothing Azelaic Acid Cream Cleanser\n\n💎Exfoliators\n\n* 🔸Aztec Healing Clay\n* Cetaphil Extra Gentle Daily Scrub Exfoliator\n* 🔸Panoxyl SA 2% clarifying exfoliant (used once on active pimples and burned)\n* **DIY Manuka honey, turmeric and oat mask**\n\n💧🩹Essence/Toners/Serums/Treatments\n\n* **Brujita \"Hechizo\" Serum (outside of t-zone)**\n* Dr. Thayer's Witch Hazel with Rose\n* Dr. Thayer's Witch Hazel with Cucumber\n* Dr. Thayer's Witch Hazel\n* COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence\n* Cocokind Chlorophyll Discoloration Serum\n* Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner\n* Livaclean Tea Tree and SA patches\n* Star Face patches\n* 🔸Polysporin or Neosporin\n* Brujita \"Peppermint\" Hydrosol\n* **Rael Soothing Spot Gel Pen**\n* **Brujita \"Nag Champa\" Hydrosol**\n* **Brujita \"Sandalwood\" Hydrosol**\n* **Brujita \" Cucumber Watermelon\" Hydrosol**\n* **🔸DIY Cucumber with Distilled Water Toner**\n* **🔸DIY Matcha and Distilled Water Toner**\n\n🧴Moisturizers\n\n* Aveeno Oat Gel Moisturizer\n* Brujita \"Vegan Crema\" and \"Crema #8\"\n* Purito Dermide Cica Sleeping Pack\n* Aquaphor\n* Vaseline\n* 🔸Cerave Healing Ointment\n* Bubble Cloud Surf Water Cream Moisturizer\n* 🔸Purito Oat-in Gel (pretty sure this is breaking me out.)\n\n  \n⛅SPFs\n\n* 🔸Biore UV Aqua Rich Weightless Moisturizer SPF 50 (stings and increases redness)\n* Eucerin Advanced Hydration Sunscreen Spray - SPF 50\n* Trader Joe's Daily Facial Mineral Sunscreen SPF 40 (clogging)\n\nI have been using INCoder and Skinsort to help with my journey, but every higher percentage compatibility product seems to be a no go. \n\n  \n\\*\\*\\* I scheduled a dermatologist appointment that took 10 months to see due to my insurance. When I finally saw her in December 2025, I shared my experience and she brushed it off claiming that my acne is nothing unusual. She gave me .025 Tret gel and cream, Clindamycin phosphate lotion and recommended Benzoyl peroxide face wash. I started the antibiotic topical and my face bursted into hives and swelled up. That took 3 weeks to clear. Once healed, I followed it up with contact therapy 4% benzoyl peroxide wash and ended up with allergic conjunctivitis and pimples that scarred. My skin is not ready for tret.\n\n  \nThank you. 💚",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I wish it could always stay like this, which is what I guess prompted my previous post.\n\n**Any suggestions on how to keep it like this for longer periods of time would be greatly appreciated!**\n\nRoutine: wash and condition once or twice a week, otherwise either just wash with water or not at all. I try to get most of the shampoo on my scalp first and then bunch up my hair on top to move around the shampoo. Throughougly rinse and then add conditioner and use a wet brush to spread it out and detangle. I squeeze with a towl to get most of the water out and then air dry, never blow dry.\n\nWash: SEEN fragrance free shampoo and conditioner.\n\nProducts: INNERSENSE Sweet Spirit Leave-In Conditioner &amp; Quiet Calm Curl Control cream",
