The explanation is gonna be long bc i had to spend so long perfecting my hair bc it's SOOOO picky.\n\nI didn't really unclump the bottom parts so ignore the uneven lengths.\n\nRoutine: \n\nShampoo and conditioner: Marc Anthony triple moisturizing \n\nLeave in conditioner: As I am Leave in \n\nCurl cream: Miss Jessie's Multicultural Curl Cream\n\nGel: The Doux Big Poppa Gel\n\nBrushes: Tangle Teezer and Knock off bounce curl brush \n\nFor each small section: Wet hair. Apply leave in. Wet again. Brush . Add curl cream. Massage. Brush. Wet. Add gel. Massage. Brush with knock off curl brush. Repeat for every section .  If my hair did not feel silky after this I'd wet it again and add some more gel LOL. I have a lot of hair so it took a long time. \n\nBlow drying it took even longer. If i try air drying or scrunching with a microfiber towel before diffusing, my hair will throw a fit and then frizz up. I hover and blow dry on high until there's a lot of casting and definition, then with medium heat i put the diffuser to the bottom of my hair and blow dry up. I flip my head side to side doing this. Then after i see more definition and it begins to dry i switch to cold and scrunch the hair till its half its length and just repeat that. It was still damp when i stopped so i let it air dry for a few hours.\n\nLast week I washed my hair and used Loreals glossing shampoo and conditioner. Before that I used loreals clarifying shampoo and conditioner and mielles babusu and mint deep contioner. I use those three in a cycle.\n\nWhen i sleep i normally wrap it in a silk scarf and then put  a bonnet on over that. I'm a crazy sleeper and it works.\n\nI normally hate doing my hair because of how soaked i get but i cant function with a towel over my shoulders. It's overstimulating and i hate it lmfao. But i made myself power through it and here we go! Pretty sure this is the most perfected my routine has gotten. But there's still some frizz so who knows...\n\nLOL i love it tho. So cute. I have curtain bangs too.",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

Until recently, the tangles and matting were just combed out with a wet brush and some cursing when extra rough.

To that end im trying to sort out why/how it keeps getting so tangled every night and how to stop it, so I'm not ripping it out.\n\nroutine:  \nSo far, I've started using a wet brush every morning and again at night to lessen how much it gets messed up, which has improved things\n\nI use shampoo and condition every other day and try to massage the conditioner through the hair and \"comb it\" through with my fingers to remove the knots\n\nMy partner recomended i start using rosemary oil to encourage the hair to strengthen and toughen it up, and apparently it helps it stick around on my head longer. Not sure about the last part, but can't hurt to try, but any truth to the first part? Anything that might work better?\n\nAny other ideas are gladly welcome.",

I don’t even wanna try accutane purely for the purging side of things, I’m too scared the purge will be so bad I’ll want to sit in my room all day the same goes for other products that purge. I really don’t know what to do because I’ve tried lots of things and I’ve had the same skin products for the last year and a bit, my skin wasn’t breaking out much before I came to uni but now it’s breaking out a lot, I was gonna do microneedling but I don’t think that’s a viable option now, I’m so lost on what To do.
