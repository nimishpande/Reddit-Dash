The explanation is gonna be long bc i had to spend so long perfecting my hair bc it's SOOOO picky.\n\nI didn't really unclump the bottom parts so ignore the uneven lengths.\n\nRoutine: \n\nShampoo and conditioner: Marc Anthony triple moisturizing \n\nLeave in conditioner: As I am Leave in \n\nCurl cream: Miss Jessie's Multicultural Curl Cream\n\nGel: The Doux Big Poppa Gel\n\nBrushes: Tangle Teezer and Knock off bounce curl brush \n\nFor each small section: Wet hair. Apply leave in. Wet again. Brush . Add curl cream. Massage. Brush. Wet. Add gel. Massage. Brush with knock off curl brush. Repeat for every section .  If my hair did not feel silky after this I'd wet it again and add some more gel LOL. I have a lot of hair so it took a long time. \n\nBlow drying it took even longer. If i try air drying or scrunching with a microfiber towel before diffusing, my hair will throw a fit and then frizz up. I hover and blow dry on high until there's a lot of casting and definition, then with medium heat i put the diffuser to the bottom of my hair and blow dry up. I flip my head side to side doing this. Then after i see more definition and it begins to dry i switch to cold and scrunch the hair till its half its length and just repeat that. It was still damp when i stopped so i let it air dry for a few hours.\n\nLast week I washed my hair and used Loreals glossing shampoo and conditioner. Before that I used loreals clarifying shampoo and conditioner and mielles babusu and mint deep contioner. I use those three in a cycle.\n\nWhen i sleep i normally wrap it in a silk scarf and then put  a bonnet on over that. I'm a crazy sleeper and it works.\n\nI normally hate doing my hair because of how soaked i get but i cant function with a towel over my shoulders. It's overstimulating and i hate it lmfao. But i made myself power through it and here we go! Pretty sure this is the most perfected my routine has gotten. But there's still some frizz so who knows...\n\nLOL i love it tho. So cute. I have curtain bangs too.",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

Until recently, the tangles and matting were just combed out with a wet brush and some cursing when extra rough.  But age is finally showing, so I'm trying to crash course myself on hair care to squeak out my last few good years with it before she leaves me. To that end im trying to sort out why/how it keeps getting so tangled every night and how to stop it, so I'm not ripping it out.\n\nroutine:  \nSo far, I've started using a wet brush every morning and again at night to lessen how much it gets messed up, which has improved things\n\nI use shampoo and condition every other day and try to massage the conditioner through the hair and \"comb it\" through with my fingers to remove the knots\n\nMy partner recomended i start using rosemary oil to encourage the hair to strengthen and toughen it up, and apparently it helps it stick around on my head longer. Not sure about the last part, but can't hurt to try, but any truth to the first part? Anything that might work better?\n\nAny other ideas are gladly welcome.",

Hair type 2a-2b. \n\nI need advice on what products to use for a blowout. I purchased the shark glossi to replace my revlon heated brush dryer but it’s not achieving as much volume.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I started using Roz hair products, the milk and oil as well as the hair mask. I’ve noticed a lot of improvement in what feels like the health of my hair and the ends especially with highlighting blonde but it just doesn’t achieve the volume I used to get. I’ve cycled through so many products over the years and I just can’t remember what used to work. \n\nI’ve gone down a rabbit hole of research and confused myself more than ever. \n\nThese are the products I currently own:\n\nRoz hair milk \n\nRoz hair oil \n\nAlterna CC cream\n\nDavines liquid spell\n\nBig Sexy Hair Gel for blowouts \n\nI have no idea what order to use what (I don’t use them all at the same time). \n\nI used to love Alterna but I think the formula changed and sometimes it leaves my hair feeling tacky. \n\nI’ve heard mixed advice from stylists on social media.\n\nLet hair mostly air dry\n\nTowel dry and dry it when mostly wet \n\nDon’t brush it wet \n\nApply products to mostly damp hair and brush through (how do you do that if it’s wet and you’re not supposed to brush it)\n\nI just need advice on when to do what, how to get volume back in my blowouts. If I should use other products for my hair type I can add something else. My hair does tend to get weighed down but can also be frizzy or staticky \n\nFor example, today I dried it with the glossi brush at like 70% air dryed, used the davines and the big sexy gel and it didn’t feel moisturized enough and got staticky.\n\nAny advice appreciated!
