The explanation is gonna be long bc i had to spend so long perfecting my hair bc it's SOOOO picky.\n\nI didn't really unclump the bottom parts so ignore the uneven lengths.\n\nRoutine: \n\nShampoo and conditioner: Marc Anthony triple moisturizing \n\nLeave in conditioner: As I am Leave in \n\nCurl cream: Miss Jessie's Multicultural Curl Cream\n\nGel: The Doux Big Poppa Gel\n\nBrushes: Tangle Teezer and Knock off bounce curl brush \n\nFor each small section: Wet hair. Apply leave in. Wet again. Brush . Add curl cream. Massage. Brush. Wet. Add gel. Massage. Brush with knock off curl brush. Repeat for every section .  If my hair did not feel silky after this I'd wet it again and add some more gel LOL. I have a lot of hair so it took a long time. \n\nBlow drying it took even longer. If i try air drying or scrunching with a microfiber towel before diffusing, my hair will throw a fit and then frizz up. I hover and blow dry on high until there's a lot of casting and definition, then with medium heat i put the diffuser to the bottom of my hair and blow dry up. I flip my head side to side doing this. Then after i see more definition and it begins to dry i switch to cold and scrunch the hair till its half its length and just repeat that. It was still damp when i stopped so i let it air dry for a few hours.\n\nLast week I washed my hair and used Loreals glossing shampoo and conditioner. Before that I used loreals clarifying shampoo and conditioner and mielles babusu and mint deep contioner. I use those three in a cycle.\n\nWhen i sleep i normally wrap it in a silk scarf and then put  a bonnet on over that. I'm a crazy sleeper and it works.\n\nI normally hate doing my hair because of how soaked i get but i cant function with a towel over my shoulders. It's overstimulating and i hate it lmfao. But i made myself power through it and here we go! Pretty sure this is the most perfected my routine has gotten. But there's still some frizz so who knows...\n\nLOL i love it tho. So cute. I have curtain bangs too.",

      "content": " \nI was using minimalist and plum sunscreens last year and they just felt very sticky, greasy or just uncomfortable out in the sun. But this sunscoop actually feels like a proper body lotion that just happens to have SPF 50+ PA++++ in it. Like i just get out of the shower, pump it out like a normal body lotion which acts as a sunscreen too 😭\n\n**Texture and feel**\nVery smooth lotion texture. Not runny, not thick and spreads easily and absorbs pretty fast. After it settles, it doesn’t feel heavy or oily. My skin just feels normal and soft. I can get dressed in a few minutes without that sticky sunscreen feeling.\n\nIt’s SPF 50+ PA++++ with broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection. I’ve worn it out in proper sun and didn’t notice tanning or redness. \n\n**Ingredients I liked**\nWhat makes it better than basic sunscreens is the added skincare.\n5 percent Niacinamide to help with pigmentation and even skin tone.\nIt has 5 Essential Ceramides too.\n\n**Full ingredient list on the bottle:**\nPurified Water, Octocrylene, Niacinamide, Octyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Trehalose, Methylene Bis Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Avena Sativa Oat Kernel Extract, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Aloe Vera Extract, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Propanediol, 1,2 Hexanediol, Hexyldecanol, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Ceramide AS, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide NG, Sodium Acrylate Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, C15 19 Alkane, Fragrance, Sodium Polyacrylate, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer 6, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium EDTA, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum.\n\nIt’s also free from Benzophenone, Formaldehyde &amp; Oxybenzone, atleast that's what the bottle says.\n\n**Hydration**\nIt actually feels moisturizing. I’ve skipped my regular body lotion a few times and this alone was enough. No dryness, no tightness.\n\nI do not write such long reviews but i am fr in love with this Sunscoop sunscreen body lotion and is honestly the most comfortable body sunscreen I’ve used. High protection, good ingredients, lightweight feel and no greasy mess. For daily use, it’s a solid 10 for me. \n\nDefinitely repurchasing!!!",

So, I'm making this post to hopefully help some folks keep good spirits about this whole thing. Especially as talk of new treatments is all the rave right now.\n\nI just want to start right away with saying that regardless of who you are, you aren't alone in the slightest. Hair loss is a very common condition, and there is no shame in being upset about it. You're not bad or worth and less just because your hair is losing density or is receding (or both). It's not your fault, nor really anyone's fault.\n\nIn the modern age, there are a plethora of treatments available to you. From Fin and Dut, to Minox and dermarolling. These aren't universal remedies though, sadly, and won't work for everyone. If these don't work for you, don't beat yourself up for it. The fact that you are trying is more than enough; hell, most folks don't even know they can stop / slow down hairloss in the first place. If worst comes to worst, you can always try wigs / hair systems, and you shouldn't feel bad for doing so. You can also get a hair transplant, given that the medications helped stabilize your loss. Plenty of sources on reputable surgeons and clinics out there. Caring about how you look isn't something to be ashamed about, especially if you're more masculine leaning. \n\nOf course, you might not want to wear wigs, which is more than fair. I could literally feel my wallet die when looking at some of those prices lol. That and the upkeep for those things seems about on par with something in a museum.\n\nRegardless, you don't have to be bald if you don't want to, especially in this day and age (given you are willing to spend a lot of money on this stuff lmao). And even if you do go completely bald, you aren't any less you than you were when you first started losing it. You still have value, regardless of how you look. \n\nNow regarding the future, I'm pretty optimistic. It's a common trope to say that it'll just be five years away (regarding any type of cure), but it seems like things are definitely rolling right now in a good direction. Technology will continue to advance and with that, more R&amp;D regarding this issue and funding pertaining. Now, I don't necessarily believe things like PP405 or VDPHL01 will be our true panaceas, but from what we know about them, they'll certainly help us down the line regarding our hair loss. The future is very uncertain, but it doesn't come all at once; just a day at a time. Patience is key.\n\nRemember, we're all in this game together whether we wanted to be or not. The best thing we can do is keep our spirits up and support each other when we can. ",

My question is.. how do i deal with it? Without any makeup i usually just use tissues to blot my whole face because its about oily almost everywhere (nose especially, cheeks, forehead and chin) but i really struggle when i wear makeup because after a little heat, my skin gets really oily and i get really insecure about it because its so shiny. Worst of all, I live in a hot and humid country so my face gets oily real quick. I usually just blot my skin with tissues when i wear makeup, dabbing only lightly. But its a real struggle because id have to keep doing it throughout the day.\n\nMy skincare is basically just cleanser (with salicylic acid), moisturizer and sunscreen. My makeup is mostly matte and powder formulas and i use setting spray as well. So despite all the matte powders i use, MY SKIN STILL GETS ALL OILY AND ICKYYY.\n\nPlease help..anyone.

      "content": "hi!! so this is gonna be a LOT because my hair journey has been a lot lol, bear with me PLS i’m desperate! (23F)\n\ni have fine, low density, inconsistently curly, frizzy, dry high porosity hair. im now going to just list out all my complaints  lol:\n\na) it curls differently every time i style it… no matter if i follow the same routine. sometimes i get cute fluffy curls, other times i get flat tight curls, or half straight/half curl, etc etc. \n\nb) it dries so fast. like i put it loosely in a soft tshirt after i shower for more than 2 minutes and it’s completely dry on the ends. or if i don’t put a towel on it and wait two minutes with my hair hanging wet, the roots are completely dry.\n\nc) it’s so prone to breakage. i have so many split ends and my hair is a different length everywhere. i did a big chop in 2023 for healthiness and it wasn’t as rewarding now that it’s grown back lol. but i cut my split ends like every week at work in small sections to keep it healthy. i also get trims every 2-3 months. should i go sooner??? its $60 + tip yall im broke\n\nd) my hair falls out easily it feels like (you’ll see why im not sure if u keep reading to the next section). i feel like ive been trying to grow it back from the scalp for years and its just getting worse or staying the same idek anymore. i do see a lot of baby hairs growing at the scalp but not nearly as many as i feel i should be after all this time :/\n\ne) even when i do put heat in my hair it just looks frizzy or doesn’t hold well. i know some of the frizz is because my hair is diff lengths all over because of all the breakage and regrowth.\n\nf) a lot of my ends feel blunt idk if that means anything. there’s also a lot of ends that are flimsy soft. also a lot of random coarse \\~\\~\\~\\~\\~ type hairs u know???\n\ng) the top layer of hair (from the crown and top of my scalp), is super thin and short and mostly straight but the middle is very curly and less fine. the underneath at the back just only curls at the end. \n\nh) hair gets greasy easily if i use too much product \n\ni) scalp can be very dry and flakey but the flakes but stick to my scalp unless i hit my head upside down. i use nizoral shampoo in replacement of ouai when this happens!\n\nOKAY IM SORRY IM LONG WINDED BUT PLS I NEED ADVICE 😭\n\nhere’s also things that are barriers and have affected my hair health (i struggle a lot with mental health but pls im still funny and cool and awesome i just have a LOT of sparkle yk)\n\na) i struggled with trichotillomania for yeaaars like pulling probably hundreds of pieces of hair out individually (not in chunks) every day. and i still engage in the behavior slightly… but only like a couple hairs here and there. im working really hard to overcome it so pls dont advise me to stop because i know and im doing so!! trying my hardest!\n\nb) i am in recovery for anorexia but i struggled with it for just as long as i did the trich. getting in protein is really hard for me because i also have arfid (im telling u guys god rly nerfed me lol). so i assume that effects my hair health as well at least in some regard.\n\nc) i definitely have a good amount of heat damage because i used to rely on heat to feel good about my hair. i would always use heat protectant and serum.. but still not great. i have made it a point to stop using heat and embrace the curl. i’m doing okay, i have only used heat 3 times so far this year which i know is lowkey a lot but im interviewing for grad school so i can’t have my hair be frizzy LOL\n\nd) i have POTS so blood tends to pool in my feet and not go to my extremities or my head?? not too sure how brain flow to POTS patients compares to that of regular people lol. but im sure there is correlation.\n\ne) one thing i know ISNT wrong is my thyroid because i get my blood work tested all the time cause i have chronic illnesses. lmk if anyone wants to know my results idk if its helpful. is that weird to offer 😭\n\nf) i have this compulsive need to play with my hair like twirl it/run strands between my fingers. i’ve done it my entire life like there are pictures of me at 2 years old doing it. i just take strands of here and run them between my pointer and middle finger lol. not sure if that affects my hair health but prob \n\nOKAY LAST PART. pls if ur still reading im almost done JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE IM DESPERATE LOL \n\nhere is my current routine / things ive tried:\n\ni wash my hair every 4ish days, almost always double cleanse, and i cycle these 3 routines:\n\nWASH A:\n\n\\- ouai detox shampoo &amp; davines energizing shampoo\n\n\\- k18 (after shower)\n\nWASH B:\n\n\\- redken extreme length &amp; loreal elvive hyaluronic plump shampoo \n\n\\- davines nounou conditioner (leave in for 5ish min)\n\nWASH C:\n\n\\- davines energizing shampoo &amp; loreal elvive hylauronic plump shampoo\n\n\\- davines nounou conditioner\n\nPOST SHOWER:\n\n\\- not your mothers curl talk leave in conditioner\n\n\\- devacurl wavytalk curl cream\n\n\\- goldwell just smooth serum\n\n\\*\\* sometimes i also use itsa10 gloss leave in spray\n\nDAILY:\n\n\\- i typically spray my hair wet every morning with water w/ a couple drops of peppermint essential oil in the spray bottle, use my bounce curl brush, and use devacurl wavy talk to restore my curl. \n\n\\- i use goldwell just smooth everyday\n\n\\- on wash day, i will wear my hair in a loose slick back using softee castor oil conditioner \n\n\\- once a week i use amika dream routine overnight hydration mask &amp; ouai scalp serum\n\n\\- i tie my hair back or wear it in braids at night \n\nTHINGS IVE TRIED:\n\n\\- minoxidil serum &amp; foam: is this fr my only/best option??? i have pets who sleep at the top of my pillow. i also find it makes my hair greasy faster and sticky/separated at the roots. i am difficult ab minoxidil bc i also wont take the pill for personal reasons lol. \n\n\\- hair oiling: did it for years and feel like it didnt rly do anything and it lowkey made it worse (i used a rosemary blend on the scalp and jojoba through the shaft/ends)\n\n\\- big chop: cut my hair to a bob already and it took forever to grow back and it didnt really fix the problem. (i could’ve done more for my hair health but i dont want to go thru that process of regrowth again)\n\n\\- ouai scalp serum: idk if i used it long enough to notice a true difference but the consistency was tough after awhile lol \n\nOK I THINK THATS EVERYTHING IM SORRY it was so long u guys but im 23 and have been struggling with my hair since i was a teenager. i just want to get it to where i want it so i can feel more confident and feminine!\n\nany tips are appreciated :,) pls ik the internet can be so brutal so be kind to me lol but also dont lie to me plsss i can handle it haha ik my hair isn’t great. only thing i wont do is shave my head!!\n\ni just want to:\n\n\\- revive my curl and reduce frizz\n\n\\- stimulate new growth and retain length\n\n\\- strengthen &amp; hydrate ends\n\n\\- improve overall hair health and appearance \n\n\\- i need silk pillow case and bonnet recs!!\n\ni posted this in a couple hair communities sorry if ur seeing this twice!\n\nhopefully at least one person reads this mf novel 😭",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

Granted it is different lighting but outside of that, it’s become more sore. \n\nThe comments on my last post made me feel pretty confident that I might be dealing with fungal folliculitis, I think it might be a combination of that and bacterial too atp but idk it could even be something else entirely. I just don’t understand what is going on. \n\nA couple things I should mention: I use dye free/fragrance free detergent, I change my bedsheets every week, I shower every other day, I shower at night and take hot showers, I sweat at night, I have hot flashes sometimes during the day, I have pcos, I have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, I use non comedogenic body products, I use medicube’s kojic acid bodywash (also contains salicylic acid), I’ve been pretty chronically stressed but I’m wanting and trying to work on it, I was on doxycycline a few weeks ago, benzoyl peroxide and SA washes have never actually helped my back acne much, I drink a lot of water, and I eat okay but not great lately.. any other questions please ask!!\n\nBut most importantly my skin is itchy!! The spots themselves range from feeling like regular acne, to just texture, to what feels like sore, hormonal acne. \n\nI’m 🤏🏼 close to seeing my derm but I’d rather come here for some insight first.

      "content": "Hi! I currently don’t have a proper skincare routine and I honestly don’t know much about skincare, so I’m really looking for guidance.\n\nMy main concerns are:\n•\tHyperpigmentation (especially post-acne marks that linger for a long time)\n•\tQuite deep acne scars\n•\tI still get a few new pimples every 1–2 weeks, and they almost always leave hyperpigmentation even though I try not to touch my face\n•\tI break out easily\n•\tVisible pores\n•\tMy skin looks quite dull and I would really like it to look brighter and more glowy\n• Prominent smile lines\n\n\nI feel like my skin texture is uneven overall. I’m a complete beginner and don’t currently use any active ingredients consistently.\n\nIf anyone could suggest what might help my skin based on the photo and these concerns (products, ingredients, routine structure, treatments, etc.), I would be extremely grateful. \n\nThank you in advance ❤️",
