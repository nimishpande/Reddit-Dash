I've tried a few things, this is my current best, and wow it's an improvement. I'm low-key shocked that my hair is this curly??\n\nI'm trying my best to take care of my hair while also navigating what's bullshit or just OTT. I also don't actually know if I like how this looks? I feel like it looks straggely? Am I just not used to it yet or am I right that it's not as fluffy natural hair looking as I would expect?\n\nThis is about 5 mins after finishing my *new* routine:\nShampoo (kerastase oily roots dry ends) just roots X2\nConditioner (just used tresemme this time but ordinarily kerastase colour protect) mids to ends, let sit 5 mins.\nOnce a month I skip conditioner and do k18 leave in conditioner (sometimes I do it more rarely, p.s. it says on the bottle to skip conditioner)\nI then added Umberto Giannini curl jelly raked through my hair and then scrunched and diffused (high heat, low speed)\nThat's it. I usually spray a little hair oil (nix?) on the ends but this curl jelly has made all my hair look almost too shiny? Is that just me?? So I skipped the oil this time.\n\nThat's it. I struggle with hygiene so this is about my max for how much effort I can put in. I use a detangler/tangle teaser rip off hairbrush. And I get my colour done professional by a colour specialist. \n\nDoes this look good and I need to just adjust or am I right that something I can't put my finger on looks off?\n\nAlso hair cut advice please! Bangs looked BAD on me, so maybe don't suggest that (also too much maintenance), I recently got a shag cut which I think I love! But any advice on a cut for my curl type and face shape would be much appreciated!!\n\nThanks so much!!",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\nI really need some guidance from people who understand skin healing and long-term damage.\n\nAbout 6‚Äì7 years ago, I made a terrible mistake ‚Äî I used a dermaroller very aggressively on my face (too deep, too often, and without proper hygiene or aftercare). At first, I thought it would help my acne scars, but over time my facial skin completely changed.\n\nHere‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening since then:\n\nMy face becamm 25M , dull, and lifeless compared to my natural color ‚Äî my chest and neck are still good, so the contrast is huge.\n\nMy skin doesn‚Äôt reflect light anymore ‚Äî it feels thick, leathery, and dehydrated, almost like it‚Äôs covered in a layer that hides my real complexion.\n\nIt‚Äôs also super sensitive ‚Äî most products sting, and exfoliation or actives make things worse.\n\nI don‚Äôt get acne anymore, but the texture looks uneven, and I‚Äôve lost that natural brightness and smoothness I once had.\n\n\nFrom my own research, I think I developed fibrosis or over-healed collagen from that trauma ‚Äî basically scar-like tissue beneath the surface that‚Äôs blocking oxygen and light reflection. I know my skin still has potential because the rest of my body is proof ‚Äî I just need to find the right way to reverse or remodel this damage safely.\n\nIt‚Äôs been years, and I‚Äôve tried being patient, but I want to finally take control of this.\nSo my questions are:\n\nWhat are the best medical or dermatological treatments to soften fibrotic skin and restore natural tone and texture?\n\nHas anyone here experienced something similar and seen real improvement?\n\nAre treatments like Laser Genesis, RF microneedling, PRP, or subcision worth considering for collagen remodeling after this kind of damage?\n\nAnd how do I rebuild my skin barrier first before doing anything intensive?\n\n\nI know my skin can look great again ‚Äî I just need to follow the right approach.\nWould really appreciate detailed advice or even stories from anyone who‚Äôs managed to bring their skin back after long-term microneedling or dermaroller damage.\n\nThanks so much in advance. üôè\n",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n¬†\n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n¬†\n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n¬†\n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n¬†\n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n¬†\n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you‚Äôve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you¬†\n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Air drying usually takes 2-3 hours which is strangely long for short hair with shaved sides and back.\n \n2nd pic: shampoo, conditioner, curl cream, diffused on medium heat medium intensity.\n\n3rd pic: I decided to add gel to the previous routine before diffusing, and what on earth did I just do? I tried to diffuse it, took me half an hour and it was still soggy in some places. It took me over 12 hours to air dry after that, then I scrunched it and it looked like this.\n\nBefore that (undocumented attempt) I tried using less gel and it did absolutely nothing except for make hair feel icky, no amount of scrunching helped.\n\nI applied gel the same way that I apply conditioner, kind of rake it through my hair with my fingers and then scrunch.\n\nProducts I use:\n\nShampoo: Redken All Soft Mega Curls, although I sometimes use Pirolam when my scalp condition flares up.\nConditioner: Novex Deep Conditioning Hair Mask (the instructions on the jar say it can be used as a conditioner, I tried keeping it on longer like a mask but there's no difference). I rake it through my hair and that's when I also use my fingers to gently detangle it (although it hardly ever gets tangled). Then I scrunch.\nCream: Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream,  applied to wet hair in the same way as conditioner.\n\nMonstrous gel: WS Academy Gel For Waves And Curls (Polish brand that's being marketed as kinda fancy). Applied in the same way as above.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the gel just has too much stuff in it and I would probably get better results with a simpler formulation. Or maybe I should ditch the curl cream and just try the gel alone. Honestly I'm losing my mind and feeling I'm throwing money into a black hole of pointless experimentation, please help me make the experimenting less pointless üòä\n\nBonus 4th pic: random cute pic of the \"protective\" topknot  I wear when cooking, painting, DIY, or when it's hot outside. I also sleep in it sometimes (the scrunchie is silk) . I generally do my best to sleep in a silk headscarf, it's life-changing because without it my head looks like an exploded pot of pasta on the next day.\n\nFun Fact: I also have a jar of Inebrya Ice Cream Keratin Restructuring Mask but it also does the opposite of what it's supposed to do, turns hair into straw. I guess my hair already has enough protein.",

Based off that haircafe video, it seems DHT causes the breakdown of elastin (a protein that keeps your skin firm, it declines with age).\n\nWhat about testosterone? Anecdotally looking at steroid users, they inject high amounts of synthetic androgens and many of them age like shit. (Except Mike O'Tren)\n\n2.5mg dutasteride reduces skin/scalp dht by 80% which is decent. But that doesnt address the remaining 20% of dht left, and it doesnt affect skin testosterone levels.\n\nWould adding a topical anti androgen and rubbing it on your face be a good addition to an anti aging routine? Since it would stop androgenic hormones from negatively harming your skin.\n\nThis obviously falls behind the assumption ALL androgens are bad for your skin. If anyone has proof testosterone (while controlling for its 5 alpha reduction to dht) by itself is good or bad for skin, please lmk",

Either way, I'm careful with my products and try to use items that won't irritate my skin. However I've run into an issue where I've tried as much as I can where I've tried cutting out parabens, fragrances, pore clogging ingredients, and use gentle cleansers after trying salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide products. None of these items have made a change as I have tried multiple moisturizers and cleansers over the years with little to no effect. This includes ones with and without ingredients listed above.\n\nThe only thing that seems to help is when I apply hydrocortisone (I know I'm not supposed to, I only do it when it's really bad and only for 2 days before waiting usually weeks to months before using it again). It does not stop the acne fully because I never use it long enough to do so, but it seems to drastically decrease it. Does anyone know why? Or an alternative I can use so I don't get TSW or thin my skin out.\n\nI'm on my last leg and going to very carefully try retinol but after this I'm at a loss.",

I‚Äôm not sure why . I visited a dermatologist, and she recommended minoxidil, saying I‚Äôd likely lose my hair anyway within five years.\n\nInstead of immediately addressing it, I decided to grow my hair long one last time and let it grow for a year. The first photo shows what my hair looked like during that time.\nHaving long hair made it easier to ignore the balding, but I noticed my hairline receding significantly. So, I spent two months researching extensively and finally decided to fully shave my head on June 30, 2025. I also started the following routine:\nFinasteride 1.25 mg/day\nKetoconazole 2% shampoo twice a week\nRosemary oil with a dermaroller once a week\nSupplements (biotin, zinc, magnesium)\nI haven‚Äôt experienced any shedding phase so far.

So that's what we should look for when buying a sunscreen.\n\nI'm not super rich so anything above Rs. 1000 is too expensive for me. I tried looking up but Minimalist Light Fluid Sunscreen and Lakm√© Sun Expert seem to be the only Indian sunscreens available on Nykaa that claim to be tested with the global standard.\n\nAre there any other sunscreens available that claim to be tested with the same standard? As consumers, we should demand for higher standards and transparency from companies.\n\nBackground: I personally use UV Doux as its highly recommended in this sub for oily skin but I checked and that doesn't post details about its testing either.",
