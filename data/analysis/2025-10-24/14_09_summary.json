I tried to diffuse it, took me half an hour and it was still soggy in some places. It took me over 12 hours to air dry after that, then I scrunched it and it looked like this.\n\nBefore that (undocumented attempt) I tried using less gel and it did absolutely nothing except for make hair feel icky, no amount of scrunching helped.\n\nI applied gel the same way that I apply conditioner, kind of rake it through my hair with my fingers and then scrunch.\n\nProducts I use:\n\nShampoo: Redken All Soft Mega Curls, although I sometimes use Pirolam when my scalp condition flares up.\nConditioner: Novex Deep Conditioning Hair Mask (the instructions on the jar say it can be used as a conditioner, I tried keeping it on longer like a mask but there's no difference). I rake it through my hair and that's when I also use my fingers to gently detangle it (although it hardly ever gets tangled). Then I scrunch.\nCream: Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream,  applied to wet hair in the same way as conditioner.\n\nMonstrous gel: WS Academy Gel For Waves And Curls (Polish brand that's being marketed as kinda fancy). Applied in the same way as above.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the gel just has too much stuff in it and I would probably get better results with a simpler formulation. Or maybe I should ditch the curl cream and just try the gel alone. Honestly I'm losing my mind and feeling I'm throwing money into a black hole of pointless experimentation, please help me make the experimenting less pointless üòä\n\nBonus 4th pic: random cute pic of the \"protective\" topknot  I wear when cooking, painting, DIY, or when it's hot outside. I also sleep in it sometimes (the scrunchie is silk) . I generally do my best to sleep in a silk headscarf, it's life-changing because without it my head looks like an exploded pot of pasta on the next day.\n\nFun Fact: I also have a jar of Inebrya Ice Cream Keratin Restructuring Mask but it also does the opposite of what it's supposed to do, turns hair into straw. I guess my hair already has enough protein.",

I feel like it looks straggely? Am I just not used to it yet or am I right that it's not as fluffy natural hair looking as I would expect?\n\nThis is about 5 mins after finishing my *new* routine:\nShampoo (kerastase oily roots dry ends) just roots X2\nConditioner (just used tresemme this time but ordinarily kerastase colour protect) mids to ends, let sit 5 mins.\nOnce a month I skip conditioner and do k18 leave in conditioner (sometimes I do it more rarely, p.s. it says on the bottle to skip conditioner)\nI then added Umberto Giannini curl jelly raked through my hair and then scrunched and diffused (high heat, low speed)\nThat's it. I usually spray a little hair oil (nix?) on the ends but this curl jelly has made all my hair look almost too shiny? Is that just me?? So I skipped the oil this time.\n\nThat's it. I struggle with hygiene so this is about my max for how much effort I can put in. I use a detangler/tangle teaser rip off hairbrush. And I get my colour done professional by a colour specialist. \n\nDoes this look good and I need to just adjust or am I right that something I can't put my finger on looks off?\n\nAlso hair cut advice please! Bangs looked BAD on me, so maybe don't suggest that (also too much maintenance), I recently got a shag cut which I think I love! But any advice on a cut for my curl type and face shape would be much appreciated!!\n\nThanks so much!!",

Also lotion helped a ton.\n\nBut last couple days I've been getting like full body pins and needles, that won't go away till I scratch, but if I scratch, I break out in hives, which then itch even more.

In a panic, I tried everything that were recommended by friends/family (worked for them!) Clinique's Salylic acid acne treatment (my skin was screaming and super irritated so I stopped), tried this organic mushroom serum (didn't do anything), and a bunch of other creams. My esthetician told me to stop everything, my skin didn't really improve from that either but at least it wasn't irritated.\n\nThen another esthetician recommended me to use **10% Azelaic Acid**, I did my research and found that Cos De Baha was the best but I only have **Naturium** available in my area. To my surprise,  after using it for probably 6 months I see massssssive improvements, next level! Not just fading my hyperpigmentation but also deep acne scars. It also makes my skin look dewy, plump, and evened out. The holy grail. I use it every night with **arencia holy hyssop serum**. My routine remains super basic. Just vit C serum then mineral Goop sunscreen in the AM and at night with a generic cleanser and the two i just mentioned.\n\n**For all of you, what‚Äôs the most challenging part about finding the right products for your skin? What works for others and was recommended to me, usually does not work at ALL. Like, where do you usually look, how do you decide if something works, and what do you do if it doesn‚Äôt? Also, do you stick to a routine, or do you change it up often? Feel free to share whatever comes to mind üòä** \n\n  \n\n\n",
