I have PCOS and grow a palm sized patch of long hair there. The bottle says to not exceed 10 minutes but I knew I had some tough hair so I let it go for the full 10 minutes. Nothing happened. I wiped it off and not a lot of hair came with. I put it on according the the instructions, I left it alone, didn't rub it in, etc. So I started letting it stay for longer and longer. I now leave it on for an entire hour before wiping it away, and even then I still have to do a second coat as there's still some left. I've never gotten a burn or pain, at most it will tingle and then be slightly red after for only a little bit but not hurt. Does anyone else relate or know what is going on here? Is my skin odd? Is my hair tough? Any suggestions or ideas would be appreciated\n\nEdit- Thank you guys for the help! I did want to mention I am very sensitive to pain which is why I don't wax or use pretty much anything that would hurt (Nair has never burned me which is why I'm comfortable using it)",

Just took it off and feel so clear and refreshed. The mask itself had two ear loops from the top half and also from the chin/neck strap. The mask was also really thick and textured/quilted which helped with product absorption. No clue where I got it‚Ä¶ possibly received it as a gift? Does anyone have any insight or can recommend leads towards a similar mask? Not necessarily tea tree, but the quality of this mask was just amazing!!",

I like the fact that it is lightweight, however I find my skin to be pretty oily mid-day. I‚Äôm wondering if y‚Äôall have any recommendations for moisturizers that can help with sebum production, cause I find my skin (T zone especially) to be sooo oily at the end of the day. I know i can‚Äôt do any miracles, but I‚Äôm willing to try other things out. I tried Thayers‚Äô exfoliating AHA toner before moisturizing but it just made my skin even more oily if that‚Äôs possible. I don‚Äôt wanna spend hundreds on products, so I‚Äôm looking for something not toooo pricey. My routine is: Spectro acne-prone face wash, night cream, and day cream. That‚Äôs it. Anyways, if anyone has recommendations, I‚Äôm all ears! Thank you :))",
