      "content": "Where do I go from here? What am I doing wrong? Are these ridiculous long locks worth salvaging despite the time, effort, and expense, or was this a fun experiment I should move on from for my own well-being? I've been growing my hair out with only two very minor trims for two plus years now. I don't know if I had/have a particular goal or vision, it was some kind of combination between \"I'm loving my little ringlets, maybe I love them even more the longer they grow?\" and a bit of a trauma response to the overwhelm of becoming a parent a bit over two years ago. \n\nWhen my hair was much shorter, I had gotten pretty great at figuring out cheap and easy-ish routines that yielded results I really liked (that would get me stopped in the street about) using Aussie Miracle Curl conditioner or Ethique's curl conditioner bar and just leaving in some of the product before plopping with a t-shirt for 30 minutes, and bam - another good hair day. I got by that way for the first year and change of growing it. I experimented with homemade flaxseed gel and had really good success with that too as my hair got longer. I started tying my hair back to get it out of my eyes and face and liked that look too... my curls make me feel powerful on good days. \n\nBut at some point a few months ago, something changed, and everything went downhill. My old standby, Aussie Miracle Curl Conditioner (paired once or twice a week with their shampoo) started making my curls stringy as soon as I put it on, rather than help the curls nicely adhere together like I swear it used to. I tried Shea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine Conditioner and had no better results. My hair started taking 7 to 10 business days to dry, even if I dragged out the plopping to an hour or more or tried a second dry t-shirt after soaking the first (and I don’t think my scalp has  been loving all the trapped moisture, incidentally). I started using handfuls of Eco Style Olive Oil gel in the shower in hopes it would help the curl shape and minimize frizz, to mixed and short-lived results. Pic 1 is the current best-case scenario, plopped and then patiently air-dried for hours. Still lots of frizz, the overall shape is weird, and the only way to keep hair out of my eyes seems to be to tie at least some of it back. Which leads me to pic 2, six hours later, tied back with the rest of the curls frizzing the heck out despite all the gel I thought I’d prayer-handed in that morning. Pic 3 is a typical end-of-night look, when the hair tie comes out and it all feels and looks like an old pile of hay from someone’s abandoned barn. Kind of makes me want to buzz it like I did after that boy broke my heart sophomore year of college. But then again… I don’t know that I will ever have the patience again to grow this much hair and endure all the awkward lengths, so would I come to regret getting rid of it all? \n\nI just did the float test on a strand of hair and when placed on the water it floated above it, but when I submerged it manually it sank to the bottom. Is it possible my hair used to be lower-porosity and now is more porous for some reason? Or am I misinterpreting things?\n\nThe five last pics after that are from 9-10 months of growth or less (Aussie Miracle Curl conditioner or Ethique conditioner bar, maybe some flax gel, a brief plop and then air dry), when good hair days felt attainable and I enjoyed the ego boost of a compliment from a stranger every now and then.\n\nI love absorbing wisdom and hairspiration from this amazing sub, but lately I’ve felt weighed down by the ADHD of it all. The thousand options for steps I \\*could\\* take have led me to total paralysis and a shame-spiral of disliking my hair and therefore not taking care of it and therefore liking it less, lather rinse repeat.\n\nI know there’s no SHOULD, but… “should” I (or would you):\n\n* Get all the ends trimmed? Get it totally reshaped? Get bangs of some sort? Go back down to a skin fade on the sides and a few cheeky ringlets on top and save myself a bunch of time and effort? Should I pony up three figures for the X-curly-technique-certified stylist or just seek out someone well-reviewed in my hood with a curly cut I like in their IG feed?\n* Do some sort of triage/deep conditioning repair treatment for my unhappy curls?\n* Try blow-drying/diffusing? I’ve never done this but am very intrigued by the potential time-savings and benefits. Can’t decide if I should get some cheapo secondhand dryer/diffuser just to try it out or splurge for a top-of-the-line situation because it’ll be \\*that\\* life-changing (Dyson Supersonic Nural or similar?)\n* Sleep in a bonnet and/or use a silk pillowcase? Would this potentially really lead to hair I could wear down on a second day without a shower?\n* Try some other holy grail products that worked for you in a similar situation? I like the idea of a simple, low-cost, low-plastic routine but if really great curls are going to require a shift in values... I'm willing to try something new, though I don't know how much capacity I have at this point for exhaustive experiments to dial in the perfect regimen.\n\nAny words of wisdom, real talk, encouragement, and/or product/routine recommendations are much appreciated &lt;3",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I learnt a lot here and want to give back to this community, so here is my Finasteride progress:\n\nFin only, 1mg/day every morning before breakfast. Started on Dec 2022 and just had my hair transplant 3 weeks ago (will post separately after unpacking and prepping the info). As you can see, I am not a hyper responder or anything, but I thought it's important to see a somewhat normal effect of hair being stabilised, which is the exact purpose of fin if I understand it right.\n\nNo side effects. I also talked with my GP before starting it and we measured PSA/testosterone levels for a base line, and everything seems to be normal after 2 years of taking the med.\n\nNo minoxidil. Since I had no sides with fin and have to take it for the rest of my life, I decided not to try minoxidil as I didn't want to add another variable, especially considering the long term use. Also, was planning a hair transplant anyway and was more focused on stabilising/prepping for HT, rather than trying to fix the situation with meds only. This is just my opinion for my specific situation, I'm not advocating against minoxidil in any way though :)\n\nI will upload and link my HT post/pics a bit later. Please keep any HT questions until then.",

Looking for any product/routine recommendations to keep her hair looking it’s best. She very rarely wears it down because it just becomes a mess and unmanageable, I would love for her to be able to have that as an option. In addition to being super long she also has a TON of thick hair. My hair was a similar texture as a kid and I straightened it every single day, but after having a baby it seems to have naturally straightened. She is getting a haircut today and will cut off a bit, but she does like to keep it long and needs to have long hair for dance.\n\nCurrent routine is very basic - wash and condition every other day with Aussie shampoo and conditioner, towel/air dry, brush with Unbrush and detangler twice a day. I’m clueless and not even really sure what type of hair she has, definitely open to a more detailed routine!\n\nThank you in advance for any suggestions!",

I‘ve seen two derms and I’ve gotten pretty much shrugged at for this after my bloodwork came back normal so I’m stuck dealing with this the normal way.\n\nProducts I have tried that aren’t enough:\n\n- Palmers Cocoa Butter (both the solid, the one with the pump, and also the coconut one): not moisturizing enough\n\n- Gold Bond (Diabetic, Intensive Healing, Retinol, Cocoa Butter Glow): Cocoa Butter Glow got the closest but it simply doesn’t last.\n\n- Eucerin (advanced repair, roughness relief): not moisturizing enough\n\n- CeraVe in the tub: not moisturizing enough\n\n- Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Lotion: this basically did nothing. Did not help the itchiness either\n\n- Naturium The Glow Getter Body Butter: VERY drying\n\n- Eos Vanilla Cashmere Body Butter: VERY drying\n\n- Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream Ultimate: not emollient enough.\n\nI put lotion on wet skin the second I get out of the shower and pat dry. I have tried layering multiple lotions, I have tried mixing it with oil (Target brand, SheaMoisture, Eos, Naturium), I have tried changing my body wash (currently using Dove Sensitive Beauty Bar, Naturium’s Glow Getter Body Wash is also tolerable), and I have tried multiple different detergents. There are no allergies that I or my doctors are aware of.\n\nWhat am I missing? Why can’t I get this under control? I have no visible hives or rashes or irritation but the itchiness is driving me nuts and even my PT comments on how dry my skin always is. Any ideas would be so helpful right now because I don’t know what else to try.",

I have been trying to figure out my \"best skincare routine\" since about 2018 and I just can't seem to get it. I try to keep it to as few steps as possible so I don't get overwhelmed (thus not likely to do it) and so I don't forget anything. I eat pretty decent, chug water only all day, and I exercise daily (most intense on the weekdays vs weekends). I work indoors and live in a very humid climate (especially in the summer).\n\nUse to have acne in high school and for the most part I get a few blackheads every now and then. But I seem to have like \"sad desaturated skin\" now. Like the dark circles under my eyes are not a shadow from the camera, they are just there. I am religious about sunscreening everyday due 1) pale skin and 2) my family has a hx of skin cancer/melanoma that has taken an uncle. I've been using retinol since about 25 but only initially using x2/week. Once I turned 29 I slowly bumped it up from 3x/week to now using every other day. I had no major side effects from this or at least to my knowledge. I swap exfoliate and retinol every other day. While I am ok with aging and the things that come with it, the retinol doesn't seem to be doing anything (i.e forehead wrinkles)?? Are those dark/discolored spots acne scars or actual acne?\n\nIf you need more info I'll do my best. Thank you for any suggestions before hand. I feel very dramatic and like I'm overblowing this considering the other great success stories I've seen here. I've just grown very frustrated with this whole thing. I've struggled with my face care my whole life and I really thought I would stop worrying about it once the acne stopped.\n\nMorning\n\n1. Cleanser: CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser\n2.

My mother straight up took me to do a laser treatment from a cosmetologist without consulting a dermat when I was 18 which obviously reversed.\nThen I went to a top dermat at 22 in mumbai who helped me with medicines and chemical peels which solved a good chunk of my problem. I moved away to a different country and  my acne was back. I have since moved back to India and was diagnosed with PCOS and my acne is well gone and stable with the medications given by my gynac. I can finally touch my face and even discovered I have a dimple.\n\nNow I am looking to solve this acne scaring problem. Makeup does not help because it accentuates the pores. Anyone have any tips or knows affordable dermats in mumbai who can help me get my skin close to regular females my age? I sadly can no longer afford my original luxury dermat 🥲  and I feel super embarrased traveling in Mumbai with this issue. ",

Both are AWESOME for body but not for face, they made me look dull and dark. But if you have very dry skin condition? The white tub will work for you\n\n3) Bioderma atoderm - very moisturizing and a bit sticky, great for body but again it gave me pimples on face. So I used it for my body \n\n4) Cetaphil - Have used this before nivea for few months, very moisturizing but made me look dull and greasy \n\n5) Venusia max - I have used both max and the simpler version of this moisturizer, It's amazingg! Non comedogenic, no fragrance and gives a matte finish!!!! But I may not order it again bcz I'm not a fan of matte finish, I like those slightly dewy finish kinds hehee \n\n6) Emolene - nice but will give you acne, so use on body\n\n7) Re'queel Ceramide moisturizer - Just ordered it 3 days ago, I like it, even the fragrance is very good but moisturizers shouldn't have strong fragrances right?? So idk if I'll get this again or not, let's see\n\nLastly I want to try my hands on Cerave😂 I'm wishing to have one holy grail Moisturizer, That I will carry to my grave!\nIt should be simple and good, and yes like drugstore products &amp; I'm not a fan of products with too much social media hype like dot &amp; key etc\n\nThanks for listening!

      "content": "I’m 25 and I used to have extremely oily, acne prone skin. I was also starting to get hormonal acne because of my gut issues. I used every viral skincare product and my face only became worse. I first went to the doctor for my gut issues, I still have them but it’s better now. I then went to the dermatologist and got pharmacy skincare and was prescribed isotretinoin(please don’t take it without doctor’s advice) for a month, along with Moisturex Hydra. Was also given a face wash, but didn’t like it much. \n\nBut, one product I can recommend is the Moisturex Hydra face moisturiser. It’s the best for oily skin. I have used everything in the market, and everything sucks. This one doesn’t feel heavy at all. My skin is far less oily now, and feels and looks hydrated. So if you’re an oily skin person and are looking for a good budget friendly moisturiser, go for Moisturex Hydra. It’s available in pharmacies and on Amazon also. And my skin cleared! This is after 6 months of using this moisturiser. \n\nAlso attached my updated skincare routine. FYI I only use the AHA BHA PHA peel once in a week at night. Please use it after a patch test. And the Asaya serum at night. It has helped lighten my dark spots after 3 months of usage. You can use the toner spray both morning and night. Dot and key sunscreen is good. But if you use anything else, that is fine too. And simple is the only face wash that has worked for me. Literally so good. \n\nThis is just my personal experience, please don’t be mad if some of these don’t work for you. Use whatever suits your skin. Thanks!",

Now, I still have occasional flare ups and rare cystic acne but my skin complexion is totally shot. \n\nMy general routine is:\nCerave hydrating facial cleanser 2x daily \nNightly Cerave Moisturizing Lotion\n2x weekly 0.05% tretinoin \n1x weekly Ordinary Glycolic Acid \nDaily Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion 30 SPF\n\nDepending on how my skin is feeling, I’ll generally do a bi-weekly Ordibary salicylic acid masque, occasional salicylic acid cleanser, and use more hydrating products like Snail Mucin 96, Cicaplast Balm. \n\nFor concern of my skin barrier I’ve cut back recently to washing face daily and just moisturizing (for about 3-4 weeks now) but my skin feels too oily and I think I’ll go back to actives. I’ve got a lot of products I’ve tried at some point or another: Ordinary Azaelic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinqmide 10% + Zinc, Ascorbic Acid 8% + Alpha Arbutin, Salicylic Acid 2%, and others. \n\nEvery time I go to the dermatologist they tell me to just continue using tretinoin and buy their laser resurfacing or micro needling, which I plan on doing soon but want to calm my skin and try to shrink my pores before investing in that for fear of making it worse. \n\nWould greatly appreciate any advice from people who have struggled similarly!! Ie, with large clogged pores, uneven texture, post acne scarring, general splotchiness, skin and lip dryness. I’d appreciate any terms to better describe my skin too! I generally have combination skin that is tight around the cheeks and oily on the t zone. \n\n\n \n",

      "content": "I've been struggling for a while now to tame the frizz at the ends of my hair. I've swapped between a lot of different routines and products to see if I could find a combination that works well for me, but I haven't really arrived at a routine I'm super happy with. \n\nEven when wet, I notice my hair doesn't have a tendency to stick into defined \"clumps\" anymore; the ends always seem to want to go off in their own directions (see pic 3), but I'm not sure if this is normal or if this is the \"it's frizzy when it's wet\" problem. Once it begins to dry the frizz of course gets a lot worse.\n\nI use a Bounce Curl styling brush and section off the top part of my hair, scrunch in styling product, and run the brush through each part. Then repeat for the top part. I make sure my hair is soaking wet for this whole process. After that, I scrunch each area once with a microfiber towel to help the drying along and then let it air dry. My hair takes a pretty long time to fully air dry, maybe 3-4 hours depending on humidity? I will usually scrunch out the gel afterwards using my hands or diffuse it with a hair dryer on it's lowest settings.\n\nThe products I used in the photos:\n\n* L'Oreal Elvive Hyaluron Plump Shampoo\n* L'Oreal Elvive Hyaluron Plump Conditioner\n* Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Leave-in Conditioner\n* DevaCurl Light Defining Gel\n* OGX Argan Oil\n\nI've also tried combinations of the following products, all achieving mostly similar results:\n\n* DevaCurl Styling Cream Curl Definer\n* DevaCurl No-Poo Original Shampoo\n* DevaCurl One Condition Original Conditioner\n* Lush Curl Power Cream\n* Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Curl Envy Cream\n\nI will use Olaplex No. 4C Clarifying Shampoo from time to time (maybe once a month to every two months?) and I've also tried Olaplex No. 3, although I don't think my hair really needs it.\n\nI'm at a bit of a loss for where to go next with my hair, I'm wondering if I just need to chop off like 2-3 inches from the ends because they're maybe damaged or something? I noticed after my last cut my hair felt a lot healthier and easy to style with the above products overall so maybe it's just that time again.\n\nI'd really appreciate any help or advice y'all can give!",

Mainly makeup remover wipes, cleanser in the shower followed by a basic moisturizer/sunscreen. I’ve never used Tret, serums and feel pretty out of the loop when it comes to advancements in skincare. \n\nI’m ready to crossover into more intentional steps and create a routine that truly helps my skin from the inside out and not just use a product because of an ad or cute packaging. I’d like to invest in a solid routine. \n\nSeems many products seem to help when used but the moment it’s not used there is not actual change to the skin. I’d like to pick products that actually improve the skin over time and not just sit on top of the skin for a temporary effect. \n\nI recently sampled Elemis and it felt really nice on my skin but I haven’t really explored any other high end brand. I’m not clear if their products just feel spa like or will make a difference in the long run. \n\nCan someone make recommendations as to which products or brands I can look into? Can you share your daily routine that gave you results? I appreciate your input!\n\n\n\n",

I just showered with shampoo and conditioner and then applied curling cream and a gel to it and let it air dry.

As of right now my routine is wash with NYM  curl talk shampoo, use NYM conditioner afterwards from mid length (like ear level) down to the ends and comb through in the shower. Then once out of the shower I use NYM curl talk mousse, about to golf ball size pumps. Rake in, scrunch with my hands, then scrunch with a tshirt. I follow that up by pixie diffusing. I dry it 90% with the diffuser then I find it falls a good amount in the rest of the time its drying. The first two pictures are an hour after diffusing, and my texture will certainly fall more throughout the day. The last picture is an example of my day two hair, I wet my hands and scrunch just to bring back some of the texture that may have been lost while sleeping, but even that texture will fall through the day as well. I am frustrated with my hair :/ is there something I am doing wrong?",

I’m too scared to leave my room at night, which means I can’t go to the bathroom to wash my face. My acne’s getting worse because of it and it’s really messing with my self-esteem, which just makes everything harder.\n\nI’m looking for cleansers that don’t need to be rinsed off at all, just something I can use safely in my room. My skin is normal-oily and I’m allergic to centella/cica. I use makeup daily but its just powder foundation, blush, and setting spray. I also commute often, so my face does get dirty from the air pollution.\n\nIf possible, I’d love something with salicylic acid, but right now I’ll take anything gentle and effective that doesn’t need water.\n\nEven one recommendation would help so much.

Not the fancy K-beauty 10-step routines or trending serums, but the surprising, cultural, or old-school traditions people grew up with. I thought it could be fun (and interesting) to hear what practices exist in different countries.\n\nI'll share mine first! This is TMI so bear with me. I grew up in the Philippines, and when I was a teenager, there was this old belief that when a girl gets her first period, only first period and not monthly, she should soak her underwear (with blood) in water and use that water to wash her face. It was said to prevent acne and give you clearer skin later in life 🙈\n\nI have no idea if this is still practiced today in my country as I haven't been home for more than a decade now. I'm definitely not saying it works but it was something I actually did at age 15 because the older women around me swore by it. It's one of those traditions that sounds wild in hindsight but was completely normal in that cultural moment.\n\nSo now I'm super curious. What skincare practices, remedies, or beliefs exist in your country or culture that might surprise people from other parts of the world?\n\nI'm also doing this for research purposes. Thank you!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
