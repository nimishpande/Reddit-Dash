(No conditioner used), use brush for curly hair to detangle the most you can.\n\n2.\t⁠After shower when the hair is still wet, divide the hair in 2 parts, left and right area, and each of those in 3 subparts: front, middle, back. So 6 parts in total.\n\nUse hair clips for this.\n\n3. Start with one of the 6 parts, and grab a smaller amount of hair from it, that is easier to manage and apply Skala curl cream and Etniker curl gel in all that piece of hair, the curl patterns starts to appear automatically\n\n4. Now define every curl from that amount of hair definitively by rolling them on your finger and releasing carefully. One by one. (do not put much tension, not so tight).\n\n5. After finishing with that amount of hair, grab other manageable amount of hair from the 1st part, and repeat.\n\n6. Do the same for the next 5 parts.\n\n7. At the end, dry the hair with diffuser around 15 minutes. Diffuser is so important!\n\n8. When going to sleep or laying in bed for any reason, use a Satin anti frizz Hat (important also)",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I used to have a great routine with shampoo, conditioner (AG ACV shampoo, Umberto Giannini conditioner, umberto giannini gel + cake mousse, flipping upside down and brushing with the Denman, finger coiling front and side pieces for definition/volume, scrunching with t-shirt, diffuse drying).\n\nAs of a few months now, my hair is barely at 3A (possibly even less curly). My hair constantly feels weighed down and over-moisturized. I've been integrating a clarifying shampoo but still feels like my hair hates everything, including my old products. \n\nIncluding two photos. The one with me alone is me with my hair at it's best a year ago. In the second, you can really see how I've lost definition. My hair does well with lightweight (not too goopy or sticky) products that still leave a strong cast. I would say my hair is medium porosity but on the lower side. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mjx05gig7reg1.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a471796f2cbe99ed6c96dbce43f590fe2bd91517\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7l40gig7reg1.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ad4a999b6bb6480604aad2c5f86b0dee418d427\n\n",

When I took out the brush tip, it's extremely thick and goopy, and not a liquid like all my other brush glues are. I've bought this before and from memory it was not so thick that it applies like a paste. 😭 When I tried to apply it to my lash strips, it was like glue that's old and has dried out (and to no one's surprise - did not stick). They sent me a new one as a replacement and it came solid just like the first one.  \n\nNow I'm thinking - does lash glue solidify in the nail since it's winter? Does anyone recommend just placing it in warm water or will that mess up the formula somehow? Am I a dummy and misremembering their formula? Lol!!\n\nPlease help!",

I know it can take time for the true pattern to show, but I’m very new to all of this and feeling a bit lost.\n\n**Current routine:**\n• **Wash frequency:** Every other night\n• **Shampoo &amp; conditioner:** R+Co Gemstone\n• **Styling product:** Briogeo Curl Charisma (applied on wash nights)\n• **Styling method:** Scrunching on soaking-wet hair\n• **Drying:** Diffuse to about 80%, then air dry the rest\n• **Brushing:** None (used to brush straight daily, now stopped)\n• **Heat:** No blow-drying with a brush anymore\n• **Sleep:** 100% silk pillowcase\n\nThat’s basically my entire routine right now, and this is what I’m getting so far. It’s honestly wild realizing how much I was damaging my hair for years with heat and brushing.\n\n**Questions:**\nWhere do I go from here? How do I figure out what my hair actually needs as my pattern starts to show? Should I be adding or removing anything from this routine while my hair adjusts? I know it can take weeks or months for things to settle, but I’d love guidance on how to support that process properly.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

Some days it looks really good without anything in it and then others it’s flat and barely any waves? Do I even have wavy hair? Or should I just stop trying to do a wavy routine lol.\n\nI've been using Nexxus volumizing shampoo, and herbal essences argan oil conditioner, the way to grow not your mother's leave in, Marc Anthony mousse, and the shea moisture curl smoothie every once in a while. I've just been trying out products. I haven't found any that I really like. I brush through my hair and then put in the leave in conditioner. Then I do the curl smoothie and scrunch. I usually do this in sections. And then at the end I make sure it's still wet and I put in the mousse and scrunch again. Then dry off the excess with a t shirt. Then diffuse.\n\nThank you in advance for your replies I really appreciate it. ",

      "content": "TLDR: hair is frizzy and falling out (lost prob 50% of my hair in the past year). I am 44, PCOS, 1 yr post gastric sleeve surgery, lost 115 lbs and still going, malnourished and can't change that right now. I need help with products to use to help strengthen, smooth, improve shine, and reduce shedding.\n\nLonger version: I do not understand hair at all. It has always been one of my secret shames as a long haired girl! My mom never cared much about hair and my sister has always been the same too. We just didn't think too much about it. That attitude is bitting me in the butt now as I struggle with aging and changing hair due to stress, age, and medical issues.\n\n13 months ago I had gastric sleeve surgery and there were complications. Anatomically, everything is fine, but my nervous system is not happy and eating is very hard for me now. I fight to get 800 calories and 30-40g protein a day. I have lost 115 lbs and its still going (which I would honestly like to see stop because I have zero energy). I am not looking for advice on my nutrition - I have a care team I am working with. I also cant add any more oral meds or supplements because of these complications. \n\nI mention it because the diet is probably a big reason for my hair loss issues. The thinning, frizz, and dullness started a few years ago though... I figure perimenopause and PCOS are to blame there. I have never really had to worry about my hair care until the last several years. My hair was always pretty healthy and shiny. My hair strands are quite fine, and my hair is mostly straight with a slight wave .. but not a nice, pretty wave. Just makes my hair look messy when air dried. If I put a blow dryer to it it straightens out completely with little effort. I try to wash every other day, mostly to minimize how much I am messing with it to prevent more hair loss. I dont know if it actually matters, but the giant clumps of hair in my drain make me think it does!\n\nI have tried using a satin hair bonnet and dont notice a difference. I have been using pantene hair serum before blow drying and that has helped some with frizz and shine, but less than I hoped. A coworker told me to try olaplex so I bought a small sample kit and i really like it so far (only 1 week in). I like the No 3, shampoo, conditioner, and No 9 serum, but could live without the bond smoother and oil (too heavy on my hair). It is pricey though and seems to be more geared towards chemically treated hair? My hair is natural (no treatments and has a few grays). \n\nSo, what should I use? Continue with the olaplex because it does make my hair look nice? Is there a better option for my specific hair needs? If olaplex is good for me, is there a cheaper, but still effective, dupe? I could use advice for people who actually understand hair, because I sure don't!",

It’s been severe like this for about 3/4 days now. Obviously, im highly allergic to whatever adhesive is used. I just got back from urgent care and got two prescriptions, one for prednisone (steroid) and one for diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and im hoping this helps because this is HELL.

      "content": "Hi! So I've been getting my upper lip waxed for a while and I've never had breakouts before. Through the years I've been to different estheticians who used different wax and products and I never reacted to any. \n\nRecently though, I've been using premade waxing strips by myself and without fail, around 48h later I get a bunch of tiny pimples specifically around the corners of my lips on both sides. I've used two different brands (both products made for facial use specifically and with good reviews) and both gave the same results. I'm trying to figure out what I could change or add in my waxing routine to avoid these! \n\nI usually wash my face with my every day cleanser, then use the strips (I never wax the same spot twice), then apply the wipes or the oil that comes with the product. I've tried cleansing again to wash off the oil after all the wax residue is gone and I've also tried just leaving it there to absorb. I still got pimples in both situations. \n\nIf you have ANY advice to avoid breakouts after waxing the upper lip I'd really appreciate it, I find wax strips really quick&amp;convenient and I want to make it work!

I like a light creamy blonde that’s warmer not cool (even if it goes against my colouring lol).\n\nWhen I touch up my highlights at the salon, I only do my roots and don’t overlap bleach on my older hair.\n\nThe problem is, due to both hard water and using heat sometimes I can tell my older hair starts to get brassier and more dull.\n\nI do use heat protection and I use L’Oréal metal detox shampoo for hard water. I also have a regular clarifying  shampoo (Giovanni tea tree invigorating shampoo - I think it’s clarifying?) as well.\n\nMy problem is, I have tried purple shampoos and I don’t want to actually tone my hair ashier and it puts a weird pigment in my hair.\n\nI instead want to somehow brighten and clarify without anything too harsh.\n\nIs there anything else I could be doing or a not really purple brightening product ? Maybe it’s because I’m using not enough heat protection too?",
