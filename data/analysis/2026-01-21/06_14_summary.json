I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

You can tell how frizzy it is by the top of my head in the pictures I used to have bangs, I think that’s where my bangs used to be the hair never really grew back to normal because when I take that hair out, it’s really short. Also, I don’t really know how to part my hair or how to put my hair when I put it down. When I parted, it looks weird and I don’t part it, it looks weird so. Most of the time I just put my hair back or in a braid I want to be able to put my hair down without feeling self-conscious. Any advice?",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I genuinely feel bad because the stylist was genuinely a very nice woman, but I wasn’t happy with my results leaving and I was down over $200. As you see in the video I am very confused on why the front pieces are so much shorter than my hair underneath, there’s also not much layers in between so it looks very blunt.\n\nI told myself I’ll let it grow out to get it cut again with my former curly cut specialist, but now I’m not sure if curly cuts are for me due to my hair texture and how I prefer it on the longer side. I know that having longer hair means less volume up top. I’ve been trying to grow out my hair, but I wanted to know if anyone has had this dilemma before. \n\nI have a lot of hair but it’s on the thin side so I also feel like it’s very see through.\n\nOn a day to day basis I only put argon oil on the ends for hydration.\n\nMy curly hair routine if I want it styled is:\n\n1. Rizos curls cream\n\n2. Not your mother’s Curl tall mousse \n\n3. Not your mothers sculpting gel (hold 3) to cast\n\n4. Diffuse cast after an hour of air drying\n\n5. Break cast with argon oil\n\nThank you for any advice. ",

      "content": "Is anyone else having issues with LA Looks Extreme Sport hair gel? I used to swear by it, but for the past year or so, every bottle I buy the gel is practically liquid. It used to be so thick and sticky and the hold was incredible, gave me beautiful curls, but now its barely holding a mild wave. If I had the gel in my hand, it used to be so thick I could wave my hand around and it would stay in place; now it literally slides off while sitting in my palm if I tilt it slightly. My routine is:\n\n\\- wash and condition with tresemme rich moisture (or any tresemme moisturizing shampoo/conditioner if that's not available)\n\n\\- bent over, squish LA Looks gel into it and separate layers in the process\n\n\\- used to air dry, now I have to diffuse if I want the gel to hold anything at all otherwise it'll just be weirdly flat\n\n\\- tresemme 4 or 5 hold hair spray for volume\n\n\\- put up in a bun and sleep on a silk pillowcase \n\n\\- once a week or so, JVN scalp moisturizer before washing\n\nThe routine has been the same for years. My hair is coarse, different parts ranging from 2a-3a depending on the day, and somewhat thin. I had tried multiple other gels prior to this routine and none held like LA Looks; not to mention the price comparatively to any other hair gel. My hair with no products in it looks the same as it has for years with no products in it. Is anyone else having this issue? Is there anything I can do to \"thicken\" the gel back up? Have I just consistently gotten bad batches for the past year+? Thanks in advance and sorry for the throwaway account - I deleted my original reddit account a few years ago but had no idea where else to ask this question.",
