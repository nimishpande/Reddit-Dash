      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,  \nI’m hoping to get some recommendations because my skin has been really acting up lately.\n\nI have combination skin with cystic acne mainly on my cheeks, quite a bit of scarring, and huge visible pores that seem to get worse whenever my skin flares. I’m already doing the usual things like regularly changing my pillowcases and keeping my routine consistent, but I’m still struggling.\n\n**My current routine:**  \n**AM:**\n\n* Wash face\n* Noni extract\n* Moisturiser (CeraVe)\n\n**PM:**\n\n* Salicylic acid cleanser (Inkey List)\n* Azelaic acid (The Ordinary)\n* Moisturiser\n* Mizon snail mucin serum\n\nMy issue is that even when I simplify my routine, my face feels tight after washing, almost like it’s dehydrated. I’ve heard tightness can be a sign of dehydration, but when I try to cut things back and just moisturise, it feels like my skin gets clogged easily or my acne flares.\n\nI’m stuck between feeling stripped and feeling congested, and I don’t know what direction to go in. If anyone with combo or acne-prone skin has dealt with this or has product suggestions or steps I should add or remove, I’d really appreciate it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ie5t15p2fl5g1.jpg?width=1740&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a42905ee0a240b1f408cb8a727c5bbd2b59abea5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hkq0y5p2fl5g1.jpg?width=1804&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd09170c95ab4ae6dfebe4cc4903f2108c591f81",

      "content": "Hi everyone I did a lash lift about 6 weeks ago now. It was beautiful I loved it however I’m now in that awkward stage where some lashes are down and some still up and it looks like a mess. I wanted to do another lift before Christmas to look more put together however 1, am I still able to do a lift while some lashes are kind of all over the place or do I have to wait for them  all to fall (don’t want to overdo it or cause damage) and 2, is there any way I can speed up the process to get them to fall down quicker? Any sort of serum or oil that might be able to help? Thanks in advance ",

I have sort of dry skin type, and my skin often looks dull.  I've heard many good things about the brand 'Beauty of Joseon' so I thought I'd give it a try. I've been thinking of purchasing these products: **Ginseng Cleansing Oil (I heard it helps get rid of sebaceous filaments/blackeads), the Ginseng Essence Water toner, the Glow Serum propolis + niacinamide, Glow replenishing rice milk, and the green plum refreshing cleanser**. I also want to get both the cleansers because I'd like to try double cleansing. Do you think this is a good mix? I don't know that much about skincare even though I enjoy it a lot, so I thought I'd write here to get some advice. Thanks for reading:)",

I now want to explore ways to make some relatively loose curls and shine to my hair. \n\nI have literally 0 experience on maintaining. \n\nI have done a bit of research but would like a breakdown on \n\n1. Frequency i should actually wash with shampoo?(two days a week? but, do i still rinse it out?)\n\n2. Frequency i should use regular conditioner?\n\n3. Frequency i should use a deep conditioner/mask?\n\nAlso any suggestions for brands to look for or staples in the industry for Styling gels, masks, shampoos, conditioners/leave ins?\n\nIn my amazon cart i got As i am classic leave in conditioner, Maree deep conditioning hair mask with argan oil.\n\ni heard Olaplex and K18 are both incredible brands for what I'm shooting for? any suggestions on what is my better option of if there are cheaper options lol(doubt it but just curious im sure i gotta pay for the good stuff)\n\nlastly i attached a photo of my current hair I'm still growing out at the moment and maybe i don't have to worry as much until its longer? thank you all in advance!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
