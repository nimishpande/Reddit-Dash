I put on a timer to force myself to work as fast as possible I have super high density hair and the installation took an hour and 15 minutes in total. Then I proceeded to diffuse for 20 minutes, once I was done I just put my bonnet up and went to sleep, in the morning I diffused again for 20 minutes and took them out the next day. \n\nLittle tips : \n1. make sure your hair is 1000000% dry before unraveling\n\n2. Do NOT make that many flat twists if you have finer hair, you should try 4 in the back and 4 in the front if your hair is super fine and low density\n\n3. This style gave me a lot of volume, not poofy volume but defined volume, but if you're looking a flatter look, you should try doing 6 in back and 8 in the front. \n\n4. Personally damp hair works way better for me than wet hair but if the latter works better for you, then go for it, you know what's good for your hair. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Pics 3&amp;4 are the day after wash day with a half updo, so that you can see all the frizzy parts.\n\nHair type: the top layer of my hair is quite straight (2a at best, no frizz), but the hair underneath is fine, wavy, frizzy (mostly 2b, some parts 2c) High porosity I think.\n\nCurrent routine: shampoo: marrocanoil hydrating shampoo; (Leave- in) conditioner: marrocanoil or ouai curl cream (prayer hands on wet hair) Styling: chey must have protein drops, eco style argan oil gel and wella professional thermal image heat protector (on towel dry hair). Diffuse with cold air. Usually wash once a week as my hair is so dry and doesn't get greasy. No refresh routine, sleep with silk pillow and often wear protective hairstyles. According to my hairdresser, my hair is healthy.\n\nMy routine is kind of random atm, but I've tried SO products and routines and invested so much time and energy. Doesn't seem to make much of a difference how many products I use or what I do. There was a time when I only used shampoo bc I had kind of given up and it kind of looked the same?!\n\nAny ideas?

The hairdresser was not my cup of tea: as a matter of fact, she was not a huge curls fan (She got her own curls straightned). I still need to decide if I feel pretty or not... It's so annoying. I hate looking like a lovey-dovey sheep or a sort of grannie😅\n\nAlso, She noticed that I'm losing hair. Since It tends to have a'lively\" shape, I treat It kindly with my hands and little water instead of combing it. So, the reason She noticed the fall may be this...\n\nThoughts about this last point? Thanks in Advance :)\n\nPS. I use a silk pillow case when I sleep. As shampoo, I clean them with a combo shampoo/conditioner by L'Oreal (the brand Is \"Ultra Dolce\"... Yes, Greetings from Italy) and I style them with the Osis cream by Schwarzkopf.\n\nPS 2: any advice on How to keep them tidy?",

      "content": "Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question but I need help 😭 18y/o me struggled with really bad acne when I had a 14 step skincare routine and desperately tried a million different products. Gave up on everything and stopped any skincare, only washing with water morning and night and somehow it started clearing up. Now I'm 20F and it has really all disappeared except for the occasional odd pimple or hormonal acne when my period comes around... So I recently tried starting a \"proper\" skincare routine (introducing a bit more products) now that my skin has stabilised.\n\nCurrent routine in morning: \n- Cetaphil gentle cleanser\n- Organic aloe gel\n- Sunscreen if I feel like it\n\n\nRight before bed when I brush:\n- Cetaphil gentle cleanser\n- Anua heartleaf toner\n- organic aloe gel\n\nAs a homebody, that's my usual routine. The problem is that if I go out for the day, usually I get home around 8-10pm and idk whether I should wash my face with cleanser when I shower, since I sleep around 12-1am so I'd just be washing my face again within a few hours. I do occasionally wear makeup and I wipe it off with micellar wipes before I hop in the shower. Is that enough or do I have to use the cleanser in the shower too? \n\nI'm a little afraid that my skin might dry out if I wash it so often. Also, if I do cleanse it during the shower, do I leave my face naked afterwards? Or do my usual skincare, even though I'd be washing it again (and probably reapplying skincare again) when I brush up before bed?\n\nSeeking advice from everyone's routine. Tysm!\n\nEdit: mistyped my AM routine!",

      "content": "I’m a gay guy which is most of the reason I even care about this, but for some reason my skin does not take well to acne and any bump etc that ends up on my ass ends up being a scar that doesn’t go away for years. I really don’t get much acne except for this one area…. \nNeedless to say my butt looks horrible and is covered in acne scars everywhere, some chicken skin, stretch marks etc. it makes me feel really self conscious. \n\nI have been working on my body a lot this year and as I get closer to my goal, I think clearing up my skin back there would really help make me feel better about myself. I’ve been researching possible solutions and one I’ve come across is skin peel. I actually went in and talked to someone about it but I decided I wanted to wait until I was closer to my body goals before getting it done since the effects aren’t permanent and I would have to do it again. \n\nThe other option I’m thinking about is just getting laser hair removal back there. I really don’t grow any noticeable hair on my ass and probably never will so I’m fine with removing the follicles if that means I’ll never have to deal with the constant acne again. \n\nAnyone have recommendations for a long term solution to my skin issue? I’ve also tried all sorts of topical creams etc but it always irritates my skin and gives me a purge which then makes everything look even worse and the scars don’t go away. Please help lol\n",

It was still visible, but the difference was honestly crazy — so much better than when I’m home. I can’t understand why it improved so much while I was away.\n\nI had a consultation about fillers, but I was told I’m not a good candidate because I have fat pads under my eyes, or a mix of hollowing and fat pads.

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users.

My frizz level isn’t typically awful, but once in a while it increases and I feel like my hair needs a bit more moisture. My hair is pretty healthy. I could use a little trim, but otherwise don’t have many complaints. So, what do you suggest? And how often should I use it?\n\nRoutine (varies):\n\nShampoo approximately 1x per week. Every other wash I do a scalp and hair clarifying wash with Dermarest. The other washes I double wash with Redken All Soft Curls. \n\nConditioner:  (varies) Redken All Soft Curly for moisture on clarifying days bc Dermarest can be very drying. I sometimes use L’Oréal Bonding or glossing conditioner on non-clarifying days, or the Redken conditioner again. \n\nTo style: Not your Mother’s curl talk leave-in. Tresemme curly mousse, then NYM (sometimes Curl Boss) gel, followed by brush style with Bounce Curl Brush and diffuse. If I need to rewet while styling, I use water and NYM spray gel.

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "This Phase II trial randomized 180 Chinese men with androgenetic alopecia into six groups to receive topical GT20029 at 0.5% or 1.0% either once daily or twice weekly, plus matched placebo groups, for 12 weeks. \n\nThe main outcome was the change in target-area non-vellus hair count at Week 12, with additional tracking of Week 6 hair count, hair width, and the terminal-to-vellus ratio. \n\nAll four GT20029 groups increased hair count from baseline by Week 12, but the cleanest placebo-separated results were seen with 0.5% once daily and 1.0% twice weekly: the 0.5% once-daily group showed a least-squares mean change of 16.80 hairs/cm² versus 10.10 hairs/cm² for placebo, and the 1.0% twice-weekly group showed 11.94 hairs/cm² versus 4.57 hairs/cm² for placebo, translating to net advantages of about 6.70 and 7.37 hairs/cm² respectively. \n\nThe 1.0% twice-weekly schedule also produced the strongest thickness signal, improving hair width at Week 12 versus placebo (0.54 vs −0.02), and it even showed an early Week 6 hair-count separation in the repeated-measures analysis (2.93 versus −7.45). \n\nThis makes 1.0% twice weekly the most convincing overall regimen in this short study, with 0.5% once daily close behind. \n\nA reasonable critique of why the 1.0% once-daily group did not clearly outperform placebo is that this was a small, short-dose exploration trial with only about 30 people per arm, the daily-dose arms did not show a clear dose-response pattern, and separate placebo groups for daily and twice-weekly schedules can drift differently by chance. \n\nIt is also plausible that a PROTAC like GT20029 has a non-linear sweet spot so the intermittent higher exposure produces cleaner androgen receptor degradation than higher continuous dosing, and also daily use of the higher-strength formula could add subtle irritation or short-term cycling noise that blunts visible separation over just 12 weeks.\n\n24 weeks (6 months) would probably show better data that we can rely comfortably on. But so far, this is a good signal for this mechanism of action!",
