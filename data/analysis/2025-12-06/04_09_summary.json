      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I’ve been using the Dot &amp; Key Vitamin C + SPF 50 sunscreen for a month straight. I bought it after seeing all the ads and I regretted it for a sec much since everyone bashed it but honestly, here is my hot take based just on my experience: \n\nPros: Leaves no white cast on my face. I layer it with a Serum, Moisturizer and then sunscreen but it hardly feels oily (maybe cuz I have dull skin). The texture feels good on the skin and mixes well. Feels very light. I hate the feeling of being plastered when I apply sunscreen so this felt good for a change.\n\nCons: Everyone keeps saying the SPF protection is not as good. I personally didn’t feel that way, since my face didn’t get any darker. It did give it a subtle suppleness, and i am getting no unwanted tan yet either. \n\nI think i’m gonna stick with it irrespective of what i might hear, if something works for you- it works! It is what it is. \n",

      "content": "My hair never looks good on washday, and it’s super inconvenient. My curls consistently come out frizzy, flat, and dry right after washing, and they only start to look good a day or two later once they’ve had time to fluff and settle. I can tell that these curls WILL look good in a couple days. Strangely, my refresh curls, especially when I lightly steam or mist them, often look better than my curls ever do when freshly washed. My hair just doesn’t like being shampooed and needs to recuperate. \n\nToday was an example of the washday frustration. I diffused because I was in a rush and it’s cold out but the diffuser always creates frizz I never have otherwise. I used a generous amount of Curlsmith Volume Lotion on wet hair, brushed through with a Denman, lightly cupped it to form curls then diffused to about 90% dry while focusing on the roots. I used the hottest and highest setting bc I don’t have all day. Still the dryer wasn’t moving my hair around at all. Once dry, I finished with Olaplex hair oil. But despite using what should be a simple routine, my curls looked worse than when I do almost nothing.\n\nDiffusing in general seems to create frizz for me, but air-drying soaking-wet hair is really inconvenient, so I feel stuck between two bad options.\n\nHonestly, I get the best results when I just wash my hair before bed, rough blow-dry without leave-ins, sleep in my bonnet and then style my curls the next day by misting them with a spray bottle and applying product.\n",

My main concerns are:\n\n* **Large, visible pores**\n* **Dry, sometimes tight skin**\n* **Fine lines starting to appear**\n* **Dark under-eye circles/bags**\n* Overall, I just want a cleaner, smoother, healthier look\n\nRight now my routine is extremely basic:\n\n**AM/PM:**\n\n* *Bioderma Sensibio Micellar Cleansing Oil*\n* *La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser*\n* *Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream*\n\nI don’t use **any serums, toners, exfoliants, retinoids, or eye creams** yet.\n\nBecause my skin is sensitive, I’m nervous to introduce new products without knowing what I’m doing. I’d love help figuring out what to add to target dryness + large pores + early signs of aging without causing irritation.\n\nI’m looking for recommendations on:\n\n* A **sensitive-skin-friendly exfoliant** (if I even need one)\n* A gentle **retinol/retinoid** that won’t burn my face off\n* Hydrating serums (HA? peptides?)\n* Anything that helps with **under-eye darkness/bags**\n* Tips for achieving a more “clean,” hydrated, even look\n\nI’m not trying to overcomplicate my routine — just want something effective and realistic for sensitive skin.\n\nAny advice or product suggestions would be super appreciated.

      "content": "Just looking for ways to make it a little less curly and lean a little more wavy. \n\nMy normal Routine:\n\n1. Shower: Shampoo (Nizoral) + Conditioner (Shea Moisture)\n\n2. Scrunch “dry” from soaking to damp with pure cotton towel \n\n3. Apply cream and style (Pattern styling cream) \n\n4. Let it air dry naturally\n\n\nIn the first photo, my hair has a slightly more wavy texture due to not being 100% dry yet, which I happen to like. The second photo is more completely dry and as you can see, I have much tighter curls in that photo. \n\nIs there a way to consistently keep my hair a little LESS curly and stay closer to what it is in the first photo, preferably without using chemicals that would damage it? \n\nThank you! \n\nP.S. I’ve been given some advice to blow dry it to “50% dry” (don’t know how to gauge that) and then use a brush and brush it out from there. I just end up with frizz and fluff in doing that because I really don’t know what I’m doing with a blow dryer. I also tried some kind of tension method, but it only worked when I blow dried it with high heat to get it dry quickly, but I’m not sure if that’s going to damage my hair. I still had lots of frizz with that method. \n",

These are kind of painful, and beneath my skin (cystic acne?!?). My skin looks oily a lot but mostly feels normal/dry. If I skip my skincare for one night my skin gets really dry- especially around my nose (which tends to be the most oily part of my face).\n\nI’d say my skin is a bit sensitive as it gets red consistently after using some products. I used to have a full blown routine but now I just use the following:\n\nMorning- pure molecules clarifying bar Versed gel cream moisturizer\n\nNight: Pure molecules clarifying bar Curology cream moisturizer\n\nI talked to some of my friends and they said looking at my skin, they recommend I use something lightweight and hydrating. So today I went out and bought: cerave hydrating facial cleanser Good molecules hydrating gel moisturizer with electrolytes And good molecules hyaluronic acid serum\n\nIs there anything you’d change? I’ve found using less on my face does more (I don’t wear a full face of makeup).\n\nThank you!! ",

      "content": "Hello! I need tips on incorporating a retinol serum in my routine for a skin thats pretty reactive and sensitive. For the last few months I've been going through a rough patch with my skin. I used to have a pretty good skin but all of a sudden, at 29, i start dealing with huge outbreaks of closed comedones and pimples all over my cheeks. ive been using a bha toner since october and it really helps. I'm now looking to add a retinol as well to really improve my skin.\n\nhere is my current routine:\n\nAM\n\nLRP Toleriane cleanser\nLRP Toleriane sensitive cream \nLRP Athelios sunscreen \n\nPM \n\nBioderma micellar water (to remove foundation)\nLRP Toleriane cleanser\nPaulas choice BHA 2% toner (every 3 days)\nLRP Toleriane sensitive \nLRP Cicaplast Balm b5 (only a tiny bit on areas that are extremely dry, like around the nose and between brows)\n\ni was thinking on adding the CeraVe retinol serum every 4 days and cutting the BHA toner to every 4 days as well, so the routine would look like this\n\nday one: bha\nday two: no active\nday three: retinol\nday four: no active\nso on\n\nso heres my questions: \n\nis that a good plan?\n\ndo you have other retinol serums to recommend? (i dont wanna spend 100$ tho haha) \n\ni had a pretty nasty purge when i started the BHA, will the retinol give me another purge or it should be easier? \n\nthank you for reading me!! \n\n\n\n\n",

Occasionally I also put a Korean easyderm acne patch on some of the spot pimples for the daytime. I do also make sure to put on sunscreen in the morning as well.\n\nI generally have these sorts of breakouts after stressful times or with less sleep, but then even after being less stressed and starting to get more sleep, the acne takes a long while to go away and is very persistent and by the time it goes away, another small breakout pops up. I try my best to minimize stress and maximize sleep, hydrate properly, and eat a decent diet without too many processed foods or sugars. I plan to consult a dermatologist for a more personalized plan in the future, but for right now, what do you suggest would be a good AM and PM routine for my skin and what I think looks like clogged pores?",

      "content": "Hello lovely people! I’m getting married soon and could really use help from the curly community (or anyone who’s DIY’d their wedding hair).\n\nI’ve attached a photo of my natural hair for reference. \n\nI know for sure that I want to wear my hair curly, but I'd love for it to look a little bit different than it does every other day. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to find a curly hair stylist near me, so I’m hoping to DIY my looks.\n\nI’m aiming for three different styles across events:\n1) A loose, romantic bun (if it’s possible with my length)\n2) A half-up half-down style\n3) A natural curls-down look that can survive hours of dancing \n\nWhat I'm struggling with is that most tutorials I’m finding are either for much longer curls or assume I already know what I’m doing, which I do not. \n\nSo I’m looking for:\n- Beginner friendly curly hair updo tutorials (if it says twist the front sections back, I would love to know how to actually do that without looking like a mess)\n- Tips or hacks for short-to-medium curly hair\n- Products for strong hold (happy to use non-CG hairspray if needed)\n\nMy other big concern is if I use strong hold hairspray/gel for the bun or half-up style earlier, will that ruin definition for the final curls-down day? Or is there a way to reset without fully washing again?\n\nAny advice, product recs, easy step-by-step guides, or “don’t make the mistake I did” stories are very appreciated!\n\nThank you from a stressed out but determined bride-to-be ✨ \n\nRoutine: \nI wash with a generic shampoo and the Cantu shea butter conditioner a couple of times a week (endurance sports + swimming). I then use the Asbha leave in conditioner and gel when wet, scrunch with a tshirt, lightly diffuse and then allow to air dry completely. Apart from this, I use satin pillowcases protect my hair while sleeping.",

I got lowlights, toner and a haircut for $340 incl tip. And that’s on the lower end for a good salon in the area, most places had higher pricing.\nAt home the most I’ve spend was to go blonde (with Olaplex treatment extra) and that was €140.\n\nI love getting my hair done but I don’t see any way I’d spend so much every salon visit. \n\nTo my American girlies, do you all just splurge or do your hair at home? Find an at-home stylist? Or do you just don’t dye it at all? Curious about how others go about it, or have any advice.",
