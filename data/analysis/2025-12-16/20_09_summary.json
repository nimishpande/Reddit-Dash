The last few pictures are probably 1.5 years of hair growth.\n\nIf you've seen others with a similar hair type and at least shoulder length hair i'd love to see what it would look like. ",

I can no longer keep up with a normal hair routine,  Brushing my hair, applying product and diffusing all causes me too much pain now.  i had to find a better way that was easy, accessible, affordable,  and maximized the beauty i wanted.\n\ni decided to experiment and this is the routine  that created  the hair above, the hair i have wanted for literal years:\n\n dry brush and detangle (my dad helps me with this)\n\n Shampoo really well\n\n Conditioner in mid section and ends, not roots\n\n Squeeze out excess water and blot with the towel\n\n Take a curl brush with slightly damp, NOT REALLY WET, hair, brush upward against the grain of your hair from the underneath brushing up, this is done to create curl sections\n\nflip your head upside down, gently loosen your roots with your fingers so your roots are not stuck your  head, and then scrunch all the way to the root\n\nflip all your hair forward infront of your face. air dry like that, you basically have to look slightly down till its dry.\n\nonce fully dry flip upside down, fluff the roots, then spread your fingers wide, slip your fingers in the mid section of your hair, and shake. do not brush out  the curls with your hands, just shake.\n\nflip right side up, fiddle with it for i minute, fluff where you need to, and your done.\n\ni know this wont work for everyone, for some this will dry out your hair too much, but i did everything the beauty industry tells you not to do with curly hair and my hair has literally never looked better. i don't  care if this is somehow unhealthy for my hair, im simply too disabled to do more effort than this. maybe if it gets dry I'll do a night with coconut  oil to rehydrate, but this is my routine  forever  now.\n\n I wasted so many years thinking there was something wrong with me or my hair or that the way I wanted my hair wanted to look was not possible,and it was just lies. the thing that was making my hair look bad was product. my hair has always been hypersensitive  to product, even a half dollar size of mouse weighs down my hair. with nothing my hair is so soft, light, and fluffy. i have the volume i want, the definition, everything.  And I do not care if I was possibly using the wrong product and different product would help my hair more,  Like I've said I'm too disabled for a 5 step product routine these days. this routine  is what I've  needed. its perfect.\n\n Maybe you don't need 5 different $30 hair products, maybe  the issue isn't  the wrong product, its product at all. maybe with no product  but the right styling  method, you can have what you want ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯. maybe try going no product and air drying, then slowly incorporate each product to better understand your hair, idk. \n\ngood luck to all others on your curl journey. im very happy i finally  figured  this out. oh also please do not give me any advice, im content with what im doing! &lt;3 i just wanted to share this success in hopes it can help others.",

      "content": "hello! i am 22 years old, AFAB, and heres my journey in writing!\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: just because my routine worked for me, doesn’t mean itll work for everyone, please see a dermatologist if possible!\n\n\nso you might be wondering what i mean by “problematic skin”, but to put it short, i have terrible genes that are not in my favor, i have struggled with rosacea, sensitive skin, plaque psoriasis, PCOS, dry skin, hormonal acne, blackheads, medical issues, profound stress, and more.\n\n\nmy first step: CUT THE STRESS. some people say that their beauty secret was leaving their toxic environment, and i believe them. growing up i went through severe abuse, neglect, homelessness, etc. i managed to move out of my environment by a stroke of luck and have made a recovery, i have noticed my skin improve exponentially now that i have the strength to take care of myself, live in a hygienic place, and access to things i didn’t have before. this step in particular really helped with my acne and psoriasis!\n\n\nmy second step: GOING TO A DERM. while he didn’t really help me with my face (i have bodily skin issues the most), he did prescribe me spironolactone for my PCOS and hormonal acne, and it did make a difference! one i wasnt prepared for though was the change from oily/combination skin to dry skin. luckily the dermatologist i went to has little skin product mini samples in their office, i took some to take home and experiment with, being a complete amateur and unknowledgeable about skincare at the time. i tried each one, some of them burned and in my confusion i researched it and realized i had sensitive skin.\n\n\nmy third step: BEING GENTLE. so, now that i realize my skin is sensitive, what do i do? well, i need to cut the harsh products out of my routine, including makeup wipes and scented products. welp… that narrowed my variety down quite a bit. i felt kind of hopeless at this point, realizing i have to tip toe around each product i buy, i decided to ONLY buy things specifically made with sensitive skin in mind just to save time and money. also, important note to self, dont drag towels across your face, dont try and buff out the bumps and texture, dont pick your acne, or treat removing makeup like ripping your face off. be kind to your skin, dont treat it like youre trying to remove a stain, treat it like glass. just trust the process. like girl seriously its fine lol.\n\n\nmy fourth step: FINDING A CLEANSER. so, i started doing makeup around the same time i tried to figure out skincare, they kind of went hand in hand, i started out with vanicream for a long time but realized its just okay, it made my skin dry out and was difficult to remove makeup with. after some trial and errors and about a year later into experimenting with different cleansers i finally stumbled into my first cleansing balm, the instant makeup melting cleansing balm by good molecules! and now i refuse to use anything else. it’s gentle, milky, hydrating, non irritating, absolutely 0 scent, and it takes my makeup off with ease. it was an absolute score.\n\n\nmy fifth step: TREATING THE REDNESS. so this one had me stumped for the longest time because, how the hell am i supposed to treat this one on my own? well i started doing some research and ingredients to look out for and started looking for products with said ingredients and just trying them out. i also avoided anything that might flare up my rosacea, like no sun protection, dryness, irritation, etc. well, let me just be honest, most the products i got for rosacea or to reduce redness didnt do shit for me lol. except- for these two! the chlorophyll discoloration serum by cocokind and dr. jarts cicapair soothing color correcting treatment with spf 30. i swear up and down these were so worth the money. they changed my skin the MOST, so lets break it down! i apply the cocokind (cold) after cleansing, it soothes my skin and makes it smooth, poreless, and silky. then dr jart comes in afterwards, it ACTUALLY reduces my redness, soothes my skin, protects my skin with spf, moisturizes, makes my skin glowy, and even can prime my skin for makeup! after that i like to take any which one of my lip balms to make sure my lips are nice and smooth and im done!\n\n\nmy routine simplified: gently cleanse with the instant makeup melting cleansing balm by good molecules, wash off with cold water, gently pat my face dry with a clean towel, gently apply the chlorophyll discoloration serum by cocokind (while its cold), then gently apply dr. jarts cicapair soothing color correcting treatment, then apply any kind of hydrating lip product i can reach for and boom! im done :)\n\n\nthank you all so much for taking the time to read! i have never been happier with my skin than i am now!",

I am currently dealing with a receding hairline at the temples and I use topical Minoxidil (5%) twice daily to treat it.\nMy main issues are:\nMy hair tends to be dry and frizzy, especially at the ends.\nI don't know how to style my hair to define the curls without making the thinning areas look obvious.\nMy current routine is: Kerabit's biotin and collagen shampoo(3 times a week), I currently don't use any conditioner because am confused whether it would cause more hairloss and whether or not it should be used while being on monoxidil.After the shampoo and even a normal bath i towel try my hair everyday and apply minoxidil,I use it morning and at night before sleeping, no idea about what sleep protection meant in the rules.\nI'm looking for advice on:\nA basic routine to add moisture back into my hair without weighing it down.\nHow to layer styling products (like gel or cream) with Minoxidil application. Do I apply Minoxidil before or after styling?\nAny styling techniques that help wavy hair look fuller on top\nI just wanna make sure they look clean , healthy and not this bad at least .\nPlease drop any suggestion you have as it would only help me know more about my hair and styling.",

I want more volume and definition if possible. \n\nThis is Day 1 hair, freshly washed and diffused. \n\nI have wavy hair, but still haven’t found the best routine or products that work for me. I tend to have oily scalp even when I only wash every few days, especially now that I workout regularly. \n\nWhat has worked best for definition so far has been bleaching my hair. Not sure why, but maybe damaging it helped with the texture? \n\nRoutine:\n\nRight now I use Garnier Fructis leave in conditioner and Curl Smith Hydrostyle Flexi Jelly. I either then air dry or diffuse on warm with my hair upside down, and I add a bit of oil for frizz and heat to my shaft and ends. Shampoo and conditioner is Redken Color Extend Magnetics. \n\nCurrent method for sleeping I am trying out is using a silk/satin scarf for a makeshift bonnet. This stays in for a few hours at night but by the time I wake up it’s fallen off. ",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I never had skin issues until this year (28F).\n\nThe timeline of the skin issues really was from March-August of this year. The worst of it was May-July 2025. As shown in the second pic, my skin was CLEAR in Feb 2025. I never had acne issues growing up and only ever had breakouts if I was really stressed, but it was never a monthslong issue.\n\nI believe what really helped me was 15% Azelaic Acid and Aklief (a retinoid), which I was prescribed both at the end of July. It was August/September that I really saw progress and healing. Up to that point, I was on antibiotics for months (doxycycline and minocycline - neither helped) and my face was dry, irritated, felt like it was always burning and just uncomfortable. Literally no idea why my skin broke out like that and was a problem majority of the year, but I am very thankful the topicals helped.\n\nJust wanted to share since I was on here nonstop looking for someone who had similar issues for advice and similar stories for hope and whatnot.\n\nMy routine now focuses on dealing with the hyperpigmentation and scarring left behind from the months of breakouts and inflammation, but very happy with the results!!",

      "title": "Post-Op Curls Split Town",
      "content": "So lots of people have posted and commiserated in the past but I find myself feeling sort of... lost and am just open to fresh ideas. I know this sounds dramatic, but I'm mourning part of my identity. \n\nI underwent surgery last week and my body is still healing. I could not shower for 4 days post-op and when I finally did, I used a clarifying shampoo (tresemee pro-pure) because eww hospital and bed sweat smell. \n\nI don't normally wash my hair very often, but I have *never* had something like this happen before! My waves and curls just packed up and left town. I went from all over waves on my lengthier hair and tight ringlets framing my face to just... totally straight hair with a little bit of frizz at the bottom and a tiny hint of kink at the tendrils. A bobbi pin fell out of my hair last night! It just slid right out. 💀 \n\nI understand hair patterns can change after major life events... but I wasn't expecting the 12+ inches of already grown and dead hair to simply change *overnight*. This can't be permanent. I am struggling to accept it on top of everything else.. \n\nMy daily routine for over a year has  been a soak in the bathtub with a nice deep scalp massage, then I gently rinse and apply a simple leave-in conditioner (dermasil brand). I wrap it in an old t-shirt and plop with a very light-weight hair gel for about 20 minutes while getting dressed. \n\nAfter dressing, I diffuse with no heat for about 5-10 minutes, and then shape it with large bamboo \"combetter\" hair pick when it needs shaping. This has been working for me, for like, ever. If my hair gets build-up or acts \"off\" for any reason, I wash it and start over... but honestly it generally needs very minimal washing and I almost never brush it. \n\nI can't submerge myself in the tub yet- I had surgery on my reproductive parts and maybe hormones are at play here too... but I did the whole scalp massage before washing it under lukewarm water and again during the wash with warm, but not hot water. I rinsed with cooler water and put the dermasil leave-in on it before wrapping. I felt so good after! I followed the rest of my routine with the same brand gel, and diffused on low with no heat using my beloved black onyx diffuser and... well I will include a picture. The first is from today, and the others are from a couple of weeks ago, when I was still feeling good. \n\nContext: I did not brush my hair before taking today's picture. There were no curl clumps forming while diffusing and it just feels really slippery and stringy in general. Not slippery in a bad way but it is kind of sleek and just... straight. I tried spraying it with water yesterday to get some texture and volume and it just.. does this again. Ugh. I don't know what to even do with it!\n\nMy cousin is a hairdresser and I'll get her to take off that dead frizz stuff at the bottom for me. Do you guys think that will help? Should I have her cut it more like straight hair now? He has been giving me curly cuts for years and I've never even seen anyone else... Anyone have their curls revive after a life event a few days/weeks later? Success stories would also be super helpful! ",

I have combination skin . I used to have much more acne but it cleared up a lot. For reference , the first 3 pictures are from yesterday, and the last 3 are from today. Today, I only washed my face in the morning with cold water \n\nI also have some darkness under my eyes I think it’s more under-eye dark circles rather than actual eye bags . They aren’t severe, but i do notice small dots and some visible veins in that area \n\nI eat pretty clean with minimal processed food i barely eat that stuff , recently added more fruit , drink about 2-3L of water daily, and i change my pillowcases every other 2-3 days . Its also cold in my region right now , so i dont go outside much because it concerns me that the sun is damaging my skin. \n\nI currently don’t have a skincare routine . In the past , I used Cetaphil Daily Cleanser and a Cetaphil moisturizer for normal to dry skin ( didn’t realize at the time ) . The cleanser seems to work, but it doesnt foam much and absorbs in a minute. I also tried a simple vitamin c serum from AOA and noticed some improvement , but stopped because i got no clue what im doing its been 1-2  months now. About 2 years ago , Using Cetaphil Daily Cleanser along with a homemade moisturizing mask ( Aloe vera gel mixed with honey and Vaseline )  cleared my skin but my skin texture was not this bad ",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

I'm hoping for a lotion to help with this (and maybe one that I can also use on my feet, my heels are starting to get a ridge of callous thanks to my flat feet and the way I stand, but my hands are a priority)\n\nI don't want one that leaves a greasy residue, but any of the ones I've found that *don't* leave a thick, vaseline-y layer always just end up wicking away like I've rubbed my hands with water and they don't even seem to make any change. I can't find a nice in-between that actually works.\n\nI'd also really like if it's not some big name expensive brand where you're paying extra for the name or packaging regardless of if it's a good product. And ideally it comes in a bigger size as well instead of a 2 ounce sample size that I'll run out of in a week.\n\nI don't really have much money to spend on something that isn't a necessity these days, but if the product is really that good I might be willing to go higher just to have some relief.\n\nMy skin typically burns when I apply most lotions this time of year for some reason because the cracking gets so bad, it ends up looking like I've got a rash after I rub it in from the irritation, so if anyone knows the reason why that happens and has tips or products to help alleviate it, I'd really appreciate it.",
