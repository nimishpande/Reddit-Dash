      "title": "Curly Cut - Why no product?",
      "content": "Hi, I am wondering why hair stylists who do dry curly cuts require you to come in with no product? My hair is completely different with and without product. Without product, it is a giant ball of frizz. There are no individual curls. With product, I have clearly defined curls. I have never gone outside of my house with no product on my hair and I'm scared to. I've had curly cuts before but I didn't know you weren't supposed to put in product. Now my stylist is telling me I have to come in without product and I would love to hear why, so that I feel reassured that it will come out well. I looked it up online and it said it's so they can see how each individual curls falls, but without product, I have no curls. Just frizz. I'm worried they will not cut my hair in the way I normally wear it.  Photo of how I usually style my hair. Thanks!\n\nRoutine:\n\nWash with Dove Intensive Shampoo\nCondition with John Frieda Ultra Volume\nIn shower, apply Not Your Mother's Curl Gel\nOutside shower, apply AG re:coil and scrunch\nChi Heat protecting spray \nDiffuse \nSleep with a silk bonnet, never towel dry, rather brush with a Denman\n\nAnd if anyone has further advice to get rid of the frizz, I'm all ears 😁 Thank you!",

I can no longer keep up with a normal hair routine,  Brushing my hair, applying product and diffusing all causes me too much pain now.  i had to find a better way that was easy, accessible, affordable,  and maximized the beauty i wanted.\n\ni decided to experiment and this is the routine  that created  the hair above, the hair i have wanted for literal years:\n\n dry brush and detangle (my dad helps me with this)\n\n Shampoo really well\n\n Conditioner in mid section and ends, not roots\n\n Squeeze out excess water and blot with the towel\n\n Take a curl brush with slightly damp, NOT REALLY WET, hair, brush upward against the grain of your hair from the underneath brushing up, this is done to create curl sections\n\nflip your head upside down, gently loosen your roots with your fingers so your roots are not stuck your  head, and then scrunch all the way to the root\n\nflip all your hair forward infront of your face. air dry like that, you basically have to look slightly down till its dry.\n\nonce fully dry flip upside down, fluff the roots, then spread your fingers wide, slip your fingers in the mid section of your hair, and shake. do not brush out  the curls with your hands, just shake.\n\nflip right side up, fiddle with it for i minute, fluff where you need to, and your done.\n\ni know this wont work for everyone, for some this will dry out your hair too much, but i did everything the beauty industry tells you not to do with curly hair and my hair has literally never looked better. i don't  care if this is somehow unhealthy for my hair, im simply too disabled to do more effort than this. maybe if it gets dry I'll do a night with coconut  oil to rehydrate, but this is my routine  forever  now.\n\n I wasted so many years thinking there was something wrong with me or my hair or that the way I wanted my hair wanted to look was not possible,and it was just lies. the thing that was making my hair look bad was product. my hair has always been hypersensitive  to product, even a half dollar size of mouse weighs down my hair. with nothing my hair is so soft, light, and fluffy. i have the volume i want, the definition, everything.  And I do not care if I was possibly using the wrong product and different product would help my hair more,  Like I've said I'm too disabled for a 5 step product routine these days. this routine  is what I've  needed. its perfect.\n\n Maybe you don't need 5 different $30 hair products, maybe  the issue isn't  the wrong product, its product at all. maybe with no product  but the right styling  method, you can have what you want ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯. maybe try going no product and air drying, then slowly incorporate each product to better understand your hair, idk. \n\ngood luck to all others on your curl journey. im very happy i finally  figured  this out. oh also please do not give me any advice, im content with what im doing! &lt;3 i just wanted to share this success in hopes it can help others.",

Do I apply Minoxidil before or after styling?\nAny styling techniques that help wavy hair look fuller on top\nI just wanna make sure they look clean , healthy and not this bad at least .\nPlease drop any suggestion you have as it would only help me know more about my hair and styling.",

I usually have 1 or two days of no issues, but then when the hair starts to grow back it wrecks havoc!

      "content": "I get pretty gnarly dry skin during winter months and I've yet to find a hand lotion that I'm satisfied with, so I'm looking for some recommendations\n\nThe backs of my hands get very prickly and dry during winter and at the worst they straight up just crack and split. I'm hoping for a lotion to help with this (and maybe one that I can also use on my feet, my heels are starting to get a ridge of callous thanks to my flat feet and the way I stand, but my hands are a priority)\n\nI don't want one that leaves a greasy residue, but any of the ones I've found that *don't* leave a thick, vaseline-y layer always just end up wicking away like I've rubbed my hands with water and they don't even seem to make any change. I can't find a nice in-between that actually works.\n\nI'd also really like if it's not some big name expensive brand where you're paying extra for the name or packaging regardless of if it's a good product. And ideally it comes in a bigger size as well instead of a 2 ounce sample size that I'll run out of in a week.\n\nI don't really have much money to spend on something that isn't a necessity these days, but if the product is really that good I might be willing to go higher just to have some relief.\n\nMy skin typically burns when I apply most lotions this time of year for some reason because the cracking gets so bad, it ends up looking like I've got a rash after I rub it in from the irritation, so if anyone knows the reason why that happens and has tips or products to help alleviate it, I'd really appreciate it.",

I have combination skin - dry (eczema) and oily in the T zone. \n\nDue to eczema I use a very minimal skincare routine. Simple micellar water for removal and aveeno cleanser. I then immediately follow with avene cicalfate (only thing that helps my eczema) and L’Oréal revitalise filler serum. I also place on beauty of joseon retinal under my eyes for the wrinkles shown in one of the pictures. It’s not helped so far though. \n\nMy mum has bought me the Anua heartleaf cleanser for my Christmas but I haven’t used this yet.\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations? I looked into PRP but didn’t realise this was £1000 for 3 sessions!! I’m 28 and also scared to start botox too early - but would this work? Would take supplements etc too. Looking for something not too expensive.\n\nThanks all :)\n\n",

      "content": "So lots of people have posted and commiserated in the past but I find myself feeling sort of... lost and am just open to fresh ideas. I know this sounds dramatic, but I'm mourning part of my identity. \n\nI underwent surgery last week and my body is still healing. I could not shower for 4 days post-op and when I finally did, I used a clarifying shampoo (tresemee pro-pure) because eww hospital and bed sweat smell. \n\nI don't normally wash my hair very often, but I have *never* had something like this happen before! My waves and curls just packed up and left town. I went from all over waves on my lengthier hair and tight ringlets framing my face to just... totally straight hair with a little bit of frizz at the bottom and a tiny hint of kink at the tendrils. A bobbi pin fell out of my hair last night! It just slid right out. 💀 \n\nI understand hair patterns can change after major life events... but I wasn't expecting the 12+ inches of already grown and dead hair to simply change *overnight*. This can't be permanent. I am struggling to accept it on top of everything else.. \n\nMy daily routine for over a year has  been a soak in the bathtub with a nice deep scalp massage, then I gently rinse and apply a simple leave-in conditioner (dermasil brand). I wrap it in an old t-shirt and plop with a very light-weight hair gel for about 20 minutes while getting dressed. \n\nAfter dressing, I diffuse with no heat for about 5-10 minutes, and then shape it with large bamboo \"combetter\" hair pick when it needs shaping. This has been working for me, for like, ever. If my hair gets build-up or acts \"off\" for any reason, I wash it and start over... but honestly it generally needs very minimal washing and I almost never brush it. \n\nI can't submerge myself in the tub yet- I had surgery on my reproductive parts and maybe hormones are at play here too... but I did the whole scalp massage before washing it under lukewarm water and again during the wash with warm, but not hot water. I rinsed with cooler water and put the dermasil leave-in on it before wrapping. I felt so good after! I followed the rest of my routine with the same brand gel, and diffused on low with no heat using my beloved black onyx diffuser and... well I will include a picture. The first is from today, and the others are from a couple of weeks ago, when I was still feeling good. \n\nContext: I did not brush my hair before taking today's picture. There were no curl clumps forming while diffusing and it just feels really slippery and stringy in general. Not slippery in a bad way but it is kind of sleek and just... straight. I tried spraying it with water yesterday to get some texture and volume and it just.. does this again. Ugh. I don't know what to even do with it!\n\nMy cousin is a hairdresser and I'll get her to take off that dead frizz stuff at the bottom for me. Do you guys think that will help? Should I have her cut it more like straight hair now? He has been giving me curly cuts for years and I've never even seen anyone else... Anyone have their curls revive after a life event a few days/weeks later? Success stories would also be super helpful! ",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
