The first photo is how they cut my hair the first time I saw them since I was growing out my pixie and realized I have naturally wavy hair. This was 2 years ago and I’ve since grew my hair out well below my shoulders. Looking back at pictures with my short hair, I really missed that era and went to cut my hair with them again. I showed them the reference and explained exactly how I want it to look but (third picture) this is what my hair looks like right now after trying to somewhat decently style it. The fourth photo is immediately after the haircut. I just don’t know what went wrong or what I should do… I realize my hair probably has to grow out before I do anything else with it but how do I go from this to the voluminous, wavy hair in the first and second photos? Any advice will be greatly appreciated 🙏\n\nMy usual styling routine are the Odele volumizing shampoo and conditioner, then the Twist by Ouidad lightweight styling gel and a styling foam. I usually diffuse my hair but it looked horrible with this haircut so I ended up straightening it. ",

      "title": "My hair is turning into dreadlocks against my will, help!",
      "content": "There you go...\nI've always had lots of different hairstyles; I've always loved my hair and doing different things with it.\n\nThe first time I cut my hair short and shaved one side, I was 12 years old, and it lasted at least 10 years with the shaving and other haircuts.\nIn 2022, I shaved my head (the first time was in 2018).\nThis year I stopped everything; it's all grown out naturally, except I have no idea how to take care of long hair. This summer I did everything wrong; it was always tied up. I can't get it to reach my ears; I don't know how to take care of it properly.\nAnd now we have huge knots several centimeters long that are naturally creating dreadlocks. I'm in a vicious cycle; it's getting worse every day, and I'm afraid it will continue.\nI don't know what to do. I don't have the energy to keep changing my hairstyle; I don't want to anymore... so I have three options.\n\n1) Simple, quick, effective: I cut it. Just the tangled strands so I can get a proper haircut in January without feeling self-conscious (I want a short bob with a longer strand in the back for a braid; I can't cut it properly if it's like this).\n\n2) I'm continuing with the dreadlocks I've already started. I'm adding more strands, doing it carefully to manage the tangles and the self-consciousness (I've already had them done; I learned them when I was younger, along with other hairstyles...). However, I'm European and Caucasian. I've had dreadlocks in the past; they were beautiful, but now I know about cultural appropriation and the history behind dreadlocks, so I don't want to be disrespectful by wearing them. (Here too, I'm taking into account opinions and historical and hair knowledge. I don't want to offend or appropriate things I shouldn't.

In the shower I use Pantene pro-v repair and protect shampoo. Once that’s washed out I use Monday curl define conditioner, and I brush it through my hair with a wet brush. I let it sit while I soap/shave and washing it out is the last thing I do before I get out of the shower. \n\n2. I dry it with a microfiber towel until it’s just damp, then I use Jamaican black castor oil leave in conditioner from the body shop. I get a blueberry/grape sized glob, rub it on my fingers, and then do my best to spread it through my hair without running my fingers through it to mess up the curls. \n\n3. Once it’s all spread through I scrunch my hair up with my hands for a bit, and then I let it air dry. I don’t brush or comb my hair unless I’m in the shower with conditioner in it. \n\n4. I typically only use the leave in conditioner when I’m planning on going out somewhere, but I get frizz whether or not I use it. I’d really love to see my hair with more defined curls, especially at the top of my head, with less of the frizz of course!! Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ",

I have dozens of these in my hair. A few times a week I sit down to search for these in my hair, and cut them off. I am worried it will start to make a difference in the length of my hair. I would love to avoid having to cut my hair like this. Does anyone have ANY tips on how to prevent these tiny single-strand knots? Is it OK if I just leave them there, and don't cut them off?? Because I would be down to do that, if there isn't a problem with it. it's SO FRUSTRATING because these knots are most often near the middle of the hair strand instead of the very end. I just cant resist cutting them off!!! Here is my routine:\n\n\\* 2 days a week I wash my hair, this is when I fully detangle by brushing it out with a Wet brush  \n\\* I let my hair air dry which takes several hours  \n\\* on wash day, I use two different leave in conditioners and curl cream  \n\\* every night I finger-detangle my hair (mostly) and put it into two braids  \n\\* every night I oil my hair while it is braided\n\nAs you can see, I try to minimize tangles as much as possible. But since my hair is so long, it's so hard, its practically always tangled. Please give me tips!",

      "content": "Wanted to ask a question based on a strong personal belief I’ve developed. I’ve noticed that right after ejaculation, my scalp follicles start tingling, and hair fall seems to increase. Continuous ejaculation over consecutive days appears to lead to excessive hair loss. It also seems to alleviate sebum production, acne, dandruff, excess body odor, and sweating.\n\nI’ve been trying to identify the vitamins and nutrients lost during ejaculation and have experimented with supplementing them—mainly zinc, magnesium, amino acids, etc. I’ve also noticed that cardio and exercise help me recover more quickly from the post-ejaculatory phase.\n\nMy question is: Has there been any study on what happens in the male body immediately after ejaculation?\n\nAdditionally, hair loss has historically been a male-specific issue, and it is mostly men who lose semen/energy during reproduction, whereas women do not. Also relevant is sexual dimorphism—men tend to have more body hair, and perhaps cannot “afford” to maintain scalp hair, as it is anatomically expensive. Hair loss also appears more prevalent in Caucasian men, who generally have higher body hair density compared to many Asian populations.\n\nSorry for the rant.\n",
