I think I do a pretty great job However, I still go get pedicures. I think I can do a great job at home but it does hurt my back 😅. \n\nI just feel like no matter where I go, the pedicures I get are such a disappointment. Am I a perfectionist? Not exactly, but I would hope you’d do a better job than me. \n\nEvery single time: \n- Cold water\n- Cut, scraped, or pinched\n- Polish on my cuticles\n- Constantly fixing the paint job after the fact\n\nI’m always polite and tip well. $10 for a $50 pedi. I never say anything about this stuff. But like - come on? I hate shelling out my hard earned bucks for such a consistently awful experience. \n\nIs it that the people can’t see? They don’t care? \n\nI’m literally currently leaving an appt with a scrape on my toe from the nail file… I think that’s the third appt in a row where I’ve left bleeding. \n\nI’m about to buy some of those magnifying glasses so I can start doing my pedis at home. \n\nAnyone else???",

Some products have heat protectant claims \"up to X degree\" on their label, while other products with the same silicones do not. Could I just use the product without those claims on the label? Is it just marketing? Are there silicones that are better heat protectants than others?",

I’ve always had issues with frizz and getting my hair to cooperate, but I feel like it’s finally time to ask for help, lol. \n\nHere is my routine: \n\n1. I wash my hair every other day. In the shower I use Pantene pro-v repair and protect shampoo. Once that’s washed out I use Monday curl define conditioner, and I brush it through my hair with a wet brush. I let it sit while I soap/shave and washing it out is the last thing I do before I get out of the shower. \n\n2. I dry it with a microfiber towel until it’s just damp, then I use Jamaican black castor oil leave in conditioner from the body shop. I get a blueberry/grape sized glob, rub it on my fingers, and then do my best to spread it through my hair without running my fingers through it to mess up the curls. \n\n3. Once it’s all spread through I scrunch my hair up with my hands for a bit, and then I let it air dry. I don’t brush or comb my hair unless I’m in the shower with conditioner in it. \n\n4. I typically only use the leave in conditioner when I’m planning on going out somewhere, but I get frizz whether or not I use it. I’d really love to see my hair with more defined curls, especially at the top of my head, with less of the frizz of course!! Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ",

(advice on this would be great i can’t figure out what it is). have tried using selenium sulfide every other day to get rid of the suspected fungal acne. i think i have what are closed comedomes on my chin that are driving me absolutely insane.\n\nright now my routine for the last 6ish days has been qv gentle cleanser, az clear 20, then qv ceramides moisturizer morning and night. and then every other day selenium sulfide shampoo on the face. az 20 has been making my face itch all day so i’m considering replacing it with the ordinary one that is less strong. i was also planning on introducing TO nicinamide and HA serum into my routine. i’m worried the 20 percent azealic acid is too harsh given the itching. any advice on how to structure a routine using these products would really help.\n\nplease help i feel so horrible about my skin, i’ve never had it be this bad and im desperate for help figuring out what the issue is and how to fix it asap 😭",

I use parfum too so that layers over it.\n\n??But, So… what should I get for my body wash/gel/soap??\n\nReading in these Reddit threads I see some people mention Shower Gel and other products.

      "content": "I don’t know what to title this but wanted to share. I’ve been into skincare pretty steadily for about 9 years or so. I have super sensitive, dry, hormonal skin, I’m 41. So moisturizing is everything.\n\nAfter years of trying so many types of products, I had to take a step back because I couldn’t get my skin to be calm. Hydrated but just a lot of congestion and flare ups.\n\nI scaled way back to just tret, moisturizers that my skin loves, and spf. Occasionally layering other hydration but very few exfoliating products. Instead favoring extremely gentle manual exfoliation with a washcloth. I have always used aquaphor or LRP B5 baume as my occluding product.\n\nMy skin has been calm lately so I decided to just try Vaseline about 5 days ago. I figured my skin is ok with aquaphor it should be ok. And yes. Yes it was. It works soooooo much better than aquaphor!! Like a noticeable softness. I had read rave reviews but then also have tried other things with rave reviews and it went quite badly for whatever reason that my skin didn’t like it.\n\nI am so pleasantly surprised that I wanted to share for anyone else that wondered if it really was that good. Thanks for listening to my ted talk. :)\n\nThings I currently use:\n- obagi tret (0.1). I know it’s bougie but it has worked so much better than any other tret I’ve used. \n- Naturium peptide moisturizer has honestly been a dream. My skin loves this\n- Shiseido (I think) stick SPF\n- Elemis balm makeup remover \n- Panoxyl 4% benzoyl peroxide hydrating face wash \n- occasional add ons: Violette FR boum boum milk, byoma milky toner, LRP B5 Baume, hypochlorous acid \n\nDon’t mind the I’m sure many spelling errors. My skin is clear with some chin redness, but otherwise soft and I am often mistaken for much younger 🤷🏻‍♀️",

However I do notice if I wash my hair every day my hair does become oily faster.

I just want more definition and hydration (probably need a haircut too) I don’t use heat. \n\nCurrent Routine: \n\nI wash my hair every other day\n\n1: shampoo with tea tree shampoo from Paul Mitchell   (This can change since I only use because it’s my moms and I haven’t gone out to buy my own) \n\n2: conditioner with raw sugar moisture smoothie which I let sit while I shower\n\n3: on wet hair: curlsmith hydrate and plump leave in and a little bit of not your mothers hair mouse. \n\n4: sometimes a little vitamin E oil on my ends. \n\nI just bought Rizos curl defining cream and Ocoa styling gel for hopefully better definition. \n\nWhile sleeping I put my hair in a braid",

      "content": "This year I have finally mastered how to detangle and wash my hair, and since then my hair has gotten much longer and denser. It’s been over 5 years since I grew out my hair from literally 1 cm and it is now just past my waist when stretched. This routine has been optimized for fine textured, dense, 4a-c hair:\n\n1. The most important step— I detangle with african pride pre poo AND aussie miracle moist conditioner. The combination gives INCREDIBLE slip that is akin to detangling in the shower, but without wasting all that water. I finger detangle, then use the tangle teezer for fine and fragile hair, as well as the unbrush (depending on how fine textured the section of hair is). I twist my hair in 8-9 twists to prep it for washing.\n2. Im currently using Donna’s choice moisturizing shampoo and deep condition with TGIN honey miracle; both are amazing for winter haircare. I shampoo and deep condition my hair while is in twists. The trick is to twist it so that the twists are loose in the roots, but firmer in the mid shaft and ends.\n3. I towel dry and apply camille rose butter gel and chebe-infused hair grease (I literally mix a chebe pomade I found on etsy with Softee hair grease).\n\nChebe is works wonders length retention and is a ritualistic beauty practice for women in Chad.\n\nI braid my hair in a couple braids overnight, then two strand twist it (about 12-16 twists) the next night so I can have a bomb twist out. The key is to keep your hair tucked away most of the week—claw clips, twisted/braided up dos, ponytails, buns, etc. I take style inspiration from African beauty bloggers. \n\nDaily— I spray my hair with either water, Oyin juices and berries leave in, or a fenugreek and rosemary spray from etsy (Queensanity). It depends on the humidity in the air, because glycerin and dry winter air doesn’t always mix!\n\nMonthly—I do a protein treatment with Curlsmith bond repair and clarify my hair with the Strands of Faith clarifying mask. I’ve also started using Pattern clarifying shampoo, which works pretty well.\n\nQuarterly—I trim my own hair after using the Revair to stretch it. Staying out of the salon helped my length retention exponentially because these stylists have zero patience for coily hair and sky high prices. ",

I’ve noticed that right after ejaculation, my scalp follicles start tingling, and hair fall seems to increase. Continuous ejaculation over consecutive days appears to lead to excessive hair loss. It also seems to alleviate sebum production, acne, dandruff, excess body odor, and sweating.\n\nI’ve been trying to identify the vitamins and nutrients lost during ejaculation and have experimented with supplementing them—mainly zinc, magnesium, amino acids, etc. I’ve also noticed that cardio and exercise help me recover more quickly from the post-ejaculatory phase.\n\nMy question is: Has there been any study on what happens in the male body immediately after ejaculation?\n\nAdditionally, hair loss has historically been a male-specific issue, and it is mostly men who lose semen/energy during reproduction, whereas women do not. Also relevant is sexual dimorphism—men tend to have more body hair, and perhaps cannot “afford” to maintain scalp hair, as it is anatomically expensive. Hair loss also appears more prevalent in Caucasian men, who generally have higher body hair density compared to many Asian populations.\n\nSorry for the rant.\n",

I’ve been seeing a dermatologist and they recommended using a benozyl peroxide wash. I use that every day, as well as Trifarotene cream, but it just prevents it from getting worse. The acne never goes away. I have better days and worse days, but generally it looks like this. If anyone has had experience getting rid of their back acne, pleaseeee help me. I’m at my wits end.\n",

(Since it’s gotten worse in the cold)\n\nIn my normal routine I’ve used the la roche posay hydrating cleanser cerave facial moisturizer spf 50 and neutrogena on the spot treatment for about two years, and I also on and off use the peach slices snail rescue for two years.I recently got more on my butt about moisturizers, I wasn’t super consistent with my cerave spf. I also haven’t been outside more, actually spending more inside.\n\nI got the tatcha eye cream a month ago to help with dryness there, which has helped a lot. I just added the ordinary hyaluronic acid, cerave night cream, and reintroduced the peach slices snail rescue to my routine.I just noticed today that my freckles have gotten larger, none of them are new though just larger.it may have been over time but I pluck my eyebrows often and I just noticed this. \n\nMy concern is the new additions to my routine, are any of these known to do something like this? They are significantly larger. I don’t mind the way they look, however I’m concerned with the increase.\n\nCould this be a form of skin purging? I know that happens when new products are introduced, right now my pores are larger because of it, which I know is normal because it’s happened before.",
