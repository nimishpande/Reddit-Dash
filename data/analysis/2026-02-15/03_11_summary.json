The difference is astounding. I've never had legs or arms or an ass this smooth, my husband literally can't stop feeling me up and tbh neither can I. I have strawberry legs and while this routine hasn't done much for that, I am STUNNED by the way these products have completely transformed my skin.

The antibiotics didn’t appear to help, so I went to a dermatologist and the PA said she didn’t see sun damage and felt it might be allergy related.\n\nI have since changed almost every product I use (toothpaste, soap, etc) and my diet but it doesn’t seem to respond to any of these changes.\n\nAround new year I figured I might have thrush so I started using a mouthwash called IORinse and this fixed the sensation in my mouth after heavy and consistent use. In response to this I began using otc antifungal ointments and soap on my lips, but they remain persistently dry after weeks of use. Without zinc oxide my lips burn and tingle within a couple minutes.\n\nIf there are any doctors or PAs with feedback it would be greatly appreciated. I do have dermatitis that I have received ketoconazole for in the past but I haven’t used that in easily over a decade.\n\nThe zinc oxide definitely helps the symptoms and makes the condition manageable and I can deal with that, but I am concerned that this could be Erythroplakia or Actinic Cheilitis. My lips don’t feel rough to my finger but they do feel rough when to themselves (meaning when touch my lips it feels like my finger is rough though my finger is normal).\n\nI would greatly appreciate any input from medical professionals familiar with skincare.\n\nThe first 2 photos are from today2/14/2026 and the third photo is from January 2nd, while on antibiotics.",

This is the level of curl I am getting when activly trying for straight hair.\n\nI go to gym 3-4 times a week. Currently I wash my hair once a week with the Dr. For Hair Folligen Silk shampoo and Treatment. I use the UNOVE Heating Guard before I blowdry my hair. I will also use hair oil the Mise-en-scene Perfect Serum is the best ive found for my hair in terms of both mousture and reducing frizz.\nThe way I currently dry my hair is wrapping my hair in a cotton hair wrap, after that flip my head upside down dry till 90%, then flip upright section my hair and round brush straight. This is what i was taught growing up. \n\nI sleep with a silk bonnet but I move around a lot so it often slips off. I have found it useful because the hair at my neck is extremely fine compared to the rest and used to break a lot. \nOtherwise my hair is both thick in volume and the strands, to the point where I warn hairdressers, they initially dont believe me and then are making surprised remarks are the shampoo bowl. \n\nI have tried to do a curly routine before the bleach issue but I know I was doing something wrong because after sleep and gym it loses it's shape, it didn't really feel clean and was generally super frizzy. I was trying to do a hair cast thing?¿ There is noticeable shrinkage when I previously tried a curly routine, like below shoulder blade length becoming collarbone length.\n\nTLDR; Please Help! I am clueless about my hair. After decades of styling my hair straight and damging it, my hair refuses to be straight.\nWhere do i start? \nHow do i make a low effort routine?\n\nThank you for any help!!",

      "content": "Took me a while, but I think I’ve finally figured out how to make my Dyson styling actually work — especially on my curly (2C/3A) hair.\n\nThis is the exact order I follow:\n\n• On damp hair, I apply a damage-repair leave-in. Currently using the Redken ABC leave-in.\n\n• Then I layer a small amount of L’Oréal Paris Hyaluron leave-in for extra moisture and the L’Oréal Extraordinary Oil serum for smoothness and shine.\n\n• I let my hair air dry a bit before using heat. If I’m in a hurry, I rough dry slightly first.\n\nFor styling:\n\nMost days, I either use just the round brush attachment for a simple blowout, or just the paddle brush if I want it straighter and sleeker.\n\nToday, I first used the paddle brush attachment to smooth everything out and create a base. After that, I switched to the round barrel attachment for volume and a soft 90s-style blowout.\n\nI work in smaller sections — around 3 seconds on high heat, followed by 4 seconds of cool shot to set.\n\nThe most important step: hairspray after finishing each section. I used Schwarzkopf Taft Ultra. That’s what actually makes the style last without making it stiff.\n\nPeople at work have been asking if I style my hair every day, but I don’t. I do this once a week and it lasts till my next wash.\n\nSharing pictures because this might be my best Dyson day so far.",

      "content": "Hi! Ok, so I have naturally curly ringlet hair probably somewhere around 3A and 3B. I LOVE my hair and style it with a curl defining gel and a foaming moose after my showers, before I defuse my hair. Here’s my question, I want to curl my hair with a curly iron for a fancy event coming up, but it’s in between my hair wash days (I wash and restyle my hair every 3-4 days depending.) I try not to deviate from this schedule too much and like to keep my hair dry if I’m not explicitly washing and restyling it. If I already have my styling products in my hair for a few days, is it ok to curl my hair with heat, or will this dry my hair? Let me know if this question doesn’t make sense haha. I don’t curl my hair often since I love my natural curls, so I’m not sure what’s safe or not for my hair. I DO NOT want to damage my natural curls too much (I know that curling them with heat will hurt them a little, but I wanna make sure I don’t fry them to the point of no return yk?) Any advice will be appreciated! 🙏🙏 add ons about my routine in case it’s important: I have a silk pillowcase, I pineapple my hair to sleep, and I switch between inersense hydrating shampoo and conditioner and deva curl’s low-poo conditioner",

I couldn’t find any way to stop it, until I first started incorperating silicones, and now the last 2 months finally found the perfect products for my hair.\n\nIf anyone is from Germany, I can truly recommend these products:\n\nBalea Ultra Sensitive Shampoo\n\nBalea Tiefenreinigung (Deep Cleansing) Shampoo\n\nGuhl Feuchtigkeitskur (Moisture Mask) - this is my FAVORITE!!! No silicones, and uses lactic acid to quickly get absorbed into the hair (30secs)\n\nRedken Ultra Soft Conditioner - the only product I use that has silicones. Creates a nice barrier so that my hair doesn’t instantly lose all the moisture from the Guhl mask. But not too heavy and the silicones are water soluble which prevents buildup\n\nAfter shower: Isana Leave in Conditioner (Argan Oil). No silicones, lots of moisture. I spray it directly into my ends.\n\nTo prevent all moisture from leaving: Alverde Hair Oil Repair &amp; Care (no silicones, doesn’t dry out my hair, and is not expensive).\n\nWhat I’ve learned: Expensive “Hair Oils” such as Olaplex and Kerastase are not for me. This was a change I made just a few weeks ago and had the biggest impact: I realized it dried out my hair all this time! ",

      "content": "Historically I’ve always had really thin weak nails that break and tear easily. I don’t need them super long, just long enough to paint with gel polish as that’s the only thing that will stay on my nails (gel usually lasts \\~a week, regular polish starts flaking off after a day). I’ve been doing a new regimen for a few weeks now and while my nails are definitely stronger and growing a bit longer than they normally would, now they’re peeling, which has never happened before. Not sure what’s going on or how to correct it.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n\\- vitamins: centrum multi, vitamin d3, magnesium glycinate\n\n\\- drinking water w electrolytes\n\n\\- no polish other than sheer products made for protecting nails (Essie to the rescue or modelones nail foundation)\n\n\\- switched to a glass nail file\n\n\\- keratin infused cuticle oil nightly (seche condition)\n\n\\- using lotion on hands frequently through the day\n\nIs there anything else I should be doing? How can I treat the peeling? Any help would be super appreciated 🖤",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",
