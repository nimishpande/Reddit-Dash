I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

Even though I’ll get 5 compliments a day about it at work, they refuse to believe it and tell me that people probably make fun of me. Obviously I don’t agree with them, but I feel like both myself and them would be happier if I found a different way to take care of my curls or a different length layout to make it look a little more styled, as well as stopping some of their comments. Longer bangs are non negotiable, and I also don’t want any fades or tapers because I’m so bored with getting those over and over again. I just want something that can keep some length on the sides and back, while also feeling a bit more tidy or clean. I’ve tried looking all over Google, but nothing really seemed like it would suit me or my head shape. Any ideas?\n\nCurrently, my routine is using a nizoral shampoo and frizz ease conditioner, as well as a Bb curl cream for after I shower. I gently dry with a towel but mainly rely on air drying.",

      "content": "[PART 2] of comparing Indian version of skincare products with its foreign counterparts. \n\nToday I tried to compare Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra Indian variant with its USA counterpart. \n\nFrom the first screenshot we can conclude that the USA variant is silicone free and has \"more,\" exactly 5, ingredients which creates \"hydration\" for the skin and has 2 \"less\" ingredients which may cause \"oily skin\".\n\nNow from the second screenshot, the major differences are:\n\nThe Texture:\n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses Silicones (Cyclopentasiloxane and Cyclohexasiloxane). These give the cream a silky, smooth feel that disappears quickly into the skin. It feels more like a velvety finish. \n \nThe Right Side (USA): They swaps these silicones for Natural Plant Oils (Brassica Campestris Seed Oil and Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil). This makes it feel much richer and greasier. It doesn't evaporate quickly, it stays on the surface longer to physically nourish the skin. Which may make it bad for our Indian skin, due to humid climate. \n\nThe Seal: \n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid. These are fatty acids that create a thick, physical seal on top of your skin. It’s designed to waterproof your skin so moisture can't escape.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and Sodium Citrate. Instead of just sealing the surface, it focuses on soothing irritation and providing antioxidant protection.\n\nThe Emulsifiers:\n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses more traditional, synthetic emulsifiers (PEG-100 Stearate, Steareth-21). These are very stable and give the product a long shelf life and consistent texture.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Cetearyl Glucoside, It is generally considered more skin-friendly for people with extremely sensitive or eczema-prone skin because it mimics the skin's natural structure.\n\nThis concludes this comparison between two variants of Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra between two different regions. \n\nTo my research a few people claiming that we, here in India, get inferior products as compared to the foreign counterparts, I think it's not inferior at all, it's just made/formulate in such a way that it supports our skins that too in a very humid climate, just like we have here in India as compared to cold weather in any western country!!!\n\nLet me know what you guys think. \n\nP.S. I'm not a dermat, so I cannot fully differentiate between the ingredients list all by myself, so I used Google and Gemini to help me sort things out. If there's any mistake I'd love know in the comments section! ",

My skin tone also looks uneven, and my pores are quite visible on the cheeks.\nI don’t get a lot of active acne anymore, but these leftover marks and texture bother me the most.\n\nMy Current routine is this-\nCleanser- angel facewash by connote(suggested by a dermat previously)\nMoisturizer- cerave \nSunscreen - hyphen \nOccasional exfoliation with a scrub.\nI use azaelic acid 20% and tretinoin on alternative nights. I have been using it since a month and a half but inconsistently. \n\nI’m looking for advice on what can I do to improve this ?  What ingredients actually help with stubborn marks like these?

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I am 22.\n\nNext to a few sheds (just noticed more hair falling when showering) I have not noticed anything substantial. I started taking topical minoxidil almost 2 years ago and moved to oral minoxidil exactly one year ago today. Since starting minoxidil, I’ve only seen transparent baby hairs that grow to 1-1.5 cm. They get pulled out very easily as well when pulled on a bit.\n\nI am not asking what I should do, but rather, I am asking for other people’s experiences like mine. Has anyone switched from finasteride to dutasteride after only seeing useless baby hairs after multiple cycles? If so, did switching to dutasteride help grow these? I know people say wait 2 years, but studies have shown the vast majority of users seeing their results within 6-12 months.\n\nAnyone that was on the same boat?",

My skin isn't oily, so the pimples I see aren't acne.\n\nI don't know what to use. I also have rosacea, and my cheeks and nose burn in the heat, but I can't treat any of my skin problems because every time I apply something, it disappears, and it's like I haven't applied anything at all, since my skin doesn't retain anything.\n\nI've been like this for years. Right now, I'm using CeraVe's 5% Urea Intensive Cream because I read that urea is good for dehydration and it has silicones to lock in moisture. I've been thinking about buying a polyglutamic acid or beta-glucan serum, and I've also read that glycerin is good, but the problem is I don't know how to make my skin retain it. I've also tried slugging with Vaseline, but I wake up with sticky skin, and when I have to wash it in the morning, it's back to the same thing: tightness and dryness.",
