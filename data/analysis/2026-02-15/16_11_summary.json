Even though I’ll get 5 compliments a day about it at work, they refuse to believe it and tell me that people probably make fun of me. Obviously I don’t agree with them, but I feel like both myself and them would be happier if I found a different way to take care of my curls or a different length layout to make it look a little more styled, as well as stopping some of their comments. Longer bangs are non negotiable, and I also don’t want any fades or tapers because I’m so bored with getting those over and over again. I just want something that can keep some length on the sides and back, while also feeling a bit more tidy or clean. I’ve tried looking all over Google, but nothing really seemed like it would suit me or my head shape. Any ideas?\n\nCurrently, my routine is using a nizoral shampoo and frizz ease conditioner, as well as a Bb curl cream for after I shower. I gently dry with a towel but mainly rely on air drying.",

These give the cream a silky, smooth feel that disappears quickly into the skin. It feels more like a velvety finish. \n \nThe Right Side (USA): They swaps these silicones for Natural Plant Oils (Brassica Campestris Seed Oil and Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil). This makes it feel much richer and greasier. It doesn't evaporate quickly, it stays on the surface longer to physically nourish the skin. Which may make it bad for our Indian skin, due to humid climate. \n\nThe Seal: \n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid. These are fatty acids that create a thick, physical seal on top of your skin. It’s designed to waterproof your skin so moisture can't escape.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and Sodium Citrate. Instead of just sealing the surface, it focuses on soothing irritation and providing antioxidant protection.\n\nThe Emulsifiers:\n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses more traditional, synthetic emulsifiers (PEG-100 Stearate, Steareth-21). These are very stable and give the product a long shelf life and consistent texture.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Cetearyl Glucoside, It is generally considered more skin-friendly for people with extremely sensitive or eczema-prone skin because it mimics the skin's natural structure.\n\nThis concludes this comparison between two variants of Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra between two different regions. \n\nTo my research a few people claiming that we, here in India, get inferior products as compared to the foreign counterparts, I think it's not inferior at all, it's just made/formulate in such a way that it supports our skins that too in a very humid climate, just like we have here in India as compared to cold weather in any western country!!!\n\nLet me know what you guys think. \n\nP.S. I'm not a dermat, so I cannot fully differentiate between the ingredients list all by myself, so I used Google and Gemini to help me sort things out. If there's any mistake I'd love know in the comments section! ",

      "content": "hi! i’ve been wondering for around a year or two now if my hair is curly or not, but i’m really uninformed about how to care for curly hair or how to find out if i have curly hair or not, and also what kind of products i need for a curly haircare routine. so i kinda just ignored this whole thing and kept caring for my hair as if it’s not curly. \n\nhowever it’s always very puffy and frizzy when it’s freshly washed, and it has no shape which annoys me a lot because i don’t want to heat style it and damage it to look good. i’ve been sleeping in a silk bonnet for a while now which always helps with the frizziness and puffiness i get after drying my freshly washed hair.\n\ni included pictures (1st and 2nd pic) on how my hair looks whenever it rains or there’s a lot of humidity in the air; it kinda gets curls. which i thought could be an indicator of it being curly, but again i’m really new to the topic so i’m not sure. this forming of curls also happens a few days after my wash day (3rd pic).\n\na really good friend of mine has curly hair and once she did her curly hair care routine on my hair to see if it would hold and it did hold, however i felt like it kind of weighed my hair down and made the curls a bit crunchy when they dried. \n\ni’m not sure if that’s because we have different hair types (contrary to her, i have a lot of hair but the strands are pretty thin, hers is really thick. \n\ni also think i have high porosity hair (my hair absorbs water and hair products really quickly, it dries fast, i have frizz and my ends are dry and dull but my scalp gets oily after 3 days.) while she has low porosity so her products might not have worked for me as effectively but i included a picture of those results too (4th and 5th pic).\n\na bit of a summary of my hair and the products i use:\n\n\\- oily scalp, dull, dry ends\n\n\\- (probably) high porosity hair\n\n\\- puffy and frizzy when freshly washed and blow dried\n\n\\- lot of hair but thin strands\n\n\\~ shampoo: ECOFORIA Aqua Moist Shampoo\n\n\\~ conditioner: ECOFORIA Aqua Moist Conditioner\n\n\\~ hair mask (once a week): GARNIER Cocoa Butter Hair Food\n\n\\~ frizz control (doesn’t feel like it helps LMAO): CLIMAPLEX Anti-frizz Protector Cream\n\n\\~ hair oil: KÉRASTASE Elixir Ultime l’Huile Originale (planning on switching this up for a cruelty free alternative because i’m in the midst of switching to cruelty free beauty products)\n\nsooo yeah based on what i wrote and the pictures, does anyone have any ideas on what might be the case? and i would love to get product recommendations (cruelty free if possible) !! \n\ni’m open to literally every information HAHA. i live in Europe if that helps to see what kind of products i can buy around here.\n\nif you have any more questions, i’ll do my best to answer them! thank you if you made it this far 💗\n\n \n\np.s.: english is not my first language so let me know if anything i wrote is unclear and needs further clarification! 💗💗💗",

Acne, blackheads, skin barrier is so bad to the point that I barely can find anything to put on my face (cream, cleanser, literally anything) without it feeling like my face is burning, sometimes my skin is dry, sometimes oily, and I don't even know what creams to buy for that.\n\nI was mostly using creams/cleansers for oily type skin cuz of acne and I think THAT ruined my skin barrier. I recently started to hydrate my skin as much as I can, but I see that my blackheads are starting to appear more. I don't even know anymore guys. I only know that when I use Dove gentle soap bar, it's okey, my skin is not burning, and when i use Nivea's basic cream, my face is also not burning, but I feel like my blackheads are appearing more.\n\nCan someone please recommend me the most sensitive and gentle creams and cleansers that you know are working good for damaged skin barrier/sensitive skin? It has to be really really gentle, because I don't know what to do anymore...",

I am 22.\n\nNext to a few sheds (just noticed more hair falling when showering) I have not noticed anything substantial. I started taking topical minoxidil almost 2 years ago and moved to oral minoxidil exactly one year ago today. Since starting minoxidil, I’ve only seen transparent baby hairs that grow to 1-1.5 cm. They get pulled out very easily as well when pulled on a bit.\n\nI am not asking what I should do, but rather, I am asking for other people’s experiences like mine. Has anyone switched from finasteride to dutasteride after only seeing useless baby hairs after multiple cycles? If so, did switching to dutasteride help grow these? I know people say wait 2 years, but studies have shown the vast majority of users seeing their results within 6-12 months.\n\nAnyone that was on the same boat?",

Im into the gym and used to eat 6-8 a day wondering why I was so bloated and my acne was getting worse despite me having a clean whole food diet. It has something to do with the Albumin in the egg Once I cut eggs out completely my inflammation and redness significantly reduced within a week.\n\nAnother huge part was when I switched to disposable face towels instead of using my regular towel to dry my face. My acne became less inflamed and I was getting less breakouts.\n\nYour towel is insanely dirty and has so much bacteria.\n\nI quit using relentless skincare products I thought were helping me but weren't. I used to have a multiple step routine with different creams and serums. All this did was kill my skin barrier and take my money. Now I'm the morning | just rinse with cold water, use a hydrating serum, and spf. At night l double cleanse with non toxic gentle cleansers and follow up with a hydrating serum and lotion.\n\nOther small things that helped\n\n\\- Switching to silk pillowcases and changing them twice a week.\n\n\\- Drinking plenty of water\n\n\\- Changing bedsheets and towel once a week",

My skin tone also looks uneven, and my pores are quite visible on the cheeks.\nI don’t get a lot of active acne anymore, but these leftover marks and texture bother me the most.\n\nMy Current routine is this-\nCleanser- angel facewash by connote(suggested by a dermat previously)\nMoisturizer- cerave \nSunscreen - hyphen \nOccasional exfoliation with a scrub.\nI use azaelic acid 20% and tretinoin on alternative nights. I have been using it since a month and a half but inconsistently. \n\nI’m looking for advice on what can I do to improve this ?  What ingredients actually help with stubborn marks like these?

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I think my skin is dehydrated because the water evaporates, and I suspect my skin barrier is broken, since I keep getting pimples, but I don't have any irritation, burning, or itching. My skin isn't oily, so the pimples I see aren't acne.\n\nI don't know what to use. I also have rosacea, and my cheeks and nose burn in the heat, but I can't treat any of my skin problems because every time I apply something, it disappears, and it's like I haven't applied anything at all, since my skin doesn't retain anything.\n\nI've been like this for years. Right now, I'm using CeraVe's 5% Urea Intensive Cream because I read that urea is good for dehydration and it has silicones to lock in moisture. I've been thinking about buying a polyglutamic acid or beta-glucan serum, and I've also read that glycerin is good, but the problem is I don't know how to make my skin retain it. I've also tried slugging with Vaseline, but I wake up with sticky skin, and when I have to wash it in the morning, it's back to the same thing: tightness and dryness.",
