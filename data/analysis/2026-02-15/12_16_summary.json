I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

Longer bangs are non negotiable, and I also don’t want any fades or tapers because I’m so bored with getting those over and over again. I just want something that can keep some length on the sides and back, while also feeling a bit more tidy or clean. I’ve tried looking all over Google, but nothing really seemed like it would suit me or my head shape. Any ideas?\n\nCurrently, my routine is using a nizoral shampoo and frizz ease conditioner, as well as a Bb curl cream for after I shower. I gently dry with a towel but mainly rely on air drying.",

Microneedling - effective when combined with topical min, not much evidence as a standalone treatment \n\n3. LLLT - studies show some efficacy, but I found it useless\n\n4. PRP and exosomes - again some efficacy but anecdotal results say they are useless\n\n5. Latanoprost - not very strong for scalp hair growth but pathway is promising \n\n6. Copper peptides (ghkcu) - some people claim it thickens hair follicles \n\nUpcoming treatments:\n\n1. PP405 - the most promising among all upcoming growth agonists\n\n2. Vdphl01 - slow release oral minoxidil allowing people to take up to 17 mg oral min daily \n\n3. ET-02 - targets stem cell pathways but research is early stage \n\nAm I missing anything? \n\n ",

I have been using it since a month and a half but inconsistently. \n\nI’m looking for advice on what can I do to improve this ?  What ingredients actually help with stubborn marks like these?

      "title": "Comparing Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra India vs USA variant",
      "content": "[PART 2] of comparing Indian version of skincare products with its foreign counterparts. \n\nToday I tried to compare Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra Indian variant with its USA counterpart. \n\nFrom the first screenshot we can conclude that the USA variant is silicone free and has \"more,\" exactly 5, ingredients which creates \"hydration\" for the skin and has 2 \"less\" ingredients which may cause \"oily skin\".\n\nNow from the second screenshot, the major differences are:\n\nThe Texture:\n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses Silicones (Cyclopentasiloxane and Cyclohexasiloxane). These give the cream a silky, smooth feel that disappears quickly into the skin. It feels more like a velvety finish. \n \nThe Right Side (USA): They swaps these silicones for Natural Plant Oils (Brassica Campestris Seed Oil and Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil). This makes it feel much richer and greasier. It doesn't evaporate quickly, it stays on the surface longer to physically nourish the skin. Which may make it bad for our Indian skin, due to humid climate. \n\nThe Seal: \n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid. These are fatty acids that create a thick, physical seal on top of your skin. It’s designed to waterproof your skin so moisture can't escape.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and Sodium Citrate. Instead of just sealing the surface, it focuses on soothing irritation and providing antioxidant protection.\n\nThe Emulsifiers:\n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses more traditional, synthetic emulsifiers (PEG-100 Stearate, Steareth-21). These are very stable and give the product a long shelf life and consistent texture.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Cetearyl Glucoside, It is generally considered more skin-friendly for people with extremely sensitive or eczema-prone skin because it mimics the skin's natural structure.\n\nThis concludes this comparison between two variants of Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra between two different regions. \n\nTo my research a few people claiming that we, here in India, get inferior products as compared to the foreign counterparts, I think it's not inferior at all, it's just made/formulate in such a way that it supports our skins that too in a very humid climate, just like we have here in India as compared to cold weather in any western country!!!\n\nLet me know what you guys think. \n\nP.S. I'm not a dermat, so I cannot fully differentiate between the ingredients list all by myself, so I used Google and Gemini to help me sort things out. If there's any mistake I'd love know in the comments section! ",

I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening?

I have used olaplex hair oil for a while but don’t like it even tho I tried, im now wondering if the new Kérastase Gloss Absolu hair oil could be a good and long lasting product? My hair is mostly in ”perfect” condition and I wish to keep it that way. But I need new hair oil and new shampoo and conditioner. My hair is dyed so I have used Kérastase’s shampoo and conditioner for dyed (Chroma Absolu) hair and will keep using if I don’t find something better and more long lasting. What products do you guys suggest? Same with hair masks, I use the Kérastase Chroma Absolu and would love to have something that lasts longer. Price doesn’t matter, I don’t mind spending money for my hair. And im also open to try drug store products if they are good and have good ingredients! 😄\n\nAnd for the love of God, please give me a suggestion of a good hair brush that doesn’t rip your hair. Im tired of the Tangle Teezer I have 😂 I need some that’s more gentle that works with long, straight and thick hair, so I’d appreciate if you guys could help! Thank you in advance 🩵",

Any advice/tips on a low effort routine? Or help to figure out my curl tupe so i have a starting place? Does hair get curlier with age? \nI'm wearing my hair in an almost permanent bun because i have no idea how to style it. 🫠\n\nI bleached the sh*t out of my hair a few years ago and while I was trying to focus on repairing my hair and scalp health my previously thought wavy-ish hair is growing back in a defiant spiral/ringlet pattern, that is refusing to be or stay straight. My baby hairs are like springs sticking out from my head. The slightest moisture in the air and the hair body developes really loose sprial waves and the baby hairs are ringlets again. \n\n**the photo is from a wash day, after wrapping my hair, bowdrying upside down then sectioning. This is the level of curl I am getting when activly trying for straight hair.\n\nI go to gym 3-4 times a week. Currently I wash my hair once a week with the Dr. For Hair Folligen Silk shampoo and Treatment. I use the UNOVE Heating Guard before I blowdry my hair. I will also use hair oil the Mise-en-scene Perfect Serum is the best ive found for my hair in terms of both mousture and reducing frizz.\nThe way I currently dry my hair is wrapping my hair in a cotton hair wrap, after that flip my head upside down dry till 90%, then flip upright section my hair and round brush straight. This is what i was taught growing up. \n\nI sleep with a silk bonnet but I move around a lot so it often slips off. I have found it useful because the hair at my neck is extremely fine compared to the rest and used to break a lot. \nOtherwise my hair is both thick in volume and the strands, to the point where I warn hairdressers, they initially dont believe me and then are making surprised remarks are the shampoo bowl. \n\nI have tried to do a curly routine before the bleach issue but I know I was doing something wrong because after sleep and gym it loses it's shape, it didn't really feel clean and was generally super frizzy. I was trying to do a hair cast thing?¿ There is noticeable shrinkage when I previously tried a curly routine, like below shoulder blade length becoming collarbone length.\n\nTLDR; Please Help! I am clueless about my hair. After decades of styling my hair straight and damging it, my hair refuses to be straight.\nWhere do i start? \nHow do i make a low effort routine?\n\nThank you for any help!!",

My last stylist really botched my hair and was kind of inexperienced.\n\nNew stylist came highly recommended, however, when she styled my hair curly for the first time I was kind of in shock. It didn't seem like she had any idea of what to do? She towel-dried my hair kind of rough and then added product and sent me on my way. No attempt to maintain curl clumps or provide definition. I'd spoken with her prior about past experiences and the salon assured me this is their most experienced person and they're comfortable with different textures.\n\nDedicated curly stylists charge upwards of $500 in my area and I haven't had a good experiences with them either! \n\nI've been avoiding haircuts until I find someone I trust. What red flags / green flags do you look for? I definitely check reviews but that's kind of all I've got. \n\nHair is thick wavy curly, low porosity.\nRoutine: \nSection and rake through:\nLeDoux foam on wet hair followed by Camille Rose curl maker.\nPrayer hands.\nDiffuse.",
