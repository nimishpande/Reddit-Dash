      "content": "In October I read an article in the New York Times Wirecutter about the benefits of retinol serums. Wirecutter tested and recommended several brands. Because I am 35F and have worked outdoors for 15 years, I am starting to show some signs of damage, so I decided to try one of the mid-priced recommended brands. \n\nThe first time I used it, my whole face basically peeled off. Big patches of dry flakes that took a week of gentle washcloth exfoliation to eliminate. I had applied it at night before bed on clean, dry skin. I did some reading and started trying the \"sandwich\" method using Cetaphil moisturizer - moisturize, wait, retinol, wait, moisturize - and only using the serum about every 7-10 days. Still, the same thing keeps happening and I feel like my skin is in an eternal state of flakiness now. No broken skin or rash, just crazy flaky. I do use an SPF daily moisturizer as well.\n\nA coworker told me they only use retinol when they know it's going to be cloudy for multiple days. Is this true? If this part of my skincare routine involves long-range weather forecasting, I don't think it's for me. Or is it possible it's just not the right fit for my skin type? I don't usually have excessively dry skin (prior to using this product) and where I live, winter is actually the most humid time of year. I also consulted this Reddit's page on retinoids and while it had great information, it didn't seem like dandruff-face was a major concern. ",

      "content": "I have been experiencing painfully dry lips and dry mouth for nearly 4 months, I have seen 2 doctors and dentist and none of them seemed too concerned.\n\nThis discomfort started in early November with so visible issues just dry mouth and lips, so I figured it was just dehydration, but after 2 weeks I began using chapstick in case it was related to dry whether.\n\nEventually around Christmas my lips began weeping and bleeding so I went to the urgent care and received some antibiotics. The antibiotics didn’t appear to help, so I went to a dermatologist and the PA said she didn’t see sun damage and felt it might be allergy related.\n\nI have since changed almost every product I use (toothpaste, soap, etc) and my diet but it doesn’t seem to respond to any of these changes.\n\nAround new year I figured I might have thrush so I started using a mouthwash called IORinse and this fixed the sensation in my mouth after heavy and consistent use. In response to this I began using otc antifungal ointments and soap on my lips, but they remain persistently dry after weeks of use. Without zinc oxide my lips burn and tingle within a couple minutes.\n\nIf there are any doctors or PAs with feedback it would be greatly appreciated. I do have dermatitis that I have received ketoconazole for in the past but I haven’t used that in easily over a decade.\n\nThe zinc oxide definitely helps the symptoms and makes the condition manageable and I can deal with that, but I am concerned that this could be Erythroplakia or Actinic Cheilitis. My lips don’t feel rough to my finger but they do feel rough when to themselves (meaning when touch my lips it feels like my finger is rough though my finger is normal).\n\nI would greatly appreciate any input from medical professionals familiar with skincare.\n\nThe first 2 photos are from today2/14/2026 and the third photo is from January 2nd, while on antibiotics.",

      "content": "Took me a while, but I think I’ve finally figured out how to make my Dyson styling actually work — especially on my curly (2C/3A) hair.\n\nThis is the exact order I follow:\n\n• On damp hair, I apply a damage-repair leave-in. Currently using the Redken ABC leave-in.\n\n• Then I layer a small amount of L’Oréal Paris Hyaluron leave-in for extra moisture and the L’Oréal Extraordinary Oil serum for smoothness and shine.\n\n• I let my hair air dry a bit before using heat. If I’m in a hurry, I rough dry slightly first.\n\nFor styling:\n\nMost days, I either use just the round brush attachment for a simple blowout, or just the paddle brush if I want it straighter and sleeker.\n\nToday, I first used the paddle brush attachment to smooth everything out and create a base. After that, I switched to the round barrel attachment for volume and a soft 90s-style blowout.\n\nI work in smaller sections — around 3 seconds on high heat, followed by 4 seconds of cool shot to set.\n\nThe most important step: hairspray after finishing each section. I used Schwarzkopf Taft Ultra. That’s what actually makes the style last without making it stiff.\n\nPeople at work have been asking if I style my hair every day, but I don’t. I do this once a week and it lasts till my next wash.\n\nSharing pictures because this might be my best Dyson day so far.",

Now I wear zero makeup and don't do much for skin care. I wash and moisturize my face everyday, or even every other day. My skin is relatively glowy, I do have breakouts every so often. Though my main concern is persistent closed comedones and some blackheads/SF, though the blackheads/SF are not very severe. I know as for my cc's they must partially be due to genetics because my mom had them even into her 30s, though she didn't really practice skin care much.

I couldn’t find any way to stop it, until I first started incorperating silicones, and now the last 2 months finally found the perfect products for my hair.\n\nIf anyone is from Germany, I can truly recommend these products:\n\nBalea Ultra Sensitive Shampoo\n\nBalea Tiefenreinigung (Deep Cleansing) Shampoo\n\nGuhl Feuchtigkeitskur (Moisture Mask) - this is my FAVORITE!!! No silicones, and uses lactic acid to quickly get absorbed into the hair (30secs)\n\nRedken Ultra Soft Conditioner - the only product I use that has silicones. Creates a nice barrier so that my hair doesn’t instantly lose all the moisture from the Guhl mask. But not too heavy and the silicones are water soluble which prevents buildup\n\nAfter shower: Isana Leave in Conditioner (Argan Oil). No silicones, lots of moisture. I spray it directly into my ends.\n\nTo prevent all moisture from leaving: Alverde Hair Oil Repair &amp; Care (no silicones, doesn’t dry out my hair, and is not expensive).\n\nWhat I’ve learned: Expensive “Hair Oils” such as Olaplex and Kerastase are not for me. This was a change I made just a few weeks ago and had the biggest impact: I realized it dried out my hair all this time! ",

      "content": "I recently started letting my natural hair grow instead of straighening it. I had been straightening it for about 7-8 years and only a few months ago decided that i want to go natural. I practically shaved my head off and now only have 2-3 inches of growth.\n\nI live in Japan so its a bit harder to get products for curly hair. I think i have a good routine but i still have no idea what im doing. Whenever i look up videos to help they are all of girls with long curls and i cant do the stuff that they do yet.\n\nBecause of this I often leave the house with a lot of frizz, at first i was just so happy to finally have my natural hair I thought my frizz was cute and natural but many of my friends or people say stuff like\n\n“define it!”\n\n“It looks goofy when its frizzy-“\n\n“you dont know how to take care of your hair do you?”\n\n“You should use gels.”\n\nAnd because im a beginner i dont wanna just ignore them but they all have straight hair with little to no experience with hair like mine and often times it just feels like criticism without actual advice. It makes me irrationably angry sometimes.\n\nIve seen many people talk about frizz and i know that its normal and i see posts with girls with long curly hair with comments like\n\n“Love the normalization of frizz!”\n\nBut my hair isnt long. Its really short. I dont know if im allowed to have frizz.\n\nThis isnt a post asking for advice to get rid of frizz i just wanna know if you guys deal with this too. Do people often comment about your hair? Try to subtly touch your hair? Try to tell you how to fix it when you didnt even ask? Am i going to have to get used to these things?\n\nOf course any tips on taking care of hair is MORE than welcome too tho!\n\nMy routine..(if you can even call it a routine) 3b-3c\n\n1. Wash twice (dove shampoo intense repair)\n2. Rake Leave in through curls. (African pride olive miracle from amazon)\n3. Rake coil sculpting custard and finger curls some parts of the head (Mielle pomegranate and honey custard)\n4. Put bonnet on and sleep\n5. Wake up and shake my head a bit to loosen curls.\n\nPLEASE help. Anything. Tips on haircare, how to deal with people touching, if frizz is unhealthy, funny stories with your curls, im just so lost right now.",

While I know 25 isn’t “old” by any means, I’d like to start with prevention since I have no plans to get any kind of Botox or filler as I age. My approach is very “age gracefully but do what I can,” lol. Here’s my routine right now: \n\nMorning: \n\nCleanse with water based cleanser \n\nVitamin C serum\n\nMoisturize \n\nSPF\n\nNight:\n\nCleanse with cleansing balm to remove makeup\n\nCleanse with water based cleanser \n\nRetinol 0.1% every other evening (I’ve worked my way up to this, my skin tolerates it very well) \n\nMoisturize \n\nLike I said, very simple. I’m on a budget so most of these products are drugstore brands. Good molecules, Neutrogena, and vanicream are some of my go-to. I have combination skin, which is new for me because before pregnancy I was always really oily but now I have some dryness around my nose and mouth. My t zone is still on the oily side though. I also struggle with skin congestion on my forehead and nose. Is there anything you would recommend adding? Any critiques? Thanks in advance! ",

I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening?
