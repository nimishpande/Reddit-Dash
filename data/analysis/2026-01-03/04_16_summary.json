With it now being January and my hair not having reverted, I figured I was stuck. I used to hair straighter/maybe a bit wavy hair, amd no one else living in my family had this hair(My maternal aunt did, but she passed as a teenager, unfortunately, long before I was born) and no one knows how to care for it. I am doing my best after neglecting my new curls.\n\nI have not acquired a 'Routine' yet, as I have not proper done research and have not done been very responsible. I know I have damaged by hair. I use a regular hair brush, but my mom suggested using a wide comb(she is slowly doing research with me) so I will be picking one up. My hair is also very, very thick; very long. My hair also likes to frizz. It also does not like to sit in generic hair ties very well. It was always a nightmare, now it's worse.\n\n I do not have a refresh routine, I air dry my hair, I do not style with any products, and I do not \"protect my hair while I sleep\". I also do not dye, bleach, straighten or curl my hair. I do not part my hair. These are all things I really have to do some research into and care for. It's all very... overwhelming, almost.\n\nI use OGX for Shampoo and I alternate between Bond Repair Repair &amp; Protect, and their Clarifying Strength+ Refresh and Clarify; I am a woman, and I have cycle, during that cycle I use both some days because my hair gets really greasy and oily[very ucky]. I don't use too much conditioner, but the brand is also OGX and it's something like Repair &amp; strengthen. OGX cleans my hair best. I seldom use conditioner, as everything I've tried makes me hair frizz worse. Which sucks big time.\n\nI picked up Shea Moisture-- Kalhari Melon Oil-- Curl Stretch Refersher spray on an impulse at Walmart. Not smart, I know, but I decided earlier that day that I wasn't going to fight my curls/wavy-curls--?-- any longer and that I was going to embrace them. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips? Brand recommendations? Hair care? Anything at all? I'll gladly take any advice or suggestions you have.",

I never dealt with this prior but it seems this new hair growth is baby hair like or coming in curly making it look frizzy and an absolute wild animal to try and tame. These pictures were after-  \n\nRoutine-\n1. Shampooing with Monday smooth for frizz/curly hair and conditioning with it’s a 10 miracle deep conditioner plus keratin.  \n2. Applying sachiko frizz cream while wet &amp; combing out hair with a wide tooth comb.   \n3. I then wrapped around heatless overnight curls, still wet.  \n4. I use silk pillow cases. It’s just as bad without the overnight curls and worse if I blow dry it.  \n\nCould it be a diet/nutrient thing? Am I totally off base with products?  ",

My skin is, however, pretty dry and sensitive. I’ve had eczema since a child. As a child it was on my cheeks and in adulthood it’s flared under my nose. When I got pregnant 4 years ago, my eczema went away (yay!). Now I’m stuck with this peeling terrible nose and nothing helps!!! It is not itchy and only red when I rip it off.\n\nExfoliating looks great in the moment! But it’s peeling in the morning. I’m talking I can peel off strips of skin like every day, only on my nose.\n\nI don’t use any retinol or serums on my nose. Only moisturizers and sunscreen. Weather has no influence. Water intake has no influence.\n\nThe photo I’m attaching is what my nose always looks like (the red is from peeling off a layer that was too thick). Please help me!!!!!!",

      "content": "I’m going on a ski trip in a couple of months with my partner and a few of our friends and I’m trying to think of ways to speed up my hair routine so that the others aren’t waiting around for me. My partner asked the other day why I tend to take longer than other people to get ready and it’s got me worrying about how to keep up a presentable look while not wasting other people’s time.\n\nI’m a curly girl who also straightens my hair sometimes using the Shark FlexFusion. Both of my routines for curly or straight take a little while (straightening takes a bit longer though, about 30/40 mins with the wet to dry straightening function) but generally if I have curly hair I need to wash and reset it each day as the hair is so fine that the curls don’t hold in a ‘presentable’ way overnight. With straight hair I can usually get away with it for a couple of days without washing but the issue is it takes time to style it and the FlexFusion is noisy so using it for a long time in an apartment around other people would 100% be annoying. The other girls going on the trip have hair that is easier to manage so their ‘get ready’ routine is less complicated.\n\nI want to look presentable as we will be doing aprés ski, and tbh just because I care about looking put together as I don’t feel confident or myself if I don’t. I can’t see my curls not getting messed up with the headgear so I’ve thought about getting a temporary straightening treatment but I’m worried about it ruining the curls.. would really appreciate any other thoughts or advice",

Then my skin looked back to normal for a week or two.\n\nI knew my skin barrier was damaged so I got the Krave Beauty Great Barrier Relief and had a really bad reaction. I went to a dermatologist and they recommended i simplify my routine, so I’ve been using the face wash and moisturizer pictured for just over a month now but still my skin will “burn” randomly and get inflamed then drys out and I get what looks like fungal acne all other my chin and forehead.\n\nOn Tuesday, I washed my face and when I went to put the moisturizer on and my chin area started burning slightly (but the moistest has never really done this before). Again my skin got inflamed and then 12 hours later my skin felt dry and I had a ton of pimples all over my chin and my forehead was inflamed as well even thought it didn’t burn and didn’t have as many pimples as my chin.\n\nI am at a loss, I’m scheduled to see an allergist in a few weeks as referred to by my derm but this has been going on for over two months now and I don’t know what to do 😭\n\nAny advice??\n\n(I don’t think it’s anything hormonal since I have an IUD and don’t get a period)",

Comes with LEDs and you can adjust the focus.\n\n**What's the point? Any benefit?**\n\nI was able to finally have a more accurate calculation of my current hair density.\n\nI have diffuse thinning and appear to be a Norwood 5 but turns out the active follicular count isn't too different in balding areas vs donor.\n\nThe main difference is the thickness of the hair and how many hairs I have per follicle.\n\nThe sides and back are much thicker strands and often come in groups of 2-3, whereas the thinning (mid/front scalp) are much thinner and often host a single hair.\n\nBoth areas have at least 50 units/cm2 which is typically good enough to have good cosmetic coverage (my sides and back look pretty normal imo).\n\nThis makes me more optimistic about my current treatment. Hopefully, the dutasteride will keep suppressing the DHT and the minoxidil will increase the diameter and grow more hairs per follicle.\n\nIt can be useful for you to verify your current situation — whether the follicles are even alive still — and adjust your expectations accordingly.\n\n  \n**How to calculate density**\n\n1. Adjusted the focus of the microscope so it showed the follicles on my head.\n2. Drew a dot on my hand and measured its diameter using a ruler (approximately 3 mm).\n3. Took a picture of the dot on my hand with the microscope (see last pic)\n4. On the computer, created a box around the dot to measure its size in pixels.\n5. Divided the width and length of the full picture (in pixels) by the dot measurements (from previous step).\n6. Multiplied the two results by the dot’s area, measured in square units (3 mm²), to obtain the area captured by the sensor (0.5 cm²).\n7. Count how many individual openings (follicles) appear in pictures taken in different areas of the scalp.\n\n  \nI think it's a good enough methodology. I kinda rushed the process but have stayed on the conservative side of estimates. Will probably re-do at some point just to be sure.",
