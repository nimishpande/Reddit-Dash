Do you all not experience bedhead? No flattening in the back or side? \n\n  \nEverytime I wake up, unless I drench my hair in water and conditioner, it's going to look frizzy and misshapen. Even afterwards its still frizzy in the back.\n\nRoutine is shampoo once a week for my dry scalp, switching between repairing and protein conditioner every other shower and using leave in with deep conditioner once a week, using gel then air drying. And yes, I use a silk bonnet to sleep. \n\n  \nEven with all that the back of my hair especially will still end up looking a little frizzy with the least amount of curling. Maybe its because my hair is still short.​",

      "content": "Hey reddit! Looking for some advice on this crazy curl pattern change. Over the last two years, my curl pattern has gone from the beautiful texture you see on the first slide to the flat, sad pattern in the second, and I’m so lost trying to figure out why. I didn’t change my routine until after the change had occurred, stayed with the same amazing curly hair stylist for years, and didn’t change locations (i.e. water stayed the same). \n\nHere’s the routine I was using 2-3x per week:\n- Oribe hair alchemy shampoo (2 washes) + conditioner\n- Oribe leave-in conditioner\n- Oribe curl gloss\n- Oribe curl mousse\n- Scrunched dry with a microfiber towel, then diffused on low heat. Finished with kerastase oil and oribe anti-humidity spray. \n\nAfter I really started to get frustrated with the change, I tried:\n- Two different heat protectants for over a year, thinking maybe heat damage was the culprit\n- AG Care Renew Clarifying shampoo once per week, thinking buildup may be contributing\n- Innersense True Enlightenment scalp scrub once per month \nThese changes did not make a difference :(\n\nI have consistently used a silk pillowcase and silk bonnet to sleep, both before and after the change. \n\nI fear that, after doing some research, the culprit may be hormonal changes associated with a change in my birth control, or maybe this is just aging-associated change that I can’t control. But, before I jump to talking with my doctor about making major medical changes, does anyone have any other ideas I can try? \n\nTIA for your help and for reading, I miss my curls and really appreciate your help getting them back!!",

      "content": "The first photo is my attempt at styling, which I disliked because it felt unnatural; I dislike the crunchiness and staleness. The second photo is brushed out and unstyled. The third photo is dried and unstyled, but not yet brushed.\n\nI (f24) have very curly hair. For the whole of my whole childhood, I assumed it was just frizzy and damaged. For the majority of my adult life, I've either straightened it or tied it back to ignore the frizz, but this coming year, I really want to embrace my curly hair.\n\nThe few times I have tried curly hair routines, I've struggled with the texture of mousse and gel on my hair, as I absolutely detest it! One of the main reasons I enjoyed straightening my hair was the soft feeling it gave my hair, so please keep this in mind when recommending products &lt;3\n\nI currently use Being Bye Bye Frizz Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner, as well as Herbal Essences Bio Renew Smoothening Leave-In Cream. For the in-between steps, I am absolutely clueless!\n\nI know you're not meant to dry brush, but does this mean I should wet my hair daily to be able to brush it and detangle it? Working in a bit of a labour-intensive job, my hair is going between tied up in a crappy bun and tied back at the base of my neck several times a day to keep it out of my face.\n\nAny tips and tricks would be appreciated, if products could be from Woolworths/Coles/other Australian stores that sell beauty/pharmacy products and not break the bank, that would be amazing as well.\n\nThank you all so much! Let me know if I need to clarify anything I've said.",

However, this year I made a promise to myself that I’ll finally heal my skin and be acne free.\n\nI’ve already been using adapelene for some time and recently switched to a different brand and see a huge improvement! I’m also using very gentle cleanser, moisturiser and spf (all from Dr Sam’s - the best thing I’ve ever put on my skin!. My diet is super clean, I drink bone broth (even though I’m vegetarian) and eat high protein &amp; fibre meals. I exercise and walk minimum 10k steps.\n\nI’d be interested to know your opinion about a vibration plate. It’s been trending recently and I was wondering whether it may indirectly support skin health through lymphatic drainage and blood circulation? 🤔 I’m also a very anxious person and I realise that my skin issues could also be related to stress. Could this help?\n\nIn addition, I’ve had a Dennis Gross LED mask for several years but tbh I haven’t seen that much of a difference. I want to switch to something better/stronger. I’m looking for a panel, rather than a mask. Do you have any recommendations, especially for acne skin?\n\nI also want to buy RingConn to track my sleep, steps and overall health. This is non-negotiable for me, but I’m also wondering whether I should get all 3 or just the ring + LED or vibration plate?\n\nAny advice welcome! Thanks so much!",

Just like, ive seen alot of people call Pond's super light gel a dupe for Neutrogena's Hydro Boost, and it honestly made me wonder how much do we have to spend for hydration. \n\nAt the same time, not everything marketed for dry skin helps long term. Some products feel nice for an hour and then the tightness comes right back. super annoying. \n\nSo can y'all recommend what works for your dry skin without it being crazy expensive? Creams, gels, barrier repair stuff im open to all atp. \n\nWould love to hear whats actually made a difference, especially from fellow dry skin folks.",

Has anyone with my hair type experience with this brand? It’s important to me that the products are lightweight and at the same time moisturizing. Here are some more facts about my hair:\n\nit gets greasy fast on the roots/ sides of my head.\n\nDry from the middle to the ends and very frizzy all over.\n\nhigh porosity\n\nI wash it every other day/ every two days\n\nmy current routine is( please don’t judge, I know it’s bad hahaha): dry brushing my hair before showering, then washing with q+a curl shampoo (British brand), then conditioning with the q+a curl conditioner (both contain heavy coconut and Shea butter ingredients). I dry my hair in a normal towel and then I style it upside down and scrunch it with my hands with the cantu leave- in conditioner, the Yari Curl activator and the Yari curl maker gel. I blow dry my hair with a diffuser. I do have a bonnet but I often forget to put it in at night. I do not have a refresh routine. I’m open to any haircare recommendations! \n\nps.

Because of that, I stop using it. After 2–3 weeks, once my skin calms down, I try it again… and the same thing happens.\n\nThese aren’t small bumps. They’re big, painful pimples that take weeks to go away.\n\nI initially thought this might be purging, maybe because of azelaic acid or some other active in it, but I’m confused now because:\n\n\t•\tI’m not using it regularly (only once, then I stop)\n\n\t•\tIt’s been 3 months and the reaction is the same every time\n\n\t•\tThe pimples stop when I don’t use it\n\nMy routine is very simple:\n\n\t•\tChemist at Play face wash\n\n\t•\tSometimes Garnier Neem Face Wash (this actually helps reduce my pimples)\n\n\t•\tIn winter, I occasionally use Nivea cream (the white one) and that does NOT break me out\n\n\t•\tNo other actives, no serums, nothing else new\n\nSo this Foxtail moisturizer is literally the only different factor that causes these breakouts.\n\nAbout my skin:\n\n\t•\tI’m 25\n\n\t•\tOily skin in summers\n\n\t•\tNormal to dry in winters\n\n\t•\tI don’t use moisturizer daily — only when my skin feels dry\n\n\t•\tHonestly, when I just stick to face wash, my skin seems fine, like it has enough oil on its own\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tIs this actually purging, or is my skin just reacting badly to this product?\n\n\t•\tIf I start using it regularly, will my skin “get used to it” and stop breaking out?\n\n\t•\tOr should I just stop using it completely?\n\nBecause right now, this is not fun anymore and the pimples are painful 😭\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone who’s experienced something similar.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

I put on my bonnet while a tad bit damp. \n\nI tend to struggle with frizziness. Especially in the back of my hair. More in a specific spot it’s frizzy and doesn’t like to curl up like the rest. I feel my hair looks dull without any product when it’s dry. \n\nGoal: Healthy, hydrated/moisturized hair, Shiny, long hair\n\nAny advice?",
