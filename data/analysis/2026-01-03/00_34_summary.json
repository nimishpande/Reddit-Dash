Diffuse upside down scrunch hair to the scalp for extra volume.\n\nI’m on the fence about serums and gels still. I feel like my hair isn’t as soft when I use them and the style has to be reset every day so what’s the point? I kind of like just letting my hair be really soft, and letting it do its thing until wash day.

I've been on a course of accutane that worked for 3 months before the acne returned, although not as severe as it used to be.\n\nI have spent the past 2 years alternating between tretinoin &amp; now differin. Both have seen some success, yet the breakouts are still persistent and are affecting my self confidence. I'm wondering if they either aren't strong enough or I'm not seeing their full benefit due to a damaged skin barrier?\n\nMy face feels dry and tight even after the water hits it in the shower. Yet it also appears oily throughout the day. Around my nose and my cheeks are the worst. The simple act of massaging cleanser into my face turns my skin red. Acne breakouts are very common &amp; even worse the area around the breakouts turns bright red permanently? I'm now on the third day of stopping all actives &amp; sticking to a basic skincare routine.\n\n* **AM**\n* Rinse with water\n* Haruharu black rice toner\n* Purito unscented centella serum\n* Purito bamboo moisturiser\n* Beauty of Joseon aqua fresh SPF 50\n* **PM**\n* Haruharu black rice oil cleanser\n* Haruharu black rice cleanser\n* Haruharu black rice toner\n* Purito unscented centella serum\n* The ordinary squalane (few drops)\n* Purito bamboo moisturiser\n* Thick layer of CeraVe Healing Ointment\n\nAny suggestions on ways to repair my skin barrier if it is indeed damaged, or if I perhaps need to try and alternative to retinoids?

As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "I’ve had really bad dandruff for over a year now. It’s not just light flakes it’s thick, stuck-to-the-scalp flakes, super itchy, and my scalp gets uncomfortable again just a day or two after washing. It looks a lot like **seborrheic dermatitis**  from what I’ve seen online.\n\nThe worst part is the hair fall. I’m losing SO much hair that it’s genuinely scaring me. Every wash, every comb  it feels like I’m slowly going bald. I know stress makes it worse, and I’m already under a lot of stress because my exams are right around the corner.\n\nBecause of that, I can’t visit a dermatologist right now. I don’t have the time or mental space, so I’m planning to order products online and just try to get this under control for now. I just want the itching and dandruff to stop, at least enough so the hair fall reduces.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\nAnti-dandruff shampoos with ketoconazole \nOr combination shampoos (ketoconazole + zinc pyrithione / ciclopirox / selenium sulfide, etc.)\n\nA leave-in lotion or serum that helps keep dandruff in check between washes\n\nAnything that helps control hair fall and help me regrow my hair\n\nWhat I don’t want:\n❌ Steroids (I don’t want rebound flares or dependency)\n❌ Minoxidil (not ready for the shedding or long-term commitment)\n\nExtra info:\nThe itching drives me crazy, especially at night\nDandruff comes back very fast after washing\n\nIf you’ve dealt with something similar and found anything that genuinely helped, please let me know  even if it’s a routine, shampoo rotation, or maintenance product. I’m honestly exhausted and just want some relief right now.\n\nP.S. I did take a little help from AI to organize my thoughts better the situation itself is very real though 😅\nI’ve attached a picture I found on Reddit because my dandruff looks almost exactly like this.\nThanks a lot 🤍",

      "content": "I’m going on a ski trip in a couple of months with my partner and a few of our friends and I’m trying to think of ways to speed up my hair routine so that the others aren’t waiting around for me. My partner asked the other day why I tend to take longer than other people to get ready and it’s got me worrying about how to keep up a presentable look while not wasting other people’s time.\n\nI’m a curly girl who also straightens my hair sometimes using the Shark FlexFusion. Both of my routines for curly or straight take a little while (straightening takes a bit longer though, about 30/40 mins with the wet to dry straightening function) but generally if I have curly hair I need to wash and reset it each day as the hair is so fine that the curls don’t hold in a ‘presentable’ way overnight. With straight hair I can usually get away with it for a couple of days without washing but the issue is it takes time to style it and the FlexFusion is noisy so using it for a long time in an apartment around other people would 100% be annoying. The other girls going on the trip have hair that is easier to manage so their ‘get ready’ routine is less complicated.\n\nI want to look presentable as we will be doing aprés ski, and tbh just because I care about looking put together as I don’t feel confident or myself if I don’t. I can’t see my curls not getting messed up with the headgear so I’ve thought about getting a temporary straightening treatment but I’m worried about it ruining the curls.. would really appreciate any other thoughts or advice",

Comes with LEDs and you can adjust the focus.\n\n**What's the point? Any benefit?**\n\nI was able to finally have a more accurate calculation of my current hair density.\n\nI have diffuse thinning and appear to be a Norwood 5 but turns out the active follicular count isn't too different in balding areas vs donor.\n\nThe main difference is the thickness of the hair and how many hairs I have per follicle.\n\nThe sides and back are much thicker strands and often come in groups of 2-3, whereas the thinning (mid/front scalp) are much thinner and often host a single hair.\n\nBoth areas have at least 50 units/cm2 which is typically good enough to have good cosmetic coverage (my sides and back look pretty normal imo).\n\nThis makes me more optimistic about my current treatment. Hopefully, the dutasteride will keep suppressing the DHT and the minoxidil will increase the diameter and grow more hairs per follicle.\n\nIt can be useful for you to verify your current situation — whether the follicles are even alive still — and adjust your expectations accordingly.\n\n  \n**How to calculate density**\n\n1. Adjusted the focus of the microscope so it showed the follicles on my head.\n2. Drew a dot on my hand and measured its diameter using a ruler (approximately 3 mm).\n3. Took a picture of the dot on my hand with the microscope (see last pic)\n4. On the computer, created a box around the dot to measure its size in pixels.\n5. Divided the width and length of the full picture (in pixels) by the dot measurements (from previous step).\n6. Multiplied the two results by the dot’s area, measured in square units (3 mm²), to obtain the area captured by the sensor (0.5 cm²).\n7. Count how many individual openings (follicles) appear in pictures taken in different areas of the scalp.\n\n  \nI think it's a good enough methodology. I kinda rushed the process but have stayed on the conservative side of estimates. Will probably re-do at some point just to be sure.",

I currently use the PanOxyl 10% Acne Foaming Wash at night. Will that react with my skin, and should I pick a more gentle face wash? Any and all product and general advice is appreciated! Cheaper/drugstore products are preferred, but I am willing to splurge on extraordinary products. TIA!!",

I'm really panicked because I've always had a HUGE fear of developing a coldsore and I am seeing my long distance partner for the first time in a long time next week. So I'd really rather not have a coldsore.\n\nAt first it looks like just one bump but if I smile or stretch my lips there appears to be other ones as you can see in the last pic.\n\nI was cleaning a really dusty room today so I was hoping the dryness and bumps were maybe just a reaction to the dust in the room. But now I'm not so sure.  It didn't feel tingly at first, but after I read posts saying that coldsores tingle, I have felt an on-and-off mild burning sensation on both my bottom and top lip on that side.\n\n  \nI do have and often get tiny pimples on my chin that look similar to this, especially after using an exfoliator, which I did yesterday.  but I don't know if they would appear on the lip. \n\nIf it is a cold sore, when could I expect it to develop further?  I have bad anxiety and this is really making me anxious and I feel I can't focus on anything else.",

I have hyperpigmentation under my eyes. Cebaceous filaments, they usually stack like on the side of my nose where it meets with my cheek skin. I also have some white heads.\n\nI also considered my body, I have some dry patches under my breast and overall dryness on my limbs. I also have darkness on my armpits probably due to shaving and also have clogged pores in there. I have acne in my back, chest and even breasts, between my breasts it is dry, under my breasts I have clogged pores. On my legs i have these things that look like bug bites and left me some scars?? i think it might have been acne, i also have acne on my thigh close to my bikini area.\n\nI want someone to help me change some of the products and hopefully also make it cheaper but at the same time that i could use to target all of these problems that i have on my body overall! I would be super grateful. Is okay to make fun of me as long as you can help me afterwards 😭\n\nI am overweight and sedentary which i am changing this year. I know that excersice can also improve your skin.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6ilksh990bg1.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67daa6abea1bb16b9d91838299982ab413582e36\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yotjwsh990bg1.png?width=907&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faac0620b7c9c0c4cf543a24114458ebf3b9da04\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ob27vsh990bg1.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d6fa3580afb574dafd7162d0b87d924abc54816\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5rqx2th990bg1.png?width=893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20abba5a110c37a2a2e0eb32977816ae933e3b7c\n\n",
