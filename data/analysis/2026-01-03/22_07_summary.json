      "content": "Hey reddit! Looking for some advice on this crazy curl pattern change. Over the last two years, my curl pattern has gone from the beautiful texture you see on the first slide to the flat, sad pattern in the second, and I’m so lost trying to figure out why. I didn’t change my routine until after the change had occurred, stayed with the same amazing curly hair stylist for years, and didn’t change locations (i.e. water stayed the same). \n\nHere’s the routine I was using 2-3x per week:\n- Oribe hair alchemy shampoo (2 washes) + conditioner\n- Oribe leave-in conditioner\n- Oribe curl gloss\n- Oribe curl mousse\n- Scrunched dry with a microfiber towel, then diffused on low heat. Finished with kerastase oil and oribe anti-humidity spray. \n\nAfter I really started to get frustrated with the change, I tried:\n- Two different heat protectants for over a year, thinking maybe heat damage was the culprit\n- AG Care Renew Clarifying shampoo once per week, thinking buildup may be contributing\n- Innersense True Enlightenment scalp scrub once per month \nThese changes did not make a difference :(\n\nI have consistently used a silk pillowcase and silk bonnet to sleep, both before and after the change. \n\nI fear that, after doing some research, the culprit may be hormonal changes associated with a change in my birth control, or maybe this is just aging-associated change that I can’t control. But, before I jump to talking with my doctor about making major medical changes, does anyone have any other ideas I can try? \n\nTIA for your help and for reading, I miss my curls and really appreciate your help getting them back!!",

I use Aussie detangler and shampoo when needed but most showers I just only use conditioner. \n\nI usually let it air dry and will put in some Not Your Mother's Curl leave in conditioner on occasions. I have a wide tooth comb I use, and a regular comb I will use to fix my part in the middle. I also sleep with satin pillow cases and also use a bonnet if I don't feel like wetting my hair the next day. \n\nI really want to keep growing it out, although how long it's taking is a tad frustrating some times.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Honestly, I feel stuck and don’t see a clear solution anymore.\n\nI joined Reddit specifically to ask for skincare advice from people who have experience or knowledge in this area. I genuinely want to improve my skin and understand what options I have.\n\nI’m 21 years old, and it feels like time is slipping by.

I don’t have constant flushing or visible veins, but my skin often looks red or irritated. I’m unsure if this is acne-related hyperpigmentation, irritation, or rosacea.\n\nThese are the products I’m currently using:\n\t•\tCeraVe Acne Control Cleanser (2% salicylic acid)\n\t•\tThayers Unscented Witch Hazel Toner\n\t•\tSKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil\n\t•\tCeraVe Moisturizing Cream\n\t•\tCeraVe Vitamin C Serum\n\t•\tRetin-A (tretinoin) 0.025%\n\t•\tLa Roche-Posay Anthelios SPF 100\n\nI’m open to changing my routine if something I’m using could be making things worse.\n\nHonestly, I’m feeling really discouraged. I’ve spent a lot of money on skincare without seeing the results I want, and it’s starting to affect my self-esteem. My skin feels irritated, and I’m worried I may have damaged my skin barrier. I’m really looking for gentle, effective advice on how to calm my skin, improve the discoloration, and prevent new breakouts without causing more irritation.\n\nAny insight or guidance would mean a lot. Thank you.",

That helped me learn a lot about skincare.\n\nPreviously: I would at times wash my face with any face wash handy, e.g. cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and then put on Nivea body lotion 72h one on face and neck during winter (WI, US)\n\nDec 31st 2025, I got the LRP Dry Skin Saver set at and used the cleanser, then the double repair cream and then the cicaplast on top at night. And daytime just cleanser and double repair. (What a dumb call, right? I am still upset I used all 3 new products at once).\n\nThen next day saw some whiteheads (?) forming and then ignored and continued the routine. Jan 2nd I saw small whiteheads or small pimple like stuff with acne feeling like getting worse too. So, currently stopped everything and just went back to Nivea body lotion. \n\nAny suggestions on what I did wrong and what I could do better to help skincare routine. Absolute total noob. \n\nFirst photo is after washing face with my cetaphil gentle cleanser and waiting few mins after wiping face. No products used after it. \n\n2nd photo is latest skin after the skincare routine (right after waking up and before washing face). I dont even fully understand my skin type. I am assuming combination? ",

Rn it’s like 99% dark brown 1% copper. \n\nIs there anyone that could give me at home tips on how to achieve a copper color ? \n\nMoreover, I’d almost want to dye it immediately but should I wait since it just got done ?",
