Over the last two years, my curl pattern has gone from the beautiful texture you see on the first slide to the flat, sad pattern in the second, and I’m so lost trying to figure out why. I didn’t change my routine until after the change had occurred, stayed with the same amazing curly hair stylist for years, and didn’t change locations (i.e. water stayed the same). \n\nHere’s the routine I was using 2-3x per week:\n- Oribe hair alchemy shampoo (2 washes) + conditioner\n- Oribe leave-in conditioner\n- Oribe curl gloss\n- Oribe curl mousse\n- Scrunched dry with a microfiber towel, then diffused on low heat. Finished with kerastase oil and oribe anti-humidity spray. \n\nAfter I really started to get frustrated with the change, I tried:\n- Two different heat protectants for over a year, thinking maybe heat damage was the culprit\n- AG Care Renew Clarifying shampoo once per week, thinking buildup may be contributing\n- Innersense True Enlightenment scalp scrub once per month \nThese changes did not make a difference :(\n\nI have consistently used a silk pillowcase and silk bonnet to sleep, both before and after the change. \n\nI fear that, after doing some research, the culprit may be hormonal changes associated with a change in my birth control, or maybe this is just aging-associated change that I can’t control. But, before I jump to talking with my doctor about making major medical changes, does anyone have any other ideas I can try? \n\nTIA for your help and for reading, I miss my curls and really appreciate your help getting them back!!",

I used to hair straighter/maybe a bit wavy hair, amd no one else living in my family had this hair(My maternal aunt did, but she passed as a teenager, unfortunately, long before I was born) and no one knows how to care for it. I am doing my best after neglecting my new curls.\n\nI have not acquired a 'Routine' yet, as I have not proper done research and have not done been very responsible. I know I have damaged by hair. I use a regular hair brush, but my mom suggested using a wide comb(she is slowly doing research with me) so I will be picking one up. My hair is also very, very thick; very long. My hair also likes to frizz. It also does not like to sit in generic hair ties very well. It was always a nightmare, now it's worse.\n\n I do not have a refresh routine, I air dry my hair, I do not style with any products, and I do not \"protect my hair while I sleep\". I also do not dye, bleach, straighten or curl my hair. I do not part my hair. These are all things I really have to do some research into and care for. It's all very... overwhelming, almost.\n\nI use OGX for Shampoo and I alternate between Bond Repair Repair &amp; Protect, and their Clarifying Strength+ Refresh and Clarify; I am a woman, and I have cycle, during that cycle I use both some days because my hair gets really greasy and oily[very ucky]. I don't use too much conditioner, but the brand is also OGX and it's something like Repair &amp; strengthen. OGX cleans my hair best. I seldom use conditioner, as everything I've tried makes me hair frizz worse. Which sucks big time.\n\nI picked up Shea Moisture-- Kalhari Melon Oil-- Curl Stretch Refersher spray on an impulse at Walmart. Not smart, I know, but I decided earlier that day that I wasn't going to fight my curls/wavy-curls--?-- any longer and that I was going to embrace them. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips? Brand recommendations? Hair care? Anything at all? I'll gladly take any advice or suggestions you have.",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m very new to skincare and honestly pretty ignorant about most of it, so please be gentle 😅\n\nI’ve been really lucky with my skin my whole life. I’ve never had acne or breakouts and usually get maybe one pimple a year. Because of that, I’ve always been hesitant to put products on my face and have kept my routine extremely minimal.\n\nRecently I decided to start taking my health and skincare more seriously (eating better, drinking more water, etc.). A friend gave me the Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water (pink cap) and since it’s marketed for sensitive skin, I thought it would be very gentle and safe. I did a lot of research beforehand and only saw good things. The bottle also says you don’t need to rinse it off.\n\nThat night, the only thing I used was the micellar water. I wiped my face afterward with a warm towel (which is basically all I ever do for skincare, just a warm washcloth morning and night). I also used salicylic acid, which I’ve used in the past without ever having an issue.\n\nWhen I went to bed, my skin looked fine. A few hours later, I noticed in my phone reflection that my face looked really bumpy. I checked the mirror and had tiny white bumps all over my face. I’ve never experienced anything like this before and it honestly really upset me. It’s been about two days now and it hasn’t improved and if anything it might be slightly worse. I’ve just been gently wiping my face with wet towels, but I’m not sure if that’s helping or making it worse.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this with this product? Does this sound like irritation, a reaction, or something else? Should I be doing something to help it go away, or just leave my skin alone?\n\nIt really sucks that this happened on New Year’s when I’m trying to get my life together, and now I feel like I messed up my skin 😞 Any insight would be really appreciated.",

Or just using a hair claw on slightly wet hair would make my perfectly straightened hair curled up somehow.\n\nHowever , the thought of my hair not being straight never occurred to me tbh.\n\nSo, now I’m  wondering if I’m making stuff up  and it looks like this because I did those hand movements while drying and should stick to straightening it better. Or maybe it is actually some sort of wavy/curly and its worth buying different products/taking care of it differently. 😭",
