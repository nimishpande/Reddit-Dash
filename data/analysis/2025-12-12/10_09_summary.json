      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "First things first. Lets talk about reset wash day. Saturday night or Sunday morning I do a total reset. I double shampoo using a regular moisturizing shampoo (amika for now) followed by mark anthonys daily bond and repair shampoo, then lay down a thick moisturizing mask conditioner. I do not do anything with my hair. I brush with a wide tooth comb and let it air dry. This is a rest day for my hair. No product, no styling, let it breath! (twice a month ill do the curl smith bond salve treatment and twice a month i do the maui cleansing shampoo on these days too.)\n\nMonday-shampoo with marc Anthonys daily bond and repair to get the oil of the deep conditioner off. Next is not your mothers (NYM) leave in conditioner and a light heat protectant. I let that sit and soak in while I do my other shower routine duties. I might mention I do all my styling in the shower. Get a mirror and shower organizer and bring all your products in there with you! Next ill apply a little bit of curl cream and rake that through with my fingers. I use cake beauty but I think any curl cream will be fine. Next, i section off my hair and ultimately do three sections, lower middle, and crown. Rake in NYMs defining medium hold gel. Brush through with the bounce curl brush. Repeat for the next two sections. The crown area is done with the \"no part\" technique and when I get to my bangs, I brush those forward. Now flip your head upside down and scrunch in the NYMs freeze 5 hold gel. Lots of gel! Gel is your friend!\n\nNow we are stepping out of the shower. Hair is dripping wet. Take a t-shirt, flip your head upside down, and scrunch out the excess water and product. \n\nThis next step has been whats the game changer for me: go in and scrunch with a gel to mousse/foam-the extra hold on not dripping wet hair has given me the definition dreams are made of. I use the AG gel to mousse.\n\nDiffuse with head completely upside down. Start with hover diffusing to get the cast going then start to cup dry and form the curls. 50% dry ill flip my head right side up (you're gonna look like you got electrocuted and this is a good sign! Trust the process.) and continue. This is the time to kinda lay down clumps in their spots so you dont have any wonky guys sticking out all sorts of ways. I dry to about 90% dry, break the cast JUST A BIT, continue cup diffusing to about 98% dry. I let them air dry the rest of the way to work and scrunch the crunch out and fluff at work, no oil, it weighs my the down. Voila. \n\nRefresh days: Even with all this work, these hardly last because I sleep in a loose pony tail on a silk pillow case. Refresh days are a lot easier as far as dry time and I get the same look. Dampen with a spray bottle, scrunch in NYMs curl cream (this prevents frizz!! I SWEAR BY IT!!), scrunch in the gel to mousse/foam, cup diffuse. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!!",

I mentioned the word “bronde.” She turned me golden blonde all over, which looks so bad on me as I’m a True Summer which means I have no warmth in my colouring at all. I’m very pale with blue eyes. You can see how this gold colour makes my face look weirdly pink. And she didn’t even cut my bangs, which is why I now don’t have any. \n\nI do have some Redken Shades EQ toners, but what should I use? Also, even if I did use them, it would tone down ALL the balayage. If I go somewhere else, should I ask for foils, in order to control where the toner goes? Or would that be lowlights? I’m so confused about what to ask for.\n\nOr, do you think it will tone down naturally?\n\nDon’t suggest using purple or blue shampoo. I have tried that so many times in my life and it’s never, ever made a hot of difference. \n\nI’m so pissed off. I literally asked for my grey roots to be done with my usual Level 6 and then some face-frame balayage, and I get a total brassy-head.\n\nThe first two photos are of my hair post-colour at the salon - not sure why the colour looks so different. The third photo is the last time I had my hair done before this time, in my own country, and is what I was expecting this time. \n\nHelp! Will it fade? Should I throw a toner in it, if so? Or should I get it professionally fixed, and if so, what should I ask for? It’s way too blonde and brassy. I’m so pissed off and upset.",

Then it was very wavy. Now it’s less so. The ends just flip up at this point. I even tried a bob and some major layering. \n\nMy hair is and always has been waviest at the beach. Humidity is usually her friend. \n\nThe purple hair is when I was using deva curl curl bond shampoo and moisture rich conditioner. Maybe their curl cream as well. \n\nI’ve tried sea salt spray. I’ve tried dreamcurl. I’m currently using shea moisture…the moisturizing peach colored label. I’ve tried their curl cream, I have tried their mousse, I have tried their smoothie. There’s a fine line for me between using enough that my hair absorbs it and using too much and having it look a bit damp all day. \n\nI’ve tried gel casts with garnier. My hair will curl up when I scrunch it up, but if I run my hands through it before scrunching it won’t hold the scrunch. Either way it falls before it dries. \n\nRoutine:\n\nRight now I’m just shampooing and conditioning with shea moisture (peach label…the moisture one) and letting it air dry. It flips on the ends. Sometimes the top layer will wave/curl but the bottom layer is always straight.\n\nI have very thick very soft hair. The strands themselves are medium to thick. \n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThe pics are in chronological order. ",

I woke up with my skin on chest/ part of breast/ back of neck until middle back/ shoulders.. covered with pustules and spots. it looks worse in real than in the pictures. Some of the pustules were quite big. I always had issues with my chest and back skin since being a teen (I am now 31), and never find solutions but this is next level for me. For more context I did sweat a lot overnight due to flu symptoms and I know sweat can be a trigger to acne or whatever this is but I never had it so bad. Can this be something else than acne ? And does anyone have recommendations to help my skin recovering quickly? I appreciate any help, it took me years to make peace and accept my difficult skin but this put me back to square one and took a toll on my self esteem. thanks a lot\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6yfd4yelq6g1.jpg?width=2314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d185eafdcb063bfc1a2ca774481dd245e9fa220f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rgwds2yelq6g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1ddb40bb6153e0621435bc8030a6de51fb42eae\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b9g4g4yelq6g1.jpg?width=2312&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=391a9f5f05586029d5a6ae93e91a2a3b521bece0",
