She also did a gloss colour which really well blended my creeping silvers (Lawd it’s been a stressful year) into my existing colour which feels lovely and natural. \nRoutine: First I used Keratase chroma absolu bain respect shampoo, tiny amount because it lathers quite well. Followed by Keratase chroma absolu mask, used fairly generously (though it’s probably £3 a scoop 😆) and left for 4-5 mins. She said not to use regular conditioner on curls but a mask instead.\nFollowed by Oribe curl cream, applied very wet with scrunching, learning with head tipped over (I do this still in the shower or it goes everywhere). \nLeft it to air dry as I like to keep heat away when I can (but it goes more tightly curled when diffused) \nAlso started to use a satin pillowcase and satin scrunchie (thanks to those here who recommended that great combo)",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "First things first. Lets talk about reset wash day. Saturday night or Sunday morning I do a total reset. I double shampoo using a regular moisturizing shampoo (amika for now) followed by mark anthonys daily bond and repair shampoo, then lay down a thick moisturizing mask conditioner. I do not do anything with my hair. I brush with a wide tooth comb and let it air dry. This is a rest day for my hair. No product, no styling, let it breath! (twice a month ill do the curl smith bond salve treatment and twice a month i do the maui cleansing shampoo on these days too.)\n\nMonday-shampoo with marc Anthonys daily bond and repair to get the oil of the deep conditioner off. Next is not your mothers (NYM) leave in conditioner and a light heat protectant. I let that sit and soak in while I do my other shower routine duties. I might mention I do all my styling in the shower. Get a mirror and shower organizer and bring all your products in there with you! Next ill apply a little bit of curl cream and rake that through with my fingers. I use cake beauty but I think any curl cream will be fine. Next, i section off my hair and ultimately do three sections, lower middle, and crown. Rake in NYMs defining medium hold gel. Brush through with the bounce curl brush. Repeat for the next two sections. The crown area is done with the \"no part\" technique and when I get to my bangs, I brush those forward. Now flip your head upside down and scrunch in the NYMs freeze 5 hold gel. Lots of gel! Gel is your friend!\n\nNow we are stepping out of the shower. Hair is dripping wet. Take a t-shirt, flip your head upside down, and scrunch out the excess water and product. \n\nThis next step has been whats the game changer for me: go in and scrunch with a gel to mousse/foam-the extra hold on not dripping wet hair has given me the definition dreams are made of. I use the AG gel to mousse.\n\nDiffuse with head completely upside down. Start with hover diffusing to get the cast going then start to cup dry and form the curls. 50% dry ill flip my head right side up (you're gonna look like you got electrocuted and this is a good sign! Trust the process.) and continue. This is the time to kinda lay down clumps in their spots so you dont have any wonky guys sticking out all sorts of ways. I dry to about 90% dry, break the cast JUST A BIT, continue cup diffusing to about 98% dry. I let them air dry the rest of the way to work and scrunch the crunch out and fluff at work, no oil, it weighs my the down. Voila. \n\nRefresh days: Even with all this work, these hardly last because I sleep in a loose pony tail on a silk pillow case. Refresh days are a lot easier as far as dry time and I get the same look. Dampen with a spray bottle, scrunch in NYMs curl cream (this prevents frizz!! I SWEAR BY IT!!), scrunch in the gel to mousse/foam, cup diffuse. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!!",

Ingredients:\n\n\n\n☀️IPCA Acne UV Gel Sunscreen - SPF 50, PA+++\n\n\nIngredients: Cyclopentasiloxane, Octinoxate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bemotrizinol, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Diinethicone,\nDiethylhexyl butamido triazone, Diethylhexyl\nSyringylidenemalonate, Fragrance,\nCyclopentasiloxane &amp; Dimethicone Crosspolymer.\n\n\n\n-------\n\n☀️UV Doux Sunscreen - SPF 50, PA+++\n\nINGREDIENTS:\nCyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone\nCross Polymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Silicone Elastomer Blend, Octyl Methoxy-cinnamate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone,\nDiethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl\nBenzoate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Diaxide, Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate (and)\nCaprylic/Capric Triglyceride,\nBemotrizinol, Fragrance.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n☀️UV Doux Blue Light Sunscreen - SPF 50, PA+++\n\nINGREDIENTS:\nCyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide (and) Coco-Caprylate/Caprate (and) Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate (and) Isostearic\nAcid, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl\nTriazine, Dimethicone, Talc (and) Titanium Dioxide (and) Iron Oxides (CI 77499 &amp; Cl 77491 &amp; Cl\n77492), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazoly!\nTetramethylbutylphenol, Thermus\nThermophillus Ferment (and) Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Melanin, Sodium Levulinate (and) Potassium Sorbate, Parfum.\n\n------\n\n☀️Photostable Gold Sunscreen - SPF 55, PA+++\n\nIngredients:\nCydopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimechicone\nand Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Capryti Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Ethyhexyl Mechaxycinnarace,\nCyclopentasiloxane (and) PEG/PPG-18/18 Dimethicone,\nMethylene Bis-benzotriazoly/ Tetramethybuty/phenol, CI2-CIS\nAlkyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methorypheryl Triatine\nDiethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexl Benzoate, Silica, Lauryl Laurate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Propylene Glycol (and)\nDizzolidinyl Urea (and) lodopropynyl Buryicarbamate and\nButylated Hydraxy Toluene.\n\n\n\n______________________________________\n\n⭐️2. What GPT has to say about Filters, Filter Review and Best For: \n\n\n☀️IPCA Acne UV Gel Sunscreen - SPF 50, PA+++\n\nFilters:\n\nOctinoxate (UVB), Uvinul A Plus, Bemotrizinol / Tinosorb M, Titanium Dioxide, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone\n\nFilter Review:\n\nA has a decent mix of chemical + physical filters, but relies on Octinoxate, which is less stable and weak for UVA. It gives okay sun protection but not the strongest for tanning or long UVA. Best suited if you want a lightweight silicone feel, but not ideal for harsh sun.\n\nBest for: Normal/oily skin, acne prone skin, indoor/outdoor mix, not for long sun exposure.\n\n\n-------\n\n\n☀️UV Doux Sunscreen - SPF 50, PA+++\n\n\nFilters:\n\nOctyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB), Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone (UVB), Uvinul A Plus (UVA), Bemotrizinol / Tinosorb M (broad spectrum), Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide\n\nFilter Review:\n\nThis is a strong hybrid sunscreen with both advanced chemical filters + zinc oxide, giving excellent UVA protection (tanning + pigmentation prevention). Photostable and broad-spectrum, just slightly heavier due to mineral filters.\n\nBest for: Normal/oily skin, Pigmentation-prone skin, long sun exposure, combination–oily skin.\n\n\n------\n\n☀️UV Doux Blue Light Sunscreen  - SPF 50, PA+++\n\nFilters:\n\nEthylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB), Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tinosorb S (Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine), Tinosorb M (MBBT), Melanin (visible light/blue-light), Iron Oxides\n\nFilter Review:\n\nThis has the most advanced modern filter combo: Tinosorb S + M + Zinc Oxide + melanin = top-tier UVA, UVB, visible light &amp; blue-light protection. One of the most complete and photostable formulas. Slightly richer feel but unmatched for sun damage protection.\n\nBest for: Normal/oily skin, Hyperpigmentation, melasma-prone skin, people who want max UVA + blue light. \n\n\n-------\n\n\n☀️Photostable Gold Sunscreen - SPF 55, PA+++\n\nFilters:\n\nEthylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB), Ethylhexyl Triazone (UVB), Uvinul A Plus (UVA), Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M\n\nFilter Review:\n\nThis is a strong chemical-only sunscreen with top-tier filters (Tinosorb S + M) but no Zinc Oxide, so long-UVA isn’t as complete as UV Doux ones. Very lightweight but contains stronger preservatives that may irritate sensitive skin.\n\nBest for: Normal/oily skin, indoor-heavy days, people who prefer non-mineral finish.\n\n\nGPT Recommends: \n\nBest Overall: UV Doux Blue Light Sunscreen  \n\nBest Hybrid: UV Doux Sunscreen  \n\nBest Lightweight Chemical: Photostable Gold Sunscreen \n\nGood but weakest: IPCA Acne UV Gel Sunscreen\n\n______________________________________\n\n⭐️ 3. Review from Personal Experience: \n\n\nSkin Type: Oily, sensitive, acne-prone, and closed-comedone prone.\n\nNote: All these sunscreens are non-comedogenic, water and sweat-resistant. Always double cleanse when using them.\n\n⸻\n\n☀️ IPCA Acne UV Gel Sunscreen – SPF 50, PA+++\n\nThis was recommended by my dermatologist. It feels less silicone-heavy compared to UV Doux.\nI tested it under strong sun with reapplication every 2–3 hours and it performed amazingly well. I didn’t tan at all. This is one of the first sunscreens that actually impressed me. I’ve tried so many Korean/Japanese/Indian sunscreens, but nothing comes close to this. The only con is the MRP. Emptied almost 6/7 tubes of it already. My go to sunscreen always.\n\nRating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)\n\n⸻\n\n☀️ UV Doux Sunscreen – SPF 50, PA+++\n\nThis was recommended by my friend, and I’m so glad I tried it. It’s heavier in silicones than Acne UV but works beautifully as a makeup base, my makeup doesn’t pill, and I don’t need a primer.\nThe texture is similar to Acne UV but more silicone-rich. It gives a slight white cast that settles within minutes.\nI haven’t tested it under long sun exposure like Acne UV, but I tested it for short wear in Sun and it performs just as well. My second favourite after Acne UV. I switch between Acne UV and this one always. Emptied around 3 tubes and already on my 4th. \n\nRating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)\n\n⸻\n\n☀️ UV Doux Blue Light Sunscreen – SPF 50, PA+++\n\nI always wanted to try a tinted sunscreen after seeing Dot &amp; Key’s marketing, but real reviews stopped me and I’m glad.\nI bought this one because it advertised blue-light protection, which I need since I sit in front of screens all day. I later found out it’s tinted after checking YouTube reviews.\nThis has been a lifesaver. On days I’m in a hurry and don’t want to wear makeup, I just apply this and walk out. The tint is subtle and blends in quickly with zero white cast. Also, once I learned that it contains one of the most stable UV filters, I liked it even more.\n\nRating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)\n\n⸻\n\n☀️ Photostable Gold Sunscreen – SPF 55, PA+++\n\nWhen I asked GPT earlier for the most photostable pharmacy sunscreens in India, it recommended Photostable Gold and Bello Photostable. I looked into them and picked this one.\nThe texture is slightly thinner than Acne UV and UV Doux, and somewhat similar to UV Doux Blue Light. It also feels less silicone-heavy than Acne UV.\nI haven’t started using it properly yet because I already have three sunscreens open, but the first impressions are very positive.\n\n______________________________________\n\n⭐4. RECOMMENDATIONS: \n\nIf your skin tolerates silicones and you want serious sun protection, you can blindly trust Acne UV and UV Doux. Make sure you double cleanse always while using these. \n\nIf you want a tinted option, choose UV Doux Blue Light.\n\nPhotostable Gold review i will do later once I’ve used it more along with Reequil.\n\n\n______________________________________\n\n⭐5. OTHER SUNSCREENS I HAVE TRIED: \n\ni) Indian Brands\n\nTrusted (after the above 4):\n\n\t•\tRe’equil – at par with the top 4\n\n\t•\tNeutrogena – horrible white cast and disliked the texture\n\n\t•\tL’Oréal – good\n\n\nBest Indoors:\n\n\t•\tEpisoft\n\n\t•\tFixderma\n\n\t•\tMinimalist\n\nWouldn’t recommend at all:\n\n\t•\tVLCC\n\t•\tLakme\n\t•\tDot &amp; Key\n\t•\tPlum\n\t•\tDeconstruct\n\t•\tThe Derma Co\n\t•\tLa Shield\n\n⸻\n\nii) Japanese Brands\n\n\t•\tBiore: Didn’t like it because the white cast never disappeared\n\n\t•\tNivea Water Gel: Good but not water-resistant\n\n\t•\tSkin Aqua: Good but again not water-resistant\n\n⸻\n\niii) Korean Brands\n\n\t•\tBeauty of Joseon Rice\n\n\t•\tBeauty of Joseon Aqua\n\nBoth are good and deserve the hype, but they are not water-resistant. Great for winters or indoor days, but a big NO for sunny/ outdoor summer days.\n\n\n\n\n⭐️ Please feel free to share your doubts/queries and recommendations. ",

      "content": "I’ve tried literally every trending skincare product for my acne — salicylic acid, niacinamide, tranxamic, vitamic c serum ,snail mucin, korean axis y niacinamide serum, and so many others. Nothing has made a noticeable difference on my face.\n\nRecently, I went to a dermatologist and took the medication they prescribed. My active acne cleared during the treatment, but the red marks (PIE) stayed. My doctor told me they would fade with time, but they didn’t. After finishing the medication, my pimples came back again.\n\nI tried using lacto calamine lotion as a spot on new pimples to dry them,it's works but now I’m getting a dark scars too. I’ve heard azelaic acids help with PIE, so I used that consistently (day and night) for 4–5 weeks, but my marks have barely improved.\n\nMy pores have become very visible and my skin looks textured. I feel like nothing is working anymore. This is my recent picture. Please suggest what I should do for the acne, red marks, dark spots, and large pores.

I have a wet detangling brush as well but I’m having a VERY difficult time detangling my hair despite different tools and products.\n\nStyling - hair is mostly soaking wet, had to use more Hask Leave In to further detangle, combed through Rizo’s Curl Defining Mousse in sections, then styled with a Denman brush in sections, scrunched in Jessicurl Spiralicious gel and plopped in tshirt for 20 mins, pixie diffused ends upside down then roots, then once fully dry used a very small amount of the oil I slept in to soften the curls.\n\nI’ve been sleeping in a pineapple bun on a satin pillowcase but it’s still destroying my curls. Will try the same method but with a bonnet tonight.\n\nMy plan today was to use less product and only use the mousse and maybe the gel, but I just couldn’t get my hair detangled. Also I’m sure I would benefit from another hair cut but are there any other suggestions to help detangle and have less frizz with more defined curls?",

It has never been chemically treated in any way, but is very long and I've never had any major haircuts. The texture is straight and thin. I blow dry my hair after every shower and keep it in a braid a lot of the time. (I know my hair is a nightmare case; however, I can't do too much to fix it due to personal circumstances.)\n\nMy old shampoo/conditioner was discontinued (Neutrogena's Moisturizing Hydro-Boost) and is impossible to find now. I have used basic drugstore brands like Suave, Tresemme, and Herbal Essences when I was younger and hated each of those options. Native's Moisturizing shampoo is okay but the conditioner does nothing to help my brittle and easily to tangled hair. Redkin's All Soft messed up my hair badly and left me with dandruff and grease... (I'm hesitant to try anything else from the brand, even if it's very highly rated. But I'm not entirely closed off.)\n\nI just want to try and find a product that tackles grease, avoids dandruff, takes into account sensitive scalps, and moisturizes. 😅\n\nI would appreciate any advice/suggestions/recommendations 🥲 If you think there is a better subreddit for me to ask this, please let me know.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "I’m 20M, currently with a bad hairline (I don’t know if it is a widows peak or just straight up hairloss), thin hair that is wavy (so TONS of frizz) which is even thinner at the mids and ends because it is bleached (it came out like hot roots when I did it back in August so I dyed it back to black). The wind is truly my worst enemy and my hair floats in certain spots and in others it stays flat (sometimes just flat, others flat looking straight forward).\n\nI’ve tried doing the middle part but NOTHING will hold it together. the middle part just ends up flying away and leaving me with a sort of hair hanging in the middle and the rest being swooped to the back but with 100 flyaways. When I try to wear it curly it looks greasy AND only a couple of curls form. \n\nI’m going on a trip to a colder country in January for 3 weeks, and the last week of december I am going on another trip. I need a haircut + styling routine that will look even in kind of heavy conditions. I know this isn’t possible with VERY strong winds but something that will not fly away from being outside for more than 5-10 minutes.\n\nI know I need to start medication, currently I cannot afford a derm to then get prescribed fin so I will most likely buzz my head and start topical minoxidil when I come back, but that is obviously going to take months. I want something that looks decent now.\n\nI’ve been looking into the warrior cut, as it’s like the variation of the french crop but without it being so harsh + I don’t like the straight fringe look. I’m semi-okay with fades, but maybe this time I’d rather have something that I could wear with or without a fade. However I’ve not seen it on people with thin hair neither would I know how to style it for it to actually last outside on thin hair. Also I’m afraid of going short as my hair hasn’t been short in a good few years. I’d be a lot more experimentative if I didn’t have these trips, but fortunately I do but it’s a bummer as I want to look really good in pictures. \n\nPlease any suggestions, even if it doesn’t fit the whole criteria, are appreciated. Also you can ask any questions. Thank you!\n",

I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin?
