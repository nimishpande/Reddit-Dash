      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "First things first. Lets talk about reset wash day. Saturday night or Sunday morning I do a total reset. I double shampoo using a regular moisturizing shampoo (amika for now) followed by mark anthonys daily bond and repair shampoo, then lay down a thick moisturizing mask conditioner. I do not do anything with my hair. I brush with a wide tooth comb and let it air dry. This is a rest day for my hair. No product, no styling, let it breath! (twice a month ill do the curl smith bond salve treatment and twice a month i do the maui cleansing shampoo on these days too.)\n\nMonday-shampoo with marc Anthonys daily bond and repair to get the oil of the deep conditioner off. Next is not your mothers (NYM) leave in conditioner and a light heat protectant. I let that sit and soak in while I do my other shower routine duties. I might mention I do all my styling in the shower. Get a mirror and shower organizer and bring all your products in there with you! Next ill apply a little bit of curl cream and rake that through with my fingers. I use cake beauty but I think any curl cream will be fine. Next, i section off my hair and ultimately do three sections, lower middle, and crown. Rake in NYMs defining medium hold gel. Brush through with the bounce curl brush. Repeat for the next two sections. The crown area is done with the \"no part\" technique and when I get to my bangs, I brush those forward. Now flip your head upside down and scrunch in the NYMs freeze 5 hold gel. Lots of gel! Gel is your friend!\n\nNow we are stepping out of the shower. Hair is dripping wet. Take a t-shirt, flip your head upside down, and scrunch out the excess water and product. \n\nThis next step has been whats the game changer for me: go in and scrunch with a gel to mousse/foam-the extra hold on not dripping wet hair has given me the definition dreams are made of. I use the AG gel to mousse.\n\nDiffuse with head completely upside down. Start with hover diffusing to get the cast going then start to cup dry and form the curls. 50% dry ill flip my head right side up (you're gonna look like you got electrocuted and this is a good sign! Trust the process.) and continue. This is the time to kinda lay down clumps in their spots so you dont have any wonky guys sticking out all sorts of ways. I dry to about 90% dry, break the cast JUST A BIT, continue cup diffusing to about 98% dry. I let them air dry the rest of the way to work and scrunch the crunch out and fluff at work, no oil, it weighs my the down. Voila. \n\nRefresh days: Even with all this work, these hardly last because I sleep in a loose pony tail on a silk pillow case. Refresh days are a lot easier as far as dry time and I get the same look. Dampen with a spray bottle, scrunch in NYMs curl cream (this prevents frizz!! I SWEAR BY IT!!), scrunch in the gel to mousse/foam, cup diffuse. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!!",

She also did a gloss colour which really well blended my creeping silvers (Lawd it’s been a stressful year) into my existing colour which feels lovely and natural. \nRoutine: First I used Keratase chroma absolu bain respect shampoo, tiny amount because it lathers quite well. Followed by Keratase chroma absolu mask, used fairly generously (though it’s probably £3 a scoop 😆) and left for 4-5 mins. She said not to use regular conditioner on curls but a mask instead.\nFollowed by Oribe curl cream, applied very wet with scrunching, learning with head tipped over (I do this still in the shower or it goes everywhere). \nLeft it to air dry as I like to keep heat away when I can (but it goes more tightly curled when diffused) \nAlso started to use a satin pillowcase and satin scrunchie (thanks to those here who recommended that great combo)",

I’m a little new to all this, always had a very simple routine and didn’t take too much time to research/find skincare products that suited me but I’ve been on a bit of a skincare journey the last few months trying to clear my skin and really find the best for me. I have very sensitive / combo skin, have a lot of issues with black/white heads, break outs on my chin etc. Right now I use Cetaphil cleanser and moisturiser / centella SPF. But I really need some help when it comes to retinols and salicylic acid, I’ve been seeing those are the best for cleansing pores, exfoliating etc? Correct me if I’m wrong though.\n\nI bought a cleanser with Salicylic acid and  niacinamide and it really irritated my skin, so I haven’t tried since. Do you have any recommendations on what I should use? (UK based) should I use both a retinol / salicylic but on different days? One or the other? Best products for sensitive / combo skin? Also seeing that I should double cleanse at night and not cleanse in the morning?\n\nRoutine right now AM cleanse Moisturise SPF\n\nPm cleanse Moisturise\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice, thank you ♥️",

It has never been chemically treated in any way, but is very long and I've never had any major haircuts. The texture is straight and thin. I blow dry my hair after every shower and keep it in a braid a lot of the time. (I know my hair is a nightmare case; however, I can't do too much to fix it due to personal circumstances.)\n\nMy old shampoo/conditioner was discontinued (Neutrogena's Moisturizing Hydro-Boost) and is impossible to find now. I have used basic drugstore brands like Suave, Tresemme, and Herbal Essences when I was younger and hated each of those options. Native's Moisturizing shampoo is okay but the conditioner does nothing to help my brittle and easily to tangled hair. Redkin's All Soft messed up my hair badly and left me with dandruff and grease... (I'm hesitant to try anything else from the brand, even if it's very highly rated. But I'm not entirely closed off.)\n\nI just want to try and find a product that tackles grease, avoids dandruff, takes into account sensitive scalps, and moisturizes. 😅\n\nI would appreciate any advice/suggestions/recommendations 🥲 If you think there is a better subreddit for me to ask this, please let me know.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I mentioned the word “bronde.” She turned me golden blonde all over, which looks so bad on me as I’m a True Summer which means I have no warmth in my colouring at all. I’m very pale with blue eyes. You can see how this gold colour makes my face look weirdly pink. And she didn’t even cut my bangs, which is why I now don’t have any. \n\nI do have some Redken Shades EQ toners, but what should I use? Also, even if I did use them, it would tone down ALL the balayage. If I go somewhere else, should I ask for foils, in order to control where the toner goes? Or would that be lowlights? I’m so confused about what to ask for.\n\nOr, do you think it will tone down naturally?\n\nDon’t suggest using purple or blue shampoo. I have tried that so many times in my life and it’s never, ever made a hot of difference. \n\nI’m so pissed off. I literally asked for my grey roots to be done with my usual Level 6 and then some face-frame balayage, and I get a total brassy-head.\n\nThe first two photos are of my hair post-colour at the salon - not sure why the colour looks so different. The third photo is the last time I had my hair done before this time, in my own country, and is what I was expecting this time. \n\nHelp! Will it fade? Should I throw a toner in it, if so? Or should I get it professionally fixed, and if so, what should I ask for? It’s way too blonde and brassy. I’m so pissed off and upset.",

I have a wet detangling brush as well but I’m having a VERY difficult time detangling my hair despite different tools and products.\n\nStyling - hair is mostly soaking wet, had to use more Hask Leave In to further detangle, combed through Rizo’s Curl Defining Mousse in sections, then styled with a Denman brush in sections, scrunched in Jessicurl Spiralicious gel and plopped in tshirt for 20 mins, pixie diffused ends upside down then roots, then once fully dry used a very small amount of the oil I slept in to soften the curls.\n\nI’ve been sleeping in a pineapple bun on a satin pillowcase but it’s still destroying my curls. Will try the same method but with a bonnet tonight.\n\nMy plan today was to use less product and only use the mousse and maybe the gel, but I just couldn’t get my hair detangled. Also I’m sure I would benefit from another hair cut but are there any other suggestions to help detangle and have less frizz with more defined curls?",

I’ve tried dreamcurl. I’m currently using shea moisture…the moisturizing peach colored label. I’ve tried their curl cream, I have tried their mousse, I have tried their smoothie. There’s a fine line for me between using enough that my hair absorbs it and using too much and having it look a bit damp all day. \n\nI’ve tried gel casts with garnier. My hair will curl up when I scrunch it up, but if I run my hands through it before scrunching it won’t hold the scrunch. Either way it falls before it dries. \n\nRoutine:\n\nRight now I’m just shampooing and conditioning with shea moisture (peach label…the moisture one) and letting it air dry. It flips on the ends. Sometimes the top layer will wave/curl but the bottom layer is always straight.\n\nI have very thick very soft hair. The strands themselves are medium to thick. \n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThe pics are in chronological order. ",

I have fine, straight hair that gets super oily if I don’t wash it within a day or two. Right now I’m using Head &amp; Shoulders, which I know isn’t the “healthiest” shampoo, but it’s what I’ve been sticking with.\n\nI’ve used Biolage and Redken in the past, but maybe I just haven’t used the right ones — so I’d definitely love any specific recommendations people have! Nothing has really solved the oiliness yet.\n\nI live in a place with harsh winters, so my scalp and hair feel a bit all over the place .\n\nI’ve also heard mixed things about hair serums — some people say they help, others say they make oiliness worse. So I’d love any input on:\n\n• Shampoo recommendations that help with oily, fine, straight hair\n\nDry shampoo recommendations \n\n• Whether you’d suggest sulfate-free / clarifying / dandruff formulas\n\n• Any hair oils/serums that actually work without making things greasier\n\n• Winter hair care tips that help balance oil without stripping moisture",

      "content": "My hair soft fine hair, doesn’t tangle easily. I have few ringlets but it’s almost straight or wavy in top. The inside layer of my hair is wavy and shiny while the top and facing layers are frizzy puffy and curlier (I think it’s called Irish curls?). I don’t have issues with drying the inside layer as it drys perfectly wavy without volume regardless of the drying method, and looks healthier. However, it’s very tricky for the outer layer as it’s dryer yes, so I use products to hydrate it, but it can be easily weighed down. I don’t like too much products on my hair, I like the airy feeling of my hair; any extra heaviness and I won’t feel my hair is clean personally. While I like the no volume look, I like the natural texture. My hair is so fine it’ll still move with diffuser creating a lot of unwanted volume and eventually frizz. When I do my hair using diffuser usually it drys frizzy curly, but the second day I end up with frizzy and wavy hair, and I think it’s from the extra volume it creates. My hair doesn’t hold its texture well.\n\nDo you have any tips on how to dry similar hair without aiming for volume?\n\nHair routine: I wash my hair every 2 days using Philip Kingsley weightless shampoo and moisture balancing conditioner. About 1-2 times a week I’d use pre-shampoo hair mask PK Elasticizer. Recently I started using their bond repair line (oil and balm) every other wash and I really love the oil it controls the baby hairs so well and my hair feels softer. For the other wash I like to change product for example if I like light hold I’d use PK Primer spray or Oribe alchemy serum, or maybe PK leave in (all of these are heat protectors). I do occasionally try gels and mousses, I have PK gel which is very lightweight which I like, and I have Oribe mouse for 2A-3C hair which I hates as it adds weight (I also tried their curl cream which I also hate).",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
