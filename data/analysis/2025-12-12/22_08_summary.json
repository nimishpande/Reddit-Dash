      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

If I have time I’ll defuse for longer, or if not enough I use a microfiber towel to help soak up the water.\n\nLastly, I’ve been properly pineappling my hair at night and been wearing a silk bonnet with silk pillowcases.\n\nBecause I don’t crunch my hair the first day, it helps me go longer between washes. 💜",

      "content": "Hello everyone! I’ve started wanting to get into ACTUALLY caring for my hair instead of just picking a random shampoo and conditioner and hoping it works and then pulling it up all day every day.\n\nI have dense, course, low (?) porosity hair, but I have never used a clarifying shampoo/chelating shampoo to remove any buildup that might be there so I’m not entirely sure if my hair is truly LOW porosity.\n\nI have a mix of 2b and 2c I’m pretty sure. maybe some 3a? I attached a picture of what my hair looks like when I actually style my curls (i.e., gel, mouse, diffuse, etc.) and of what my hair typically looks like day to day without styling (just wash, condition, and leave-in).\n\nin my routine I use the OGX Coconut Curls shampoo and conditioner, double shampooing, and switch between the Function of Beauty curly hair leave-in and the Not Your Mothers Curl Talk leave-in. I also used the Aveda Nutri-Plenish daily moisturizing treatment before and it worked pretty well, but it’s too expensive for me to rebuy consistently. when styling I use the Aveda Nutri-Plenish styling mouse and curl gel and scrunch both in in sections and then diffuse. I feel like the shampoo and conditioner do okay because my roots and bottom layers closer to my scalp are pretty soft, but my top layers and ends are always crazy dry and frizzy. I use a satin pillowcase and dry my hair with a microfiber towel after showering.\n\nthere is at least 2 inches that needs to be chopped, but even when I didn’t need a cut my hair has always been super dry.\n\nI’m hoping to get some assistance on:\n\n- good ingredients to stick to (I’ve read humectants, lightweight oils [argan, coconut, etc], and lightweight products) for my hair type and typically avoiding proteins. I’ve already read the silicones are good for low porosity, especially in humid areas (I’m in SE Texas close to Galveston)\n\n- best way to go about clarifying and removing all possible buildup (I’ve read going with a clarifying shampoo [i.e., Suave] and a chelating shampoo or an apple cider vinegar soak and then redoing the porosity test)\n\n- product recommendations for shampoo/conditioner (I know typically sticking to the same line is beneficial due to pH)\n\n- any other additional help and advice that would be beneficial or good to know\n\nI am doing my own research alongside this post, but getting additional information from people who may have dealt with similar problems to myself would help a lot.\n\nTHANKS!!",

My routine is l’oréal elvive color safe wash, and verb ghost conditioner, then when soaking wet I use the curlsmith flexi jelly all over with praying hands and lightly scrunch. I usually diffuse a little and then mostly air dry. Sometimes I use the rizos curl cream instead of gel! I also clarify using ouais clarifying shampoo once a week. \n\nPic 2 is what my hair looks like day 2 no matter what. I have tried satin pillow case, pineapple and no matter what I get straight pieces that look kind of fried and I always end up completely re wetting to make it look decent. \n\nPic 3 is what my hair looks like when photographed and I’m hoping for haircut advice so it looks less flat? I’ve never gotten a curl specific hair cut but I really like the shag style cuts where it gets rid of the triangle shape.

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I don't use any styling brush and don't want to, I just scrunch the products into wet hair after showering, gel after cream.\n\nThen I let my hair air dry, and at night I sleep with a silk bonnet and silk pillowcase. I do not have a refresh routine. Once a month, or sometimes every two months depending on how my hair is, I will use ion clarifying shampoo and HASK argan oil deep conditioner.\n\nAgain, I did not change my routine at all.

Yet, no matter what I do, my hair never looks the way I wish it to. It feels like I have just one continuous layer of curls (the outer one), and even it is almost completely hidden down to just above the ends (of which I have few) by a nest of frizz; frizz which is so bad that it persists when my hair is wet. It would not matter anyway; the following morning, whatever curls there are will be dried out and hidden by even more frizz. To compound matters, the advice I get ranges from \"you can do nothing about it\" to \"you need moisture\" to \"scrunch it!\" (which I already do). I am quite ready to give up; what is the point of my hair, if after an hour-long wash, with hundreds of dollars in hair products, it barely looks better than how I started off?\n\nRoutine if you need it: Rinse, Shampoo (Aunt Jackie's Clarifying or Moisturising Shampoo, either raked through hair), Condition (Cantu moisturising masque, or SheaMoisture moisturising conditioner, with praying hands), comb (bounce brush or fine tooth comb, I find the former works slightly better), rinse (though recently I am trying to \"squish to condish\", which as of now has not worked at all), apply LottaBody leave-in (praying hands), apply Curl keeper gel (praying hands), scrunch while wet, wait, then scrunch out the crunch.",

My active acne cleared during the treatment, but the red marks (PIE) stayed. My doctor told me they would fade with time, but they didn’t. After finishing the medication, my pimples came back again.\n\nI tried using lacto calamine lotion as a spot on new pimples to dry them,it's works but now I’m getting a dark scars too. I’ve heard azelaic acids help with PIE, so I used that consistently (day and night) for 4–5 weeks, but my marks have barely improved.\n\nMy pores have become very visible and my skin looks textured. I feel like nothing is working anymore. This is my recent picture. Please suggest what I should do for the acne, red marks, dark spots, and large pores.

      "title": "Help needed. Struggling with refreshing wavy hair.",
      "content": "I only realized my hair is wavy a few months ago. My hair is fine, 2a waves, and I believe it is low porosity. I am also very sensitive to products, and have to stick to products that are fragrance free and don’t have a lot of botanical ingredients. \n\nI wash my hair every 5th day. It runs dry, and washing more often makes hair and scalp too dry. My problem in needing a refresh is generally not that my scalp is oily, but that my waves fall flat. I generally avoid dry shampoo as it makes my scalp flaky. \n\nStill figuring out a routine. I’ve been doing a wash now style later to try to make it the full five days without adding too much product (fine hair gets weighed down), but it’s not working great. Plus, I wash at night, so wash day style is wasted. I tried the LUS all in one this week and skipped mousse and that seems a little better. Included some photos. \n\nCurrent routine is wash and condition with Cleure, add either Curlsmith fragrance free leave in or LUS wavy and let air dry. Medusa clip and sleep on satin pillowcase. I wash at night, so it gets ruined if I fully style. Day 2 can usually go as is, plus or minus a little spray oil, and day three I do the “style later” technique by spraying hair with water (damp, not soaked) and adding product. Paul Mitchell clear styling glaze (like gel) and No nothing mousse seem to make hair stringy and dull looking with frizz, but good volume. LUS and styling glaze also a little dull. Days 4 and 5 are a struggle, because I usually can’t add more product (too fine) but it is getting flat and losing waves. A light water refresh helps, but gets flatter as the day goes on. \n\nPictures show freshly washed and air dried with LUS, my style later (day 3) where I added styling glaze and more LUS, plus day 4 after a little water and LUS. Last photo is a style later (day three) with mousse, styling glaze, and pixie diffuse. Felt like bad technique and like I was forcing the hair to wave more. Even that goes flatter after a few hours. \n\nI welcome any fragrance free and gentle product recommendations, plus techniques. I do plan to grow hair a bit longer, so if the answer is that we put our hair up by days 4 and 5, so be it. Just trying to understand how much I should expect out of a multi day refresh.
