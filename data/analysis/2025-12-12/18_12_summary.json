She also did a gloss colour which really well blended my creeping silvers (Lawd it’s been a stressful year) into my existing colour which feels lovely and natural. \nRoutine: First I used Keratase chroma absolu bain respect shampoo, tiny amount because it lathers quite well. Followed by Keratase chroma absolu mask, used fairly generously (though it’s probably £3 a scoop 😆) and left for 4-5 mins. She said not to use regular conditioner on curls but a mask instead.\nFollowed by Oribe curl cream, applied very wet with scrunching, learning with head tipped over (I do this still in the shower or it goes everywhere). \nLeft it to air dry as I like to keep heat away when I can (but it goes more tightly curled when diffused) \nAlso started to use a satin pillowcase and satin scrunchie (thanks to those here who recommended that great combo)",

      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Ingredients:\n\n\n\n☀️IPCA Acne UV Gel Sunscreen - SPF 50, PA+++\n\n\nIngredients: Cyclopentasiloxane, Octinoxate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bemotrizinol, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Diinethicone,\nDiethylhexyl butamido triazone, Diethylhexyl\nSyringylidenemalonate, Fragrance,\nCyclopentasiloxane &amp; Dimethicone Crosspolymer.\n\n\n\n-------\n\n☀️UV Doux Sunscreen - SPF 50, PA+++\n\nINGREDIENTS:\nCyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone\nCross Polymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Silicone Elastomer Blend, Octyl Methoxy-cinnamate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone,\nDiethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl\nBenzoate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Diaxide, Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate (and)\nCaprylic/Capric Triglyceride,\nBemotrizinol, Fragrance.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n☀️UV Doux Blue Light Sunscreen - SPF 50, PA+++\n\nINGREDIENTS:\nCyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide (and) Coco-Caprylate/Caprate (and) Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate (and) Isostearic\nAcid, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl\nTriazine, Dimethicone, Talc (and) Titanium Dioxide (and) Iron Oxides (CI 77499 &amp; Cl 77491 &amp; Cl\n77492), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazoly!\nTetramethylbutylphenol, Thermus\nThermophillus Ferment (and) Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Melanin, Sodium Levulinate (and) Potassium Sorbate, Parfum.\n\n------\n\n☀️Photostable Gold Sunscreen - SPF 55, PA+++\n\nIngredients:\nCydopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimechicone\nand Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Capryti Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Ethyhexyl Mechaxycinnarace,\nCyclopentasiloxane (and) PEG/PPG-18/18 Dimethicone,\nMethylene Bis-benzotriazoly/ Tetramethybuty/phenol, CI2-CIS\nAlkyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methorypheryl Triatine\nDiethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexl Benzoate, Silica, Lauryl Laurate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Propylene Glycol (and)\nDizzolidinyl Urea (and) lodopropynyl Buryicarbamate and\nButylated Hydraxy Toluene.\n\n\n\n______________________________________\n\n⭐️2. What GPT has to say about Filters, Filter Review and Best For: \n\n\n☀️IPCA Acne UV Gel Sunscreen - SPF 50, PA+++\n\nFilters:\n\nOctinoxate (UVB), Uvinul A Plus, Bemotrizinol / Tinosorb M, Titanium Dioxide, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone\n\nFilter Review:\n\nA has a decent mix of chemical + physical filters, but relies on Octinoxate, which is less stable and weak for UVA. It gives okay sun protection but not the strongest for tanning or long UVA. Best suited if you want a lightweight silicone feel, but not ideal for harsh sun.\n\nBest for: Normal/oily skin, acne prone skin, indoor/outdoor mix, not for long sun exposure.\n\n\n-------\n\n\n☀️UV Doux Sunscreen - SPF 50, PA+++\n\n\nFilters:\n\nOctyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB), Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone (UVB), Uvinul A Plus (UVA), Bemotrizinol / Tinosorb M (broad spectrum), Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide\n\nFilter Review:\n\nThis is a strong hybrid sunscreen with both advanced chemical filters + zinc oxide, giving excellent UVA protection (tanning + pigmentation prevention). Photostable and broad-spectrum, just slightly heavier due to mineral filters.\n\nBest for: Normal/oily skin, Pigmentation-prone skin, long sun exposure, combination–oily skin.\n\n\n------\n\n☀️UV Doux Blue Light Sunscreen  - SPF 50, PA+++\n\nFilters:\n\nEthylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB), Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tinosorb S (Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine), Tinosorb M (MBBT), Melanin (visible light/blue-light), Iron Oxides\n\nFilter Review:\n\nThis has the most advanced modern filter combo: Tinosorb S + M + Zinc Oxide + melanin = top-tier UVA, UVB, visible light &amp; blue-light protection. One of the most complete and photostable formulas. Slightly richer feel but unmatched for sun damage protection.\n\nBest for: Normal/oily skin, Hyperpigmentation, melasma-prone skin, people who want max UVA + blue light. \n\n\n-------\n\n\n☀️Photostable Gold Sunscreen - SPF 55, PA+++\n\nFilters:\n\nEthylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB), Ethylhexyl Triazone (UVB), Uvinul A Plus (UVA), Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M\n\nFilter Review:\n\nThis is a strong chemical-only sunscreen with top-tier filters (Tinosorb S + M) but no Zinc Oxide, so long-UVA isn’t as complete as UV Doux ones. Very lightweight but contains stronger preservatives that may irritate sensitive skin.\n\nBest for: Normal/oily skin, indoor-heavy days, people who prefer non-mineral finish.\n\n\nGPT Recommends: \n\nBest Overall: UV Doux Blue Light Sunscreen  \n\nBest Hybrid: UV Doux Sunscreen  \n\nBest Lightweight Chemical: Photostable Gold Sunscreen \n\nGood but weakest: IPCA Acne UV Gel Sunscreen\n\n______________________________________\n\n⭐️ 3. Review from Personal Experience: \n\n\nSkin Type: Oily, sensitive, acne-prone, and closed-comedone prone.\n\nNote: All these sunscreens are non-comedogenic, water and sweat-resistant. Always double cleanse when using them.\n\n⸻\n\n☀️ IPCA Acne UV Gel Sunscreen – SPF 50, PA+++\n\nThis was recommended by my dermatologist. It feels less silicone-heavy compared to UV Doux.\nI tested it under strong sun with reapplication every 2–3 hours and it performed amazingly well. I didn’t tan at all. This is one of the first sunscreens that actually impressed me. I’ve tried so many Korean/Japanese/Indian sunscreens, but nothing comes close to this. The only con is the MRP. Emptied almost 6/7 tubes of it already. My go to sunscreen always.\n\nRating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)\n\n⸻\n\n☀️ UV Doux Sunscreen – SPF 50, PA+++\n\nThis was recommended by my friend, and I’m so glad I tried it. It’s heavier in silicones than Acne UV but works beautifully as a makeup base, my makeup doesn’t pill, and I don’t need a primer.\nThe texture is similar to Acne UV but more silicone-rich. It gives a slight white cast that settles within minutes.\nI haven’t tested it under long sun exposure like Acne UV, but I tested it for short wear in Sun and it performs just as well. My second favourite after Acne UV. I switch between Acne UV and this one always. Emptied around 3 tubes and already on my 4th. \n\nRating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)\n\n⸻\n\n☀️ UV Doux Blue Light Sunscreen – SPF 50, PA+++\n\nI always wanted to try a tinted sunscreen after seeing Dot &amp; Key’s marketing, but real reviews stopped me and I’m glad.\nI bought this one because it advertised blue-light protection, which I need since I sit in front of screens all day. I later found out it’s tinted after checking YouTube reviews.\nThis has been a lifesaver. On days I’m in a hurry and don’t want to wear makeup, I just apply this and walk out. The tint is subtle and blends in quickly with zero white cast. Also, once I learned that it contains one of the most stable UV filters, I liked it even more.\n\nRating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)\n\n⸻\n\n☀️ Photostable Gold Sunscreen – SPF 55, PA+++\n\nWhen I asked GPT earlier for the most photostable pharmacy sunscreens in India, it recommended Photostable Gold and Bello Photostable. I looked into them and picked this one.\nThe texture is slightly thinner than Acne UV and UV Doux, and somewhat similar to UV Doux Blue Light. It also feels less silicone-heavy than Acne UV.\nI haven’t started using it properly yet because I already have three sunscreens open, but the first impressions are very positive.\n\n______________________________________\n\n⭐4. RECOMMENDATIONS: \n\nIf your skin tolerates silicones and you want serious sun protection, you can blindly trust Acne UV and UV Doux. Make sure you double cleanse always while using these. \n\nIf you want a tinted option, choose UV Doux Blue Light.\n\nPhotostable Gold review i will do later once I’ve used it more along with Reequil.\n\n\n______________________________________\n\n⭐5. OTHER SUNSCREENS I HAVE TRIED: \n\ni) Indian Brands\n\nTrusted (after the above 4):\n\n\t•\tRe’equil – at par with the top 4\n\n\t•\tNeutrogena – horrible white cast and disliked the texture\n\n\t•\tL’Oréal – good\n\n\nBest Indoors:\n\n\t•\tEpisoft\n\n\t•\tFixderma\n\n\t•\tMinimalist\n\nWouldn’t recommend at all:\n\n\t•\tVLCC\n\t•\tLakme\n\t•\tDot &amp; Key\n\t•\tPlum\n\t•\tDeconstruct\n\t•\tThe Derma Co\n\t•\tLa Shield\n\n⸻\n\nii) Japanese Brands\n\n\t•\tBiore: Didn’t like it because the white cast never disappeared\n\n\t•\tNivea Water Gel: Good but not water-resistant\n\n\t•\tSkin Aqua: Good but again not water-resistant\n\n⸻\n\niii) Korean Brands\n\n\t•\tBeauty of Joseon Rice\n\n\t•\tBeauty of Joseon Aqua\n\nBoth are good and deserve the hype, but they are not water-resistant. Great for winters or indoor days, but a big NO for sunny/ outdoor summer days.\n\n\n\n\n⭐️ Please feel free to share your doubts/queries and recommendations. ",

Nothing has made a noticeable difference on my face.\n\nRecently, I went to a dermatologist and took the medication they prescribed. My active acne cleared during the treatment, but the red marks (PIE) stayed. My doctor told me they would fade with time, but they didn’t. After finishing the medication, my pimples came back again.\n\nI tried using lacto calamine lotion as a spot on new pimples to dry them,it's works but now I’m getting a dark scars too. I’ve heard azelaic acids help with PIE, so I used that consistently (day and night) for 4–5 weeks, but my marks have barely improved.\n\nMy pores have become very visible and my skin looks textured. I feel like nothing is working anymore. This is my recent picture. Please suggest what I should do for the acne, red marks, dark spots, and large pores. I’m honestly tired now.\nI badly want a clear skin i am done with this acne it's been 4 year dealing with this someday it get cleared nd then suddenly it came back again 😭😭😭 \n\nMy current skincare is cleanser suggest by derma,ponds moisturizer and deconst sunscreen and fr night I repeat same step but if I have pimple I use lacto calamine lotion oonly on pimple rest i aaply azelaic acid but recently I stoped both these things because nothing is working ...!! \n\n",

Yet, no matter what I do, my hair never looks the way I wish it to. It feels like I have just one continuous layer of curls (the outer one), and even it is almost completely hidden down to just above the ends (of which I have few) by a nest of frizz; frizz which is so bad that it persists when my hair is wet. It would not matter anyway; the following morning, whatever curls there are will be dried out and hidden by even more frizz. To compound matters, the advice I get ranges from \"you can do nothing about it\" to \"you need moisture\" to \"scrunch it!\" (which I already do). I am quite ready to give up; what is the point of my hair, if after an hour-long wash, with hundreds of dollars in hair products, it barely looks better than how I started off?\n\nRoutine if you need it: Rinse, Shampoo (Aunt Jackie's Clarifying or Moisturising Shampoo, either raked through hair), Condition (Cantu moisturising masque, or SheaMoisture moisturising conditioner, with praying hands), comb (bounce brush or fine tooth comb, I find the former works slightly better), rinse (though recently I am trying to \"squish to condish\", which as of now has not worked at all), apply LottaBody leave-in (praying hands), apply Curl keeper gel (praying hands), scrunch while wet, wait, then scrunch out the crunch.",

I have a wet detangling brush as well but I’m having a VERY difficult time detangling my hair despite different tools and products.\n\nStyling - hair is mostly soaking wet, had to use more Hask Leave In to further detangle, combed through Rizo’s Curl Defining Mousse in sections, then styled with a Denman brush in sections, scrunched in Jessicurl Spiralicious gel and plopped in tshirt for 20 mins, pixie diffused ends upside down then roots, then once fully dry used a very small amount of the oil I slept in to soften the curls.\n\nI’ve been sleeping in a pineapple bun on a satin pillowcase but it’s still destroying my curls. Will try the same method but with a bonnet tonight.\n\nMy plan today was to use less product and only use the mousse and maybe the gel, but I just couldn’t get my hair detangled. Also I’m sure I would benefit from another hair cut but are there any other suggestions to help detangle and have less frizz with more defined curls?",

      "title": "[Personal] My baking soda disaster - a cautionary tale",
      "content": "Here's how I managed to mess up my own armpits with baking soda as if it were Holy Water.\n\nI was someone who usually sweats at an average rate. During summer, if I took a bath in the morning, I would smell okay until noon and would have a mild odor at dusk. During winter, I could skip two days without smelling anything. But I wanted something better for summer, and I'm just so stubborn about resisting things that aren't natural. So I tried lemon juice. Useless. I also tried baking soda because my mom said it works for her. I would mix it with a bit of water and rub it on my skin after taking a bath. Almost daily.\n\nBut first? It was amazing. Shockingly so. Not 12 hours, but 24 hours without wearing deodorant. My mom quit after a couple weeks because it made her itchy. Yeah, lucky woman.\n\nYet eventually, the magic wore off. The odor started creeping back, and things began to reverse. I disregarded it. Continued using it anyway. And then things accelerated. My underarms began to stink while I was still leaving the shower. I am not kidding. I would clean myself thoroughly, shave as often as I could, and then dry off and make sure. and it would be there. A fungus, maybe. So I quit with the baking soda, but I could still smell bad.\n\nDermatologist 1 - Unhelpful. Prescribed me some medication. Didn't explain anything. I didn't ask either. I took it for two weeks. Result: no change.\n\nAt the same time, I began carrying an extra shirt with me to work during winter. I would change shirts in the office wc before leaving for work at night as if I were some sort of tragic undercover agent. And let me tell you, if you're thinking that's some sort of psychological thing, no.\n\nDermatologist 2 - actually touched my skin and said there was no fungus but bacteria that dug deep and wouldn't leave with washing. And he prescribed me two creams: an antibiotic and an antifungal, just in case. Use it twice a day for three months, he said. Three Months.\n\nThe odor disappeared instantly from my skin. I lived normally for 2.5 months. But then a new curse struck. And that curse was sweating. Not sweating. I'm talking waterfall proportions. Imagine sweat stains on my shirts because they would be flowing down almost a hand's length. Whether it's summer or winter. Constant sprinkler system functioning beneath my armpits.\n\nI toughed it out and completed the three months, stopped using the creams… and a few short days passed and then I smelled again. Not as pungently as before, but no less terrible. Which put me with two problems instead of having none: unwanted odor, Niagara Falls under both arms.\n\nEventually, I abandoned all therapies. No more creams, no more remedies, no more \"natural\" experiments. Just regular cleanliness and careful washing, no soap overload. I no longer apply soap directly—to my hands I lather, then apply it lightly and thoroughly rinse.\n\nIt's been about eight months since I quit everything. And finally – finally – the waterfalls are dry, and the smells have receded. I I have no idea what I just went through but I am grateful to be almost normal.\n\n**Note 1:** My English isn't very good. I used AI for help with translation and editing. I hope I'm not breaking any rules here.\n\n**Note 2:** I have the prescription photos if anyone's curious.\n\n ",

Every winter for the past 4 years I struggle with this seb derm.\n\nHas anyone here reacted badly to this many moisturizers?\n\nDid you find anything extremely “safe” or a routine that works for super reactive skin?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice! 🙏",

I used to use the SA cleanser, but moved in with my boyfriend and he had this one open, so I didn't want to open a new bottle. If I wear makeup I use castor oil to get rid of it pre washing my face.  I wear SPF 60 when going outside - Neutrogena sensitive skin (I like this one a lot and have been using it for almost 8 years or so). I've always had a lot of acne, which started when I was 10. Some of it is cystic, but usually not. I pick at my skin absent minded most of the time, so I know this is making my acne worse. My face is also oily, though leaning towards normal now that I'm 22 and scarred. The products I've been thinking about are CORSX advanced snail 96 mucin power essence and corsx aha BHA clarifying treatment toner. I used to use niacinamide from the ordinary and hyaluronic acid from a different brand. Niacinamide never did it for me and broke me out more even after months of usage. \n\nI'd like to introduce a 0.1% retinol, which one would you recommend? Are the corsx products I listed okay? I'm not necessarily looking for clearest skin right away. I just want it to be healthier. Are there any other products? How would you split these things into am/pm? I know retinol is pm, but would it work with the corsx products - I assume it wouldn't be good to use when I use the aha BHA.\n\nThank you!",
