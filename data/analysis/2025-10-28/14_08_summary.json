      "title": "Diffuse Thinning From Low Iron and Thyroid -Finally Seeing Regrowth After Fixing the Root Cause",
      "content": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share my personal hair loss journey in case it helps someone. (29F here,) I went through a nightmare of hair shedding due to a mix of nutrient deficiencies and an undiagnosed thyroid issue. At my worst, I was pulling clumps of hair from the shower drain every wash. I remember crying in the shower as I watched strands slip through my fingers. 😢 Losing my hair made me feel less feminine, insecure, and honestly pretty hopeless.\n\nFor nearly two years I searched for answers. Doctors initially brushed it off as “stress” and told me to just take biotin (which did nothing). I pushed for thorough bloodwork, and I’m so glad I did. It turns out I have Hashimoto’s (an autoimmune thyroid condition) causing hypothyroidism, and my iron levels were abysmally low (ferritin was 15!). Basically, my body wasn’t getting what it needed for healthy hair. On one hand I was relieved to finally have a cause, but on the other it was scary to know I have these underlying issues.\n\nI threw everything I could at the problem (with medical guidance). Here are a few things that ended up helping me get my hair back on track:\n\n**Proper medical treatment: I started thyroid medication for the hypothyroidism and an iron supplement for the deficiency.** Getting my TSH and iron/ferritin levels into a healthy range has been key.\n\n**Diet &amp; lifestyle: I cleaned up my diet and made sure to eat more protein and veggies (for nutrients).** Also started doing yoga and reducing stress, since stress definitely made my shedding worse.\n\n**Vitamins: I added a daily vitamin spray (Colorlife Vitamin A + Iodine) to support my thyroid and fill any nutrient gaps.** I’m terrible at remembering to take pills, so a quick spritz is easier for me and ensures I’m getting those thyroid-supporting nutrients.\n\n**Gentle hair care: I ditched harsh shampoos and heat styling. Now I use a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo and only finger-comb when possible.** I also started using silk pillowcases and scrunchies to reduce breakage. These didn’t fix the root cause, but they helped minimize additional damage while my hair recovers.\n\nIt’s been about 6 months since I got a proper diagnosis and started this multi-pronged approach. The difference is night and day. My shedding has slowed way down - no more handfuls of hair in the drain 😅 - and I’m seeing tons of baby hairs and regrowth along my hairline. My ponytail even feels a bit thicker than it did a few months ago. I’m not back to my old full head of hair yet and I know it’ll take time, but for the first time in ages I feel hopeful. More importantly, I feel empowered now that I understand what’s happening with my body.\n\nEmotionally, it’s still a work in progress. Hair loss took a real toll on my self-esteem. But these days I’m focusing on small victories (like those tiny new hairs!) and practicing self-compassion. I remind myself that hair growth is slow and that I’m doing everything I can. Reading others’ stories here has been a huge comfort, so thank you to this community. 🌼\n\nIf you’re going through something similar, hang in there. You’re not alone and it can get better once you find the root cause and treat it. Feel free to ask me anything about what I tried or just vent - I know how rough this journey is.\n\nQuestion for you all: Has anyone else experienced hair loss due to thyroid issues or nutrient deficiencies? What ended up helping you the most, and how long did it take to see improvement? I’d love to hear your stories or any tips on coping and encouraging regrowth. Thank you for reading, and I’m sending good vibes to everyone dealing with this. 🙏💜",

It is the picture I’ve shown to the hairdresser every time.\n\nNow, This is the fourth time I’ve gone to the hair dresser, shown the photo, and not gotten what I wanted. \n\nI simply don’t have the budget to get it coloured that often, especially when I’m unhappy with the results.\n\nSo I’ve come to the conclusion to try and fix it at home, using professional techniques and products of course. \nOf course, it won’t be the same as a educated hair stylist, but at least I will have full control over my hair and if I’m unhappy, I can blame myself and not loose any money.\n\nI have painted for many years so i thankfully have quite good color theory and precision, so I’m hoping that will help.\n\nI’ve spent the last few weeks researching and taking notes on how hair dying works, the hair molecules, what developer does, the different hair melanins, color theory etc.\n\n\nAnyways!!! \nSo, I’ve come to the conclusion that what I want to do to achieve the inspiration is:\n\n- Caramel brown base\n- honey blonde highlights\n- Auburn lowlights\n\nBut the problem is, that I’m not applying this to my virgin hair ( that is a level 5 Medium brown btw ) but I’m applying it to 4 different failed attempts at this color🥲🥲 Some which har halfway grown out. \nFoils were placed throughout my hair every time, but I never got a full base dye. \n\nI just don’t know what to do with this base! \n\nDo I just wing it, dying the whole thing caramel brown, and then making the highlights and lowlights after?\n\nAlso unsure if I should use Demi permanent dye, or permanent, as it is quite a tedious dye job, and a bit of a hassle to go through too often - but demi is much more forgiving if it looks completely off. \n\nFor context about my hairs natural state:\n\nLevel 5 medium brown\nLow porosity \nType 1\nCoarse very thick hair ( I’ve been dying my hair since I was 13, and my experience is that it can handle quite a lot. My hair is frizzy in the picture, because of the texture not damage. ) \n\nReally really hoping some of you have any advice on how to navigate this! ♥️",

Now that I'm older this all kind of blurs together, its easy for me to remember distinct products/looks/etc- but lately I am finding that I simply cannot remember the website that all these youtubers were using and recommending.\n\nIt was veryyyy similar to Ulta and Sephora, but they had smaller indie brands (I remember they were one of the few places to sell lime crime), and I believe a pink design/theme. I am almost convinced that it was based in the UK or AUS and they shipped worldwide, I also believe they had the word \"glam\" somewhere in their name or logo. \n\nI'm mostly looking for nostalgia, but also because it was great to be able to buy all the different brands in one place. I've checked out Beautylish and Cult Beauty, they seem super similar to this website as well. Does this sound familiar to literally anyone or am I going crazy?",

As far as I understand, silicone somewhat smooths/seals the cuticle and forms a protective layer which would make it harder for other things to penetrate to the hair.\nSo is there any benefit (esp hair health benefit) on applying a non-silicone containing hair oil after a silicone containing leave-in and styler?",

I have so many of them, and every time I think about washing and waiting forever for them to dry, I just… don’t. I also have acne-prone skin, so I *know* I should be cleaning them way more often. But the process is just annoying.\n\nI know there are brushes cleaner and dryer machine out there but the thing that I dont like is how they take 2-5 hours to dry the brushes and I can only do a few brushes at a time. Because of this I am actually thinking about making one myself and get rid of this hassle and make it SUPER easy for everyone to clean their makeup brushes within 10 (clean &amp; dry). Would really love to hear from others who deal with the same struggle, what stops you from keeping your brushes clean? What are something you dont like about the current makeup brushes dryer and cleaner machine? Would love to take feedback to make the better cleaner and dryer for everyone.",
