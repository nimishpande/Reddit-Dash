      "content": "I spent months searching for the perfect hair stylist to help me style my curls for my wedding day. The first stylist I found had beautiful photos from past brides, but no curly haired brides. During our consultation call the artist insisted I come in with dry hair with no product for my hair trial🙃. I convinced her to at least let me prep my hair with all my normal products so she could style it without having to worry about applying product. When we finished our trial I was let down because my hair, even with all my products was so fizzy and didn’t look as good as I had hoped. Don’t get me wrong, this artist does a great job doing bridal hair, but didn’t know how to handle my curls.\n\nI then reached out to a hair artist who I had been stalking on social media and specialized in curly hair. She was much more expensive but based off her posts on social media I knew she would be worth it. I trusted her so much just based off our texts and calls I decided to skip a hair trial. Come day of my wedding she gave me the most perfect hair I could ever dream of. My hair had definition and great volume! I’ll never ever regret embracing my curls on my wedding day, it made me feel so beautiful to embrace my natural beauty. So if you’re getting married soon and thinking about rocking your curls, invest in an artist that specializes in curly hair so you feel like the most beautiful version of yourself!!!\n\nFYI I did my normal wash day routine using the Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Shampoo and Conditioner. My hair artist applied only Rizos Curls products, not sure exactly which products but that’s the only brand she said she uses for her curly hair brides. ",

It goes all the way up to my cheeks and a lot of hair on my neck. It hasn’t been an easy decision but i’m just too tired from the constant shaving. But i’m absolutely terrified about this! I shave now 3 or even 4 times a day if I go somewhere in the evening. The shaving doesn’t even work because the hair is so thick. I use heavy make up to cover the stubble. It’s really annoying always having to reapply the makeup. I have to stay home weekends because my skin can’t take all the shaving so then I let my beard grow. But I can’t even go for a walk or get milk then. It grows really fast so it’s very visible if I don’t shave for two days. I’m constantly thinking if people notice my stubble and when I can shave the next time. My body is also covered in thick dark hair. It’s on my whole back, chest, shoulders, stomach, upper arms, arms, hands, fingers, butt, thighs, legs, feet and even toes. I’m a lot hairier than most men.  Especially here in Finland men have very little hair. I have never seen anyone this hairy. Even if I look up severe hirsutism online or social media it’s never this bad. My endocrinologist admitted this is very rare to have this serious hirsutism and that I’m the worst case she has heard of. I shave the hair on my fingers and hands every day although you can still see bit of a stubble there. Otherwise I just cover my body with clothes even in summer. So I have also decided to stop covering the hair and just wear what I want to. I’m really depressed and self conscious about my condition. And i’m worried how people will react and if there is a lot of staring. I do already get stared though because I’m extremely obese with bmi 62. (yes i’m on ozempic and metformin before anyone asks). I have also had laser on my face and tried every possible medication and supplements. Nothing works. My testosterone is very high due to pcos. I also have pretty bad baldness because of that and wear a wig. Sometimes I think about ditching the wig. On top of this all I also grow a thick unibrow which i pluck. But I’m seriously considering going all the way and letting it just grow. Anyone share this kind of situation. I’m really scared to do this! I do go to therapy so that helps a bit and my therapist is very supportive about this. I went to the grocery store last sunday evening so that I had last shaved friday around 4 pm. And I felt absolutely horrible and I think people were staring. Monday morning I shaved again. But my plan is to stop this friday for good. And just go monday to work with my beard and mustache. Any advice or experience?",

The front feels flat with almost no volume, and the curls have clumped into long, heavy sections. Is there any way to fix this?\n\nI waited over 72 hours before washing, followed all the care instructions my stylist gave me, and only used high end products I bought directly from the salon: shampoo, conditioner, curl gelee, and dry shampoo.\n\nI was extremely gentle during washing. I lightly massaged the shampoo and conditioner into my scalp, then carefully patted my hair dry with a soft towel. While still wet/damp, I applied the curl gelee, scrunched it in, and used a Dyson dryer with a diffuser on cool/low heat.\n\nNow it just feels heavy and flat, especially in the front.

Please can the geniuses of this sub provide some of your knowledge and help me with my ever failing skin routine.\n\nI have always been dry and flaky, but as I have got to my mid 20s (25F) I’m also getting oilier… I have constant flaking and separation on my skin, especially cheeks and nose, where it feels like I am shedding 24/7 and nothing ever helps.  A lot of the dry skin products I have historically used now seem to just “sit” on the surface without absorbing, and make my T zone ridiculously oily. My skin always looks dull, I struggle with redness around my nose and fine lines in my forehead.\n\nNot acne prone with the occasional hormonal cyst popping up on my chin. Large pores naturally and some scarring due to skin picking issues as a teen.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nAM; cleanse with water &amp; cotton pads, the inkey list vitamin C serum, weleda skin food light, biore ultra UV spf.\n\nPM: remove makeup with vitamin E oil, double cleanse with vitamin E oil &amp; cotton pads, Paula’s choice BHA toner, Byoma hydrating serum, weleda skin food light.\n\nI have tried all sorts of routine variation but my skin doesn’t shift. I have to manually exfoliate on occasion as it gets so bad. Does anyone have any advice from a similar skin type? I rarely wear base makeup anymore as it makes it look even worse..\n\nAny feedback would be wonderful, thanks all &lt;3",

      "content": "\nHey everyone, my sister has had an awful couple of years and a very traumatic pregnancy. Basically, her hair was neglected.  It wasn’t brushed through enough. \n\nAs a result, It’s gotten really matted over time, and the knots are so bad now that I’m scared it might be beyond what a leave-in conditioner can fix. Her hair is now 3 large thick matts, with some almost dreadlock ends.  She currently keeps it ina bun to hide it in.  Out of sight out of mind. \n\nShe’s also just had a baby, so I really want to do as much as I can and hopefully help her feel beautiful   \nIt honestly broke my heart seeing her hair today, shes  been through so much. \n\nIf anyone has tips, gentle detangling methods, or knows someone who’s experienced with severe matting, please share. Any advice or recommendations would mean the world right now. I’m willing to try everything and anything. \n\nP.s - she is aware of shaving it all off, but we both want to see if with time and patience we can save her hair. ",
