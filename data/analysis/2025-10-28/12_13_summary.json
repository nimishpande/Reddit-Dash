The curls went a little flat. Usually when I practiced this style I didn’t let it sit for ~an hour between drying and styling. But I’m fairly happy with how it turned out.

I tried various kinds of oil-free products, mattifying gels, and lighter creams, but nothing really made a difference. By lunchtime, my T-zone would usually get shiny, and my cheeks often felt tight at the same time, which never made sense to me.\n\nOne week I randomly washed my face with cooler water because my bathroom heater broke, and my skin seemed to calm down a bit. There was less tightness and my T-zone didn’t get as greasy by midday. I didn’t change my cleanser or moisturizer; the only difference was the water temperature.\n\nIt seems that hot water can strip away some of your natural oils, causing your skin to produce a little extra to compensate. Using cool or lukewarm water can help your skin feel more balanced. Just avoid ice-cold water because it can irritate sensitive skin. Even this small change made a noticeable difference for me, and I did a quick search online and found some studies suggesting that cooler water can indeed help maintain the skin barrier and reduce excess oil.",

      "content": "my skin (oily in summers, acne-prone, often hormonal, clogged forehead and cheeks, dry in winters) was doing so well back in september of 2025. then the weather started getting colder- the snail mucin moisturizer i used wasn’t moisturizing enough. so i had to switch to a thicker cream, like every winters. last winter i used nivea creme, and it worked wonders for me. my routine was- tret (prescribed) once a week, and himalaya aloe vera face wash, nivea creme. pretty basic and drugstore. but this was back in another country which was suuuuper dry. then i came back here, to delhi NCR region. now winters were a struggle. nivea creme broke me out, so i switched to nivea soft. \n\nworked fine for the longest time, then summers came this year and i switched to snail mucin cream. the first two photos are of that- my routine included- \n\nAM-\n- simple face wash (WRP)\nconsious chemist niacinamide + txa + alpha arbutin (still skeptical about this)\n- snail mucin cream (costs a lot, prolly gonna get sebamed clear gel next summers)\n- sunscreen (re’equil ultra matte dry touch) (WRP).\nPM-\n- face wash \n- deconstruct 0.2% retinol 1% peptide (twice a week)\n- salicyclic acid minimalist (once a week)\n- snail mucin cream\n\nthen came colder weather. snail mucin wasn’t enough, so i was looking to go back to nivea soft. but that gave me textured and bumpy skin, closed comedones esp on my cheeks are around my mouth. made my skin look dull. so i looked up some moisturizers and tried foxtale purple one. broke me out more. then i gave it away and after a lot of anticipation, got bioderma atoderm creme ultra- since my skin is technically dry in winters? but now this is my current skin. doing weird things, reddness, dullness, breaking out cystic. i don’t know what to do. \n\nany suggestions could help. i was thinking maybe the serums are the issue but they worked fine in summers? the only thing i’ve changed is moisturizer. and i’m sick of purchasing things. \n\nadditional info:\ncetaphil never worked for me, always broke me out. both the DAM and lotion. gave them away last year too.

Now that I'm older this all kind of blurs together, its easy for me to remember distinct products/looks/etc- but lately I am finding that I simply cannot remember the website that all these youtubers were using and recommending.\n\nIt was veryyyy similar to Ulta and Sephora, but they had smaller indie brands (I remember they were one of the few places to sell lime crime), and I believe a pink design/theme. I am almost convinced that it was based in the UK or AUS and they shipped worldwide, I also believe they had the word \"glam\" somewhere in their name or logo. \n\nI'm mostly looking for nostalgia, but also because it was great to be able to buy all the different brands in one place. I've checked out Beautylish and Cult Beauty, they seem super similar to this website as well. Does this sound familiar to literally anyone or am I going crazy?",

      "title": "Diffuse Thinning From Low Iron and Thyroid -Finally Seeing Regrowth After Fixing the Root Cause",
      "content": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share my personal hair loss journey in case it helps someone. (29F here,) I went through a nightmare of hair shedding due to a mix of nutrient deficiencies and an undiagnosed thyroid issue. At my worst, I was pulling clumps of hair from the shower drain every wash. I remember crying in the shower as I watched strands slip through my fingers. 😢 Losing my hair made me feel less feminine, insecure, and honestly pretty hopeless.\n\nFor nearly two years I searched for answers. Doctors initially brushed it off as “stress” and told me to just take biotin (which did nothing). I pushed for thorough bloodwork, and I’m so glad I did. It turns out I have Hashimoto’s (an autoimmune thyroid condition) causing hypothyroidism, and my iron levels were abysmally low (ferritin was 15!). Basically, my body wasn’t getting what it needed for healthy hair. On one hand I was relieved to finally have a cause, but on the other it was scary to know I have these underlying issues.\n\nI threw everything I could at the problem (with medical guidance). Here are a few things that ended up helping me get my hair back on track:\n\n**Proper medical treatment: I started thyroid medication for the hypothyroidism and an iron supplement for the deficiency.** Getting my TSH and iron/ferritin levels into a healthy range has been key.\n\n**Diet &amp; lifestyle: I cleaned up my diet and made sure to eat more protein and veggies (for nutrients).** Also started doing yoga and reducing stress, since stress definitely made my shedding worse.\n\n**Vitamins: I added a daily vitamin spray (Colorlife Vitamin A + Iodine) to support my thyroid and fill any nutrient gaps.** I’m terrible at remembering to take pills, so a quick spritz is easier for me and ensures I’m getting those thyroid-supporting nutrients.\n\n**Gentle hair care: I ditched harsh shampoos and heat styling. Now I use a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo and only finger-comb when possible.** I also started using silk pillowcases and scrunchies to reduce breakage. These didn’t fix the root cause, but they helped minimize additional damage while my hair recovers.\n\nIt’s been about 6 months since I got a proper diagnosis and started this multi-pronged approach. The difference is night and day. My shedding has slowed way down - no more handfuls of hair in the drain 😅 - and I’m seeing tons of baby hairs and regrowth along my hairline. My ponytail even feels a bit thicker than it did a few months ago. I’m not back to my old full head of hair yet and I know it’ll take time, but for the first time in ages I feel hopeful. More importantly, I feel empowered now that I understand what’s happening with my body.\n\nEmotionally, it’s still a work in progress. Hair loss took a real toll on my self-esteem. But these days I’m focusing on small victories (like those tiny new hairs!) and practicing self-compassion. I remind myself that hair growth is slow and that I’m doing everything I can. Reading others’ stories here has been a huge comfort, so thank you to this community. 🌼\n\nIf you’re going through something similar, hang in there. You’re not alone and it can get better once you find the root cause and treat it. Feel free to ask me anything about what I tried or just vent - I know how rough this journey is.\n\nQuestion for you all: Has anyone else experienced hair loss due to thyroid issues or nutrient deficiencies? What ended up helping you the most, and how long did it take to see improvement? I’d love to hear your stories or any tips on coping and encouraging regrowth. Thank you for reading, and I’m sending good vibes to everyone dealing with this. 🙏💜",

I have to wear masks for my job and it irritated the blister and popped it etc.\n\nAnyway, the scab and everything fell off well over 4 weeks ago at this point (at the end of September). But I still have this little dark blemish exactly where the sore was. Is it a scar? And I was also wondering if it’s still contagious? I haven’t kissed my girlfriend in almost 2 months because I was paranoid about giving it to her. It’s really getting to her but I want to make sure it’s not contagious before moving onward.\n\nThere is no bump, blister, fluid, anything like that. It’s just normal skin that a shade darker where the sore was.\n\nAlso for clarity, I know that area of my lip has a different pigmentation. It’s been like that since I was a kid. The specific mark I’m referring to you is in the colored circle.\n\nAny and all help would be very much appreciate !",

Wednesday conditioner \"wash\" without fully washing it off\n2. Saturday shampoo, wash it off, leave conditioner/mask for few minutes, then wash it off.\n3. Since my hair gets bed hair in the morning (if i shower in the evening rather than in the morning) i put mixture of water and conditioner on my hair with spray bottle.\n4. I put my mousse 2 times a week after conditioning my hair\n5. When putting product i scrunch my hair\n6. I dry it by leaving it air dry mostly, but i pat my hair slightly or if its late at night i plop.\n\n**Questions regarding routine, cgm etc:**\n\n* How many times a week can i put mousse?\n* My hair gets curly on top (big difference from before), but not as much curls as i want to probably beacuse my lenght is not as long? I'am a guy who is letting his hair grow to bit shorter than shoulder hair (surfer hair), so i don't have as much hair on sides as on top. Note: mousse defines curls much more and i get better curls, and i get better curls if i dont shower in the morning and i put conditioner water mix afterwards.\n* General advice regarding my hair for CGM?\n* Is it possible to get greekish curly hair on a wavy type?\n\nThanks for all,",
