      "content": "# I worked 6 years in the hair transplant industry, across 3 different companies, so I’ve seen a lot behind the scenes. I’m not saying every clinic that does these things is bad but if you see several of these at once, be careful.\n\nSome major red flags in my opinion:\n\n1. If they try to sell you overpriced shampoos, vitamins, or serums under the name of “aftercare.” Good aftercare matters, but it shouldn’t be mandatory or ridiculously expensive.\n2. If they offer DHI or FUE like they’re just menu options. They should tell you which technique is actually best for YOU based on your donor area, hair type, and long-term plan. If they just ask you to choose, where are the ethical standards?\n3. If they claim the anesthesia is “completely painless.” Manageable? Yes. Totally painless? That’s marketing.\n4. If you can’t find out who will actually perform the operation beforehand. You shouldn’t meet the team 5 minutes before surgery.\n5. If the clinic does more than 5 surgeries per day. That’s usually a sign of a hair mill.\n6. If they have 1,000+ Google or Trustpilot reviews. Realistically, maybe 5% of patients leave reviews. Numbers like that should make you pause.\n7. If they do 3,000+ DHI grafts in a single day. Possible, yes but graft survival becomes a serious concern.\n8. If they do 5,000+ FUE grafts in one day without using HypoThermosol. Unless you’re extremely lucky, some of those grafts will die.\n9. If they keep bombarding you with messages, pushing you to “decide now.” High-pressure sales tactics have no place in medical decisions.\n10. If they offer massive or “limited-time” discounts. Medical procedures shouldn’t feel like Black Friday sales.\n\nCan a good result still happen despite these red flags?  \nSure. You might also win the lottery this year.\n\nJust don’t trust clinics that promise everything and explain nothing.\n\nHope this helps.",

Mulberry Extract\nA gentle tyrosinase inhibitor. What this does is it slows the enzyme that makes excess pigment. Good for people who want brightening without irritation.\n\n2. Niacinamide\nDoesn’t lighten melanin!\nInstead, it reduces melanosome transfer, which means less pigment gets passed to the surface layers.\nAmazing for acne marks, PIH\n\n3. Alpha Arbutin\nA stable brightening ingredient that also inhibits tyrosinase, but gradually\nGreat for uneven tone without harshness.\n\n4. Licorice Extract\nContains glabridin + liquiritin. Magical as they are, both work as tyrosinase suppressors + anti-inflammatory... Licorice is giving 😌\nSo it treats dark spots and the inflammation causing them.\n\n5. Centella (Cica)\nMy favourite when it comes to formulating! Not a brightener by itself, but reduces inflammation + oxidative stress, which are major triggers for pigmentation.\n\nBiggest rule for pigmentation :\nREDUCE INFLAMMATION FIRST.\nBrightening only works when the skin is calm.\n\nHope this helps!",

      "content": "People always say *“Rooney must’ve never taken fin”* whenever his hair comes up, but honestly that explanation is kinda lazy and doesn’t line up with how hair loss meds work in real life.\n\nWayne Rooney reportedly started finasteride around 2009 ([https://www.theonlineclinic.co.uk/news/2009/05/20/RooneyToGoOnPropecia.aspx](https://www.theonlineclinic.co.uk/news/2009/05/20/RooneyToGoOnPropecia.aspx)).\n\nHe then had that famous hair transplant in 2011, followed by another transplant in 2013. Fast-forward, only 3 years later in 2016, his hair looked awful and looked almost completely bald. ([https://www.thesun.co.uk](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/1255974/wayne-rooneys-two-previous-hair-transplants-appear-to-have-flopped-as-he-prepares-for-euro-2016-with-a-threadbare-rug/))\n\nThese days he pretty clearly uses hair fibres to make it look fuller. If fin was this guaranteed “stop button,” none of that should’ve happened. But it did.\n\nA lot of people here like to say *“well he just didn’t take it consistently”*, but the uncomfortable truth is that fin (and even dut) only slow hair loss, they don’t stop it for everyone. Especially if you’ve got aggressive genetics, all they really do is buy you time. For some guys that’s 10–15 years. For others it’s like… 3–5 years and then the loss just keeps marching on.\n\nRooney started losing early and aggressively. Fin likely helped *slow things down*, but it clearly didn’t freeze his hair forever, even with multiple transplants backing it up. And meds didn't save his native hair from continuing to miniaturise.\n\nAnd it’s not just Rooney. There are plenty of normal, well-documented cases of guys who started early (NW2-ish), stayed on fin for 12 years, and still ended up heavily thinned or basically bald. Here’s one of those documented cases people like to ignore: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WxN5ocR6TU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WxN5ocR6TU)\n\nSo yeah, Rooney isn’t proof that fin “doesn’t work”, but he *is* proof that fin doesn’t work equally well for everyone, aggressive hair loss will often win eventually, and meds mostly delay the inevitable, not stop it.\n\nAnyone pretending otherwise is just coping or hasn’t been on this journey long enough yet on.",

Earlier this year I had cheek filler dissolved after regretting it almost instantly. What followed was one of the hardest periods of my life. I lost a lot of volume quickly and my face didn’t feel like me anymore. Not just the way it looked but the way it felt. Unsupported sunken and heavy. Like it wasn’t holding me.\n\nI searched everywhere. Reddit threads forums youtube even clinical studies. Most of what I found was fear sadness or silence. What helped me feel visible progress might help someone else feel less alone. Deep facial massage. Not a spa facial not gua sha or lymphatic drainage only but something that works with tension fascia and deeper things you don’t even realize your face has been holding onto. I found someone who understood that skin health isn’t just topical it’s emotional too.\n\nI never expected this to help me. My muscles softened my skin woke up and I looked like me again not cause something fake was added but cause something real returned. My face held shape again felt more integrated brought back a sense of glow and support. I finally feel like myself again.\n\nAfter the first session I noticed something shift. Not just in how my face looked but in how I felt inside it. My face stopped collapsing inward visually and physically. My eyes and face softened. I can look down again without seeing my skin fall. I feel held and that feeling is really everything when you’ve been walking around trying to pretend you’re okay. This wasn’t some luxury fix. I didn’t need more procedures. I just needed to feel safe and like myself again.\n\nIf you’re reading this and you’re going through something similar please know it’s not hopeless. You’re not broken. Your face remembers you. I have nothing to gain from sharing this except the hope that it helps someone else feel less alone. If this gets taken down so be it I’ll still find a way to share this cause this is a real lived experience and everyone deserves to feel hope again. To feel familiar in their own skin. It is possible. 🤍\n\nI’m happy to share photos privately with anyone who’s genuinely interested or going through something similar. I just don’t feel comfortable posting them openly right now. At the end of the day I’m the one who lives in my face every day and I finally feel more happy and confident in it. That’s a blessing in itself and if sharing this helps even one person then I did what I came here to do.",

I still use the same gel and leave-in conditioner for both of these pics.\n\nDamaged my hair by tying it back in a low ponytail and wearing a hat most days for the last couple years, and only doing the full curl routine like twice a week. I also had some significant shedding last year so I got on finasteride and minoxidil earlier this year which is why I think I'm seeing more short flyaways around my scalp than normal. Hair is also way more matte than it used to be.\n\nOutside of just not pulling my hair back as much and as tight by using silk scrunchies instead of tight hair ties, any recommendations for some tweaks to my routine?\n\nRoutine:\n\n* Wash every 6-7 days with Ouidad Cleansing Oil Shampoo.\n   * Every three washes I will instead use Malibu C shampoo with a dab of aussie miracle curls shampoo to cleanse the hardwater and silicons.\n* Condition with Cantu Argan Oil Leave-In Conditioning repair cream and then rinse.\n* 1.5 pumps of Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-In Conditioner.\n* Around 4 pumps of Ouidad Climate Control Gel - I have to use a lot to keep the frizz in check.\n* Scrunch out some of the moisture with a microfiber towel.\n* Diffuse on low heat with Dyson diffuser for about 15-20 minutes to about 70-80% dry.\n* Around 3 hours later carefully crunch out cast with Olaplex Bonding Oil or some Morraconoil Argan Oil (mostly just cup my ends and press it against scalp for a second or two)\n* On days that I want a quicker routine for work if I don't have meetings or presentations, I just swap the gel for some Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream and don't worry about diffusing. Gets me like 70% of the results as above, but with less active time.\n* As needed I deep condition with Ouidad Moisture Lock Mask.\n\nI use a silk pillowcase and I have tried pineappling at night and have even tried a silk beanie, but I have never been able to really refresh my curls to the point I think they look acceptable. One of the reasons I tied it back so much. My hair is fine/medium fine with low density.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

The cleanser kinda works but my skin is still flaky, especially when I put on makeup and looks horribly dry, you can even see my smile lines, the corrector and foundation look patchy. I tried salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid, Apivita mattifying moisturizer, Laroche posay cicablast baume b+ to try to hydrate my skin but nothing really seems to help, not even a hydrating primer before makeup and I have these little bumps almost all over my face, especially my forehead and my cheeks, sometimes on my chin. Sometimes after I had pimples (which usually appear on my cheeks around my jawline) they leave dark spots but not scars as you can see on the pics. I don't know what else to try, I tried so many products during my whole teenage years. Idk if it helps but I also have Iron deficiency. I noticed that food doesn't really affect my skin but I still try to stay away from too greasy food, fast food or sweets like chocolate. I would take any suggestions just pls someone help me I am desperate and I don't know how to treat this anymore",

      "content": "hi all! i've recently been having a lot of trouble finding a moisturizer that would fit my skin concerns. my skin type is kind of strange. i think i have a dry/combination skin type. after i wash my face i will have very dry, rough, and tight skin. if i exfoliate my face won't be as rough but the roughness comes back after about 24 hours. i also do start to get a little oily especially in my t zone and forehead after a few hours. but my skin generally stays rough and dry even when the oiliness starts, it's like it just sits on top of my skin. i'm also very prone to blackheads and i occasionally will get random large, deep, under the skin pimples that are inflamed and painful.\n\nif anyone has any good recommendations for a moisturizer that would work for me it would be so appreciated. something that would be deeply hydrating and moisturizing for my dryness and roughness but wouldn't make me oily or give me blackheads. i'm definitely open to anything, and i especially love korean/japanese skincare. preferably less than $50 but if i have to go over to get results so be it. \n\nthank you guys for any help!!",

I get small out breaks I have larger pores on my nose I’d like to get rid of and I have semi frequent outbreaks on my chin. I feel like I have dry skin but my chin is oily or maybe a combo of both dry and oily.\n\nThe only skin care I have ever done is occasional wash with ceraVe face wash then I follow it with bare minerals combo control. And by occasional I mean once every couple of months. (I know not great) I would like some anti aging products, I know I should be wearing sunscreen everyday and I would like to get in that habit but my skin was or still is super sensitive. When I go out for hiking or kayaking I use Neutrogena invisible daily defense 60+ and it is okay on my skin but it’s super oily so using it everyday is just not an option.\n\nI got gifted Mary Kay skin care set 10+ years ago and used it then I thought it was great but never bought it again because of the price. I am now in a place where I can buy some products. If I should go the Mary Kay route I can look into it.\n\nI have done some research about aha/bha, tretinoin And moisturizers, and vitamin C and spf. But I’m very confused with all of these and after research I am lost at where to start.\n\nI am an ultra newbie to this so really any skin care. Any product/advice/routine recommendations would help. Thank you!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin?

I have had consistent acne since 5th grade and i'm seriously at a breaking point (21 F). I will say its improved significantly since high school, but I still have issues with texture.\n\nIve been to dermatologists (one being just this month), estheticians for facials (bi-monthly), and have tried so many different products over the years. Im off gluten (gut issues), heavily limit sugar intake, and was dairy free for two years but gave up as it didn't help. My esthetician recently told me I have dry acne and my derm said its probably hormonal.\n\nAfter extractions, my skin is smooth as can be, but then everything clogs right back up two days later. My skin is also clear after the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask, but it wears off after breakfast. My skin typically never stays hydrated throughout the day, and that's where the bumps get the worst. I have never worn foundation because of my skin, but I get deeply insecure of any photos taken up close. I do chronically pick my skin (and have since 5th grade) but my bumps are naturally skin colored. Please note: I do have some blush on this picture as I just took it and I did the Biodance face mask last night.\n\nCurrently my routine is as follows:\n\nAM\n\nFace wash\n\n\\-Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (I've used YTTP, Cerave, Burt's Bee's oil cleanser, and many more but nothing has ever helped. Derm OK'd this one)\n\n\\-Ordinary salicylic acid\n\n\\-(my derm recommended Dapsone Gel 7.5% but I find it too drying)\n\n\\-Pro Youth 10 Hyaluronic Concentrate (bough from facialist)\n\n\\-Tower 28 SOS moisturizer\n\n\\-Elta MD tinted sunscreen\n\nPM\n\n\\-Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n\n\\-Azelaic acid\n\n\\-Pro Youth 10 Hyaluronic Concentrate\n\n\\-Tower 28 SOS moisturizer\n\n\\-the bha peel from ordinary weekly and moisturizing face masks weekly.",

      "title": "Should I not detangle my hair every morning? What do you do?",
      "content": "(I have very thick/dense very wavy hair that borders 2c/3a depending on various factors. It's low porosity, dense, and medium thickness. People say touching my hair is like touching a fur coat)\n\nFor my entire life I've started every day by using a wide toothed comb (when I had shorter shoulder-length hair) or gentle brush (when my hair got long, I use the unbrush) to fully detangle my hair. Every single morning I wake up with very tangled hair and if I don't detangle it immediately it will get matted.\n\nRecently I've realized none of the hair routines I see online ever mention this. They only reference detangling on the wash day routines—and when I research why my hair keeps getting frizzy, damaged, or thinning out with a whole hairball coming out every day in the brush, what I'm seeing is people saying to be low-manip and gentle etc.\n\nSo like, wait, do y'all not detangle/brush/comb your hair on days that aren't wash days??? You just wake up and keep your hair as is??? I just have such a hard time believing this. Even when I had a pixie cut I had to detangle in the morning. What about evenly distributing the oils from your scalp to the ends? Does your scalp not get oily or your ends dry? Are you just washing your hair really frequently?\n\nMy current plan is to upgrade from just a silk pillow case to sleeping in a satin bonnet. But even when I tried sleeping with my hair in braids I would wake up with it tangled and I would need to take the braids out and brush them.\n\nWhat do you do in the morning on non-wash days? Do you brush?\n\n---My current routine---\n\nOn a wash day: I double-cleanse with Naked coconut tumeric curls shampoo then use the Naked coconut tumeric wash out conditioner. Once a week I also use the shea moisture manuka honey masque which I put in my hair after the wash out and then put my hair in a pun for the rest of my shower routine and wash out at the end (including if I'm shaving anywhere that day, after the shaving!)\n\nAfter the shower I apply Miele rosemary mint strengthening leave in conditioner and use my unbrush to brush it through my hair (starting at the ends!!) (side note but I hate how this conditioner smells it reminds me of a portapotty or airplane bathroom and I'm switching to blueberry bliss/pineapple swirl combo soon).\n\nDepending on how much time I have I might micro-plop then diffuse, or fully plop then air dry, or fully plop the diffuse. Lots of scrunching is happening throughout this drying process. My hair loves to retain moisture and will take hours to dry if I just try to air dry and don't do tons of scrunching out water and such.\n\nI used to use Ouai leave in which worked a lot better but it was too expensive so I couldn't afford to keep using it. I hate the Mielle though but I just can't detangle my hair after a shower without using a leave in conditioner",
