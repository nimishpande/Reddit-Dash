You can do anything you want with your hair :D\n\nAs I said yesterday, I haven’t had my hair cut professionally aside from a trim in a decade. I saw this girl on insta (little\\_warren) and I loved her hair! I was in NYC with my boss for a week so I decided to  go to a curly hair salon. I showed them the inspo pic and they totally nailed it. It was pretty expensive but totally worth it. I was there over 2 hours and they washed/cut/styled/dried my hair perfectly. \n\n  \nSalon: Rëzo Hair Salon 226 5th Ave, NYC / Stylist: Fari Feliz\n\n\n\n*Routine:*  \nI never wash my hair more than once a week.\n\nShampoo: TRESemmé Bouncy Curls/\n\nConditioner: Garnier Fructus Hair Filler + Vitamin Cg Strength Repair /\n\nCurly hair brush in the shower / Loreal Professionnel Tecni Art Bouncy &amp; Tender Force 2 on soaking wet hair /\n\nRight after that TréLuxe Hi! Definition Curl Enhancer Styling Gel in the shower before I step out /\n\nMicro Fiber head towel wrap, 15 minutes, no rubbing or twisting hard. Remove towel and air dry 15 minutes with diffuser on hot until 3/4 dry.\n\nUse big clips to gently scrunch and clip the bangs, middle and top back of hair with 3 clips. Leave for 20 minutes. Gently release the clips and scrunch out the cast then a gentle scrunch with Olaplex No7 rubbed into my hands.\n\nI sleep with a silk bonnet with my hair pinned pineapple style up top. I refresh after a couple of days with a fine mist water spray bottle and scrunch. I do that for the rest of the week and maybe touch up with a scrunch of Moroccan Oil rubbed into my hands once or twice a week.\n\nThat’s it!",

      "content": "# I worked 6 years in the hair transplant industry, across 3 different companies, so I’ve seen a lot behind the scenes. I’m not saying every clinic that does these things is bad but if you see several of these at once, be careful.\n\nSome major red flags in my opinion:\n\n1. If they try to sell you overpriced shampoos, vitamins, or serums under the name of “aftercare.” Good aftercare matters, but it shouldn’t be mandatory or ridiculously expensive.\n2. If they offer DHI or FUE like they’re just menu options. They should tell you which technique is actually best for YOU based on your donor area, hair type, and long-term plan. If they just ask you to choose, where are the ethical standards?\n3. If they claim the anesthesia is “completely painless.” Manageable? Yes. Totally painless? That’s marketing.\n4. If you can’t find out who will actually perform the operation beforehand. You shouldn’t meet the team 5 minutes before surgery.\n5. If the clinic does more than 5 surgeries per day. That’s usually a sign of a hair mill.\n6. If they have 1,000+ Google or Trustpilot reviews. Realistically, maybe 5% of patients leave reviews. Numbers like that should make you pause.\n7. If they do 3,000+ DHI grafts in a single day. Possible, yes but graft survival becomes a serious concern.\n8. If they do 5,000+ FUE grafts in one day without using HypoThermosol. Unless you’re extremely lucky, some of those grafts will die.\n9. If they keep bombarding you with messages, pushing you to “decide now.” High-pressure sales tactics have no place in medical decisions.\n10. If they offer massive or “limited-time” discounts. Medical procedures shouldn’t feel like Black Friday sales.\n\nCan a good result still happen despite these red flags?  \nSure. You might also win the lottery this year.\n\nJust don’t trust clinics that promise everything and explain nothing.\n\nHope this helps.",

      "content": "Notes from a skin cosmetologist.\n\nIndian skin tans easily, marks easily, and holds onto pigmentation longer. Ik, it's a little sad. Mostly because our melanin response is very active (thanks to sun + heat + inflammation).\n\nIf you're dealing with tanning, dark spots, or acne marks, here are ingredients that actually work, and (istg this is more important) how they work:\n\n1. Mulberry Extract\nA gentle tyrosinase inhibitor. What this does is it slows the enzyme that makes excess pigment. Good for people who want brightening without irritation.\n\n2. Niacinamide\nDoesn’t lighten melanin!\nInstead, it reduces melanosome transfer, which means less pigment gets passed to the surface layers.\nAmazing for acne marks, PIH\n\n3. Alpha Arbutin\nA stable brightening ingredient that also inhibits tyrosinase, but gradually\nGreat for uneven tone without harshness.\n\n4. Licorice Extract\nContains glabridin + liquiritin. Magical as they are, both work as tyrosinase suppressors + anti-inflammatory... Licorice is giving 😌\nSo it treats dark spots and the inflammation causing them.\n\n5. Centella (Cica)\nMy favourite when it comes to formulating! Not a brightener by itself, but reduces inflammation + oxidative stress, which are major triggers for pigmentation.\n\nBiggest rule for pigmentation :\nREDUCE INFLAMMATION FIRST.\nBrightening only works when the skin is calm.\n\nHope this helps!",

      "content": "(I have very thick/dense very wavy hair that borders 2c/3a depending on various factors. It's low porosity, dense, and medium thickness. People say touching my hair is like touching a fur coat)\n\nFor my entire life I've started every day by using a wide toothed comb (when I had shorter shoulder-length hair) or gentle brush (when my hair got long, I use the unbrush) to fully detangle my hair. Every single morning I wake up with very tangled hair and if I don't detangle it immediately it will get matted.\n\nRecently I've realized none of the hair routines I see online ever mention this. They only reference detangling on the wash day routines—and when I research why my hair keeps getting frizzy, damaged, or thinning out with a whole hairball coming out every day in the brush, what I'm seeing is people saying to be low-manip and gentle etc.\n\nSo like, wait, do y'all not detangle/brush/comb your hair on days that aren't wash days??? You just wake up and keep your hair as is??? I just have such a hard time believing this. Even when I had a pixie cut I had to detangle in the morning. What about evenly distributing the oils from your scalp to the ends? Does your scalp not get oily or your ends dry? Are you just washing your hair really frequently?\n\nMy current plan is to upgrade from just a silk pillow case to sleeping in a satin bonnet. But even when I tried sleeping with my hair in braids I would wake up with it tangled and I would need to take the braids out and brush them.\n\nWhat do you do in the morning on non-wash days? Do you brush?\n\n---My current routine---\n\nOn a wash day: I double-cleanse with Naked coconut tumeric curls shampoo then use the Naked coconut tumeric wash out conditioner. Once a week I also use the shea moisture manuka honey masque which I put in my hair after the wash out and then put my hair in a pun for the rest of my shower routine and wash out at the end (including if I'm shaving anywhere that day, after the shaving!)\n\nAfter the shower I apply Miele rosemary mint strengthening leave in conditioner and use my unbrush to brush it through my hair (starting at the ends!!) (side note but I hate how this conditioner smells it reminds me of a portapotty or airplane bathroom and I'm switching to blueberry bliss/pineapple swirl combo soon).\n\nDepending on how much time I have I might micro-plop then diffuse, or fully plop then air dry, or fully plop the diffuse. Lots of scrunching is happening throughout this drying process. My hair loves to retain moisture and will take hours to dry if I just try to air dry and don't do tons of scrunching out water and such.\n\nI used to use Ouai leave in which worked a lot better but it was too expensive so I couldn't afford to keep using it. I hate the Mielle though but I just can't detangle my hair after a shower without using a leave in conditioner",

However, over the past month, as the colder weather has begun in my region, I've been getting recurring bumps, small whiteheads, and overall redness around my nose and inner cheeks that tends to spread up towards my temples. This cycle happened once already, and my skin is currently improving again after the second time it occurred.\n\nI've started retaking fish oil pills (recommended by my dermatologist during my Accutane course) and have switched to using a heavier cream moisturizer. I've also stopped using my twice-weekly Benzoyl Peroxide cleanser (still using a gentle moisturizing cleanser) and any other harsher actives (topical antibiotic and tretinoin).\n\nAre there any other changes to my routine that you would recommend?

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I shaved a week ago so all the hair is shorter and easier to pick up and lik would not hurt as much but I still struggle to pick them up like they're not too short but the thread isn't picking them up.\nI'd leave my upperlip for a good while because I'm busy with exams or something so they're actually fullu grown.  but I still can't remove them all with the thread, i have to shave after or remove the few ones left by a tweezer.\n\nAm I using a wrong thread? I'm using the normal sewing one.. should I apply something on my face to help? Or does thr thread not pick them all and that's what's normal, like it picks 95% of the hair but not all.\n",

Some areas feel dry or tight, but I still get oily/greasy during the day (especially T-zone). Redness is my main issue — my skin flushes really easily when I’m warm, stressed, or even just touched. It’s not really acne, just redness and flushing.\nMy skin is sensitive and doesn’t like strong actives or heavy products. Foaming cleansers dry me out, rich creams make me greasy, and oil-control products only help for a few hours before the oil comes back worse. Over-cleansing or rubbing my face definitely makes the redness worse.\nRight now my skin seems to do best with very gentle cleansing (sometimes just water in the morning) and calming, barrier-focused products. I’m trying to keep things minimal but I’m unsure if I should be doing more or less, especially during the day.\nIf you have similar reactive / flushing-prone skin (possibly rosacea-leaning?) I’d love to hear what actually helped you long-term.\n\nPlease see the photos for reference ",

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
