You can do anything you want with your hair :D\n\nAs I said yesterday, I haven’t had my hair cut professionally aside from a trim in a decade. I saw this girl on insta (little\\_warren) and I loved her hair! I was in NYC with my boss for a week so I decided to  go to a curly hair salon. I showed them the inspo pic and they totally nailed it. It was pretty expensive but totally worth it. I was there over 2 hours and they washed/cut/styled/dried my hair perfectly. \n\n  \nSalon: Rëzo Hair Salon 226 5th Ave, NYC / Stylist: Fari Feliz\n\n\n\n*Routine:*  \nI never wash my hair more than once a week.\n\nShampoo: TRESemmé Bouncy Curls/\n\nConditioner: Garnier Fructus Hair Filler + Vitamin Cg Strength Repair /\n\nCurly hair brush in the shower / Loreal Professionnel Tecni Art Bouncy &amp; Tender Force 2 on soaking wet hair /\n\nRight after that TréLuxe Hi! Definition Curl Enhancer Styling Gel in the shower before I step out /\n\nMicro Fiber head towel wrap, 15 minutes, no rubbing or twisting hard. Remove towel and air dry 15 minutes with diffuser on hot until 3/4 dry.\n\nUse big clips to gently scrunch and clip the bangs, middle and top back of hair with 3 clips. Leave for 20 minutes. Gently release the clips and scrunch out the cast then a gentle scrunch with Olaplex No7 rubbed into my hands.\n\nI sleep with a silk bonnet with my hair pinned pineapple style up top. I refresh after a couple of days with a fine mist water spray bottle and scrunch. I do that for the rest of the week and maybe touch up with a scrunch of Moroccan Oil rubbed into my hands once or twice a week.\n\nThat’s it!",

      "content": "# I worked 6 years in the hair transplant industry, across 3 different companies, so I’ve seen a lot behind the scenes. I’m not saying every clinic that does these things is bad but if you see several of these at once, be careful.\n\nSome major red flags in my opinion:\n\n1. If they try to sell you overpriced shampoos, vitamins, or serums under the name of “aftercare.” Good aftercare matters, but it shouldn’t be mandatory or ridiculously expensive.\n2. If they offer DHI or FUE like they’re just menu options. They should tell you which technique is actually best for YOU based on your donor area, hair type, and long-term plan. If they just ask you to choose, where are the ethical standards?\n3. If they claim the anesthesia is “completely painless.” Manageable? Yes. Totally painless? That’s marketing.\n4. If you can’t find out who will actually perform the operation beforehand. You shouldn’t meet the team 5 minutes before surgery.\n5. If the clinic does more than 5 surgeries per day. That’s usually a sign of a hair mill.\n6. If they have 1,000+ Google or Trustpilot reviews. Realistically, maybe 5% of patients leave reviews. Numbers like that should make you pause.\n7. If they do 3,000+ DHI grafts in a single day. Possible, yes but graft survival becomes a serious concern.\n8. If they do 5,000+ FUE grafts in one day without using HypoThermosol. Unless you’re extremely lucky, some of those grafts will die.\n9. If they keep bombarding you with messages, pushing you to “decide now.” High-pressure sales tactics have no place in medical decisions.\n10. If they offer massive or “limited-time” discounts. Medical procedures shouldn’t feel like Black Friday sales.\n\nCan a good result still happen despite these red flags?  \nSure. You might also win the lottery this year.\n\nJust don’t trust clinics that promise everything and explain nothing.\n\nHope this helps.",

      "title": "Pigmentation in Indian Skin: Why It Happens + Ingredients That Actually Work",
      "content": "Notes from a skin cosmetologist.\n\nIndian skin tans easily, marks easily, and holds onto pigmentation longer. Ik, it's a little sad. Mostly because our melanin response is very active (thanks to sun + heat + inflammation).\n\nIf you're dealing with tanning, dark spots, or acne marks, here are ingredients that actually work, and (istg this is more important) how they work:\n\n1. Mulberry Extract\nA gentle tyrosinase inhibitor. What this does is it slows the enzyme that makes excess pigment. Good for people who want brightening without irritation.\n\n2. Niacinamide\nDoesn’t lighten melanin!\nInstead, it reduces melanosome transfer, which means less pigment gets passed to the surface layers.\nAmazing for acne marks, PIH\n\n3. Alpha Arbutin\nA stable brightening ingredient that also inhibits tyrosinase, but gradually\nGreat for uneven tone without harshness.\n\n4. Licorice Extract\nContains glabridin + liquiritin. Magical as they are, both work as tyrosinase suppressors + anti-inflammatory... Licorice is giving 😌\nSo it treats dark spots and the inflammation causing them.\n\n5. Centella (Cica)\nMy favourite when it comes to formulating! Not a brightener by itself, but reduces inflammation + oxidative stress, which are major triggers for pigmentation.\n\nBiggest rule for pigmentation :\nREDUCE INFLAMMATION FIRST.\nBrightening only works when the skin is calm.\n\nHope this helps!",

([https://www.thesun.co.uk](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/1255974/wayne-rooneys-two-previous-hair-transplants-appear-to-have-flopped-as-he-prepares-for-euro-2016-with-a-threadbare-rug/))\n\nThese days he pretty clearly uses hair fibres to make it look fuller. If fin was this guaranteed “stop button,” none of that should’ve happened. But it did.\n\nA lot of people here like to say *“well he just didn’t take it consistently”*, but the uncomfortable truth is that fin (and even dut) only slow hair loss, they don’t stop it for everyone. Especially if you’ve got aggressive genetics, all they really do is buy you time. For some guys that’s 10–15 years. For others it’s like… 3–5 years and then the loss just keeps marching on.\n\nRooney started losing early and aggressively. Fin likely helped *slow things down*, but it clearly didn’t freeze his hair forever, even with multiple transplants backing it up. And meds didn't save his native hair from continuing to miniaturise.\n\nAnd it’s not just Rooney. There are plenty of normal, well-documented cases of guys who started early (NW2-ish), stayed on fin for 12 years, and still ended up heavily thinned or basically bald. Here’s one of those documented cases people like to ignore: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WxN5ocR6TU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WxN5ocR6TU)\n\nSo yeah, Rooney isn’t proof that fin “doesn’t work”, but he *is* proof that fin doesn’t work equally well for everyone, aggressive hair loss will often win eventually, and meds mostly delay the inevitable, not stop it.\n\nAnyone pretending otherwise is just coping or hasn’t been on this journey long enough yet on.",

Here is what my skin looks like currently. On a daily basis, I use the CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser (which was the only thing that cleared the hormonal acne I rapidly developed at age 20) and I use it twice a day. Currently, I am using the La Roche Posay Double Repair Facial Moisturizer, admittedly in the morning only. If I use it at night, I’ve found that I always wake up with budding acne. I don’t wear foundation or concealer on a daily basis, and I’m just at my wits end and I don’t even know where to begin to fix this. My skin is oily on my cheeks and forehead, but dry around my nose. I’m getting married soon, and my acne has really become an insecurity of mine. Any ideas? Thank you :)",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

(i sleep with a silk pillow case and a bonnet, and i put my hair into two braids at night.) any advice is appreciated, i just want my curls back &lt;\\\\3",

      "content": "(I have very thick/dense very wavy hair that borders 2c/3a depending on various factors. It's low porosity, dense, and medium thickness. People say touching my hair is like touching a fur coat)\n\nFor my entire life I've started every day by using a wide toothed comb (when I had shorter shoulder-length hair) or gentle brush (when my hair got long, I use the unbrush) to fully detangle my hair. Every single morning I wake up with very tangled hair and if I don't detangle it immediately it will get matted.\n\nRecently I've realized none of the hair routines I see online ever mention this. They only reference detangling on the wash day routines—and when I research why my hair keeps getting frizzy, damaged, or thinning out with a whole hairball coming out every day in the brush, what I'm seeing is people saying to be low-manip and gentle etc.\n\nSo like, wait, do y'all not detangle/brush/comb your hair on days that aren't wash days??? You just wake up and keep your hair as is??? I just have such a hard time believing this. Even when I had a pixie cut I had to detangle in the morning. What about evenly distributing the oils from your scalp to the ends? Does your scalp not get oily or your ends dry? Are you just washing your hair really frequently?\n\nMy current plan is to upgrade from just a silk pillow case to sleeping in a satin bonnet. But even when I tried sleeping with my hair in braids I would wake up with it tangled and I would need to take the braids out and brush them.\n\nWhat do you do in the morning on non-wash days? Do you brush?\n\n---My current routine---\n\nOn a wash day: I double-cleanse with Naked coconut tumeric curls shampoo then use the Naked coconut tumeric wash out conditioner. Once a week I also use the shea moisture manuka honey masque which I put in my hair after the wash out and then put my hair in a pun for the rest of my shower routine and wash out at the end (including if I'm shaving anywhere that day, after the shaving!)\n\nAfter the shower I apply Miele rosemary mint strengthening leave in conditioner and use my unbrush to brush it through my hair (starting at the ends!!) (side note but I hate how this conditioner smells it reminds me of a portapotty or airplane bathroom and I'm switching to blueberry bliss/pineapple swirl combo soon).\n\nDepending on how much time I have I might micro-plop then diffuse, or fully plop then air dry, or fully plop the diffuse. Lots of scrunching is happening throughout this drying process. My hair loves to retain moisture and will take hours to dry if I just try to air dry and don't do tons of scrunching out water and such.\n\nI used to use Ouai leave in which worked a lot better but it was too expensive so I couldn't afford to keep using it. I hate the Mielle though but I just can't detangle my hair after a shower without using a leave in conditioner",

The cleanser kinda works but my skin is still flaky, especially when I put on makeup and looks horribly dry, you can even see my smile lines, the corrector and foundation look patchy. I tried salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid, Apivita mattifying moisturizer, Laroche posay cicablast baume b+ to try to hydrate my skin but nothing really seems to help, not even a hydrating primer before makeup and I have these little bumps almost all over my face, especially my forehead and my cheeks, sometimes on my chin. Sometimes after I had pimples (which usually appear on my cheeks around my jawline) they leave dark spots but not scars as you can see on the pics. I don't know what else to try, I tried so many products during my whole teenage years. Idk if it helps but I also have Iron deficiency. I noticed that food doesn't really affect my skin but I still try to stay away from too greasy food, fast food or sweets like chocolate. I would take any suggestions just pls someone help me I am desperate and I don't know how to treat this anymore",

I get small out breaks I have larger pores on my nose I’d like to get rid of and I have semi frequent outbreaks on my chin. I feel like I have dry skin but my chin is oily or maybe a combo of both dry and oily.\n\nThe only skin care I have ever done is occasional wash with ceraVe face wash then I follow it with bare minerals combo control. And by occasional I mean once every couple of months. (I know not great) I would like some anti aging products, I know I should be wearing sunscreen everyday and I would like to get in that habit but my skin was or still is super sensitive. When I go out for hiking or kayaking I use Neutrogena invisible daily defense 60+ and it is okay on my skin but it’s super oily so using it everyday is just not an option.\n\nI got gifted Mary Kay skin care set 10+ years ago and used it then I thought it was great but never bought it again because of the price. I am now in a place where I can buy some products. If I should go the Mary Kay route I can look into it.\n\nI have done some research about aha/bha, tretinoin And moisturizers, and vitamin C and spf. But I’m very confused with all of these and after research I am lost at where to start.\n\nI am an ultra newbie to this so really any skin care. Any product/advice/routine recommendations would help.

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
