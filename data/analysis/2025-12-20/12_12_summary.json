      "content": "Notes from a skin cosmetologist.\n\nIndian skin tans easily, marks easily, and holds onto pigmentation longer. Ik, it's a little sad. Mostly because our melanin response is very active (thanks to sun + heat + inflammation).\n\nIf you're dealing with tanning, dark spots, or acne marks, here are ingredients that actually work, and (istg this is more important) how they work:\n\n1. Mulberry Extract\nA gentle tyrosinase inhibitor. What this does is it slows the enzyme that makes excess pigment. Good for people who want brightening without irritation.\n\n2. Niacinamide\nDoesn’t lighten melanin!\nInstead, it reduces melanosome transfer, which means less pigment gets passed to the surface layers.\nAmazing for acne marks, PIH\n\n3. Alpha Arbutin\nA stable brightening ingredient that also inhibits tyrosinase, but gradually\nGreat for uneven tone without harshness.\n\n4. Licorice Extract\nContains glabridin + liquiritin. Magical as they are, both work as tyrosinase suppressors + anti-inflammatory... Licorice is giving 😌\nSo it treats dark spots and the inflammation causing them.\n\n5. Centella (Cica)\nMy favourite when it comes to formulating! Not a brightener by itself, but reduces inflammation + oxidative stress, which are major triggers for pigmentation.\n\nBiggest rule for pigmentation :\nREDUCE INFLAMMATION FIRST.\nBrightening only works when the skin is calm.\n\nHope this helps!",

      "content": "I see so much negativity about DUT. I had a hair transplant in 2019, and it fixed what I wanted it to at the time, but I was still diffusely thinned. I had never even heard about finasteride until the surgeon told me to get on it immediately, and ideally delay the surgery. I declined delaying it as I had travelled to Turkey. However, I got on it as soon as I got home. \n\nAfter going on fin for 3 to 4 months, I realised my hair was no longer brittle. My hair grew back nicely in the transplant area and all my hair felt less brittle. In 2023, I was happy and added oral minoxidil to the mix. I definitely felt some more thickness after the first shed, but not as much as I had hoped for.\n\nAbout 5 months ago, I added dutasteride to the mix three times a week, still taking the full dose of fin to try and avoid a shed. I am not quite sure why, but adding this has had an absolutely insane effect on my hair. I am in my 40s and have been thinning since I was 17. I would say my hair is now thicker than when I was 18. Loads of small hairs.\n\nAt the barbers today, I looked in the mirror and with my wet hair I could not see any scalp. I honestly cannot remember the last time I saw that. I have come home and shone my phone light on my scalp looking in the mirror and there are so many new short hairs with fresh regrowth. I was planning to ditch fin after six months, but I might just keep this stack now as it is working so well.\n\nI just wanted to give a perspective from someone who has taken fin and min for a long time, and the thing that worked the most in the mix several years later has been Dutasteride.\n",

I planned to buy Azelaic Acid 10% and Niacinamide 5% as separate serums to target PIH/PIE and occasional acne, but buying them separately is bit expensive. Then I found this product, which has almost the same ingredients and ratios I was looking for, combined in one cream. But I’ve never used this brand before, so I’m a little skeptical about effectiveness and formulation quality. Would you recommend this over buying azelaic and niacinamide separately?",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

I'm also struggling with bigger pores and have started using 2% BHA in the evenings and niacinamide in the mornings, no real change yet. What else could I do or try to look better, tidier, healthier? Thankful for all suggestions.",

I just started using La Roche Posay Purifying Foaming Cleanser and I don’t know how I feel about it yet but it does make my skin feel clean\n\n\\-Oil cleanser when I wear makeup: softymo speedy cleansing oil or house of hur purifying cleansing balm (recently bought)\n\n\\-Moisturizer: soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream\n\n\\-Paula’s choice 2% BHA: typically 4-5 days a week. I had high hopes for this one but I feel like it hasn’t done much for me. Never really helps with my occasional acne. It does make me look shinier on the days I use it which I don’t hate \n\n\\-Used to use the ordinary Niacinamide serum which I liked. I will probably start using this again\n\n\\-Sunscreen: skin 1004 Hyalu-sica water fit sun serum\n\nI’m not sure if I’ve been doing something wrong, but exfoliants haven’t ever helped much with the appearance of my pores, even stronger exfoliants like the deep red aha/bha serum from the ordinary. Oil cleansing has helped me the most, but there is still a lot of room for improvement",
