My skin is dry and sensitive, and lately it feels like everything irritates it.\n\nI didn’t change makeup, but I tried multiple home remedies (aloe, rose water, ice, etc.) and now I feel my skin barrier is messed up. New bumps are coming even when I’m not applying anything.\n\nI’ve currently stopped experimenting and I’m only:\n\t•\tUsing a gentle cleanser\n\t•\tMoisturiser\n\t•\tNo actives, no masks\nHas anyone faced something similar?\n\t•\tHow long did it take for your skin to calm down?\n\t•\tDid doing less actually help?\n\t•\tAny calming tips that don’t involve strong products?\n\nWould really appreciate personal experiences 🤍",

      "title": "[Product Question] APLB Ferulic Adic Vitamin C serum ascorbic acid content?",
      "content": "Hi!\n\nI've tried out my fair share of vitamin C serums and have had concerns of some kind with all of them - a lot of them about shelf life/oxidation/stability and/or price, effectivity or other ingredients included. I remember trying serums from a Finnish brand called Murumuru (my first one some years ago), Purito's Pure Vitamin C Serum and COSRX's The Vitamin C 23 Serum before settling for Beauty of Joseon's Light On Centella + Vita C Serum, as the earlier ones oxidized faster than I could blink (I don't remember having any adverse reactions to other than maybe the first). I generally enjoyed using the BoJ serum and it at least felt like it stayed unoxidized throughout the bottle, so I finally got a good bang for my buck.\n\nHowever, I've recently got increasingly annoyed about pilling (I have sensory sensitivities) and have phased out products containing silicone to ease that, which the BoJ serum sadly contains. Earlier this year I heard positive things about mixing vitamin C and ferulic acid together and bought the APLB serum as my next vitamin C serum as I was interested to try out the combination and it is affordable.\n\nAffordability brings its own suspicions and I've heard mixed opinions on APLB, or rather the amount of active ingredients they actually use behind their scientific-sounding concentrates or whatever those are (like 46.7% of Ferul Vita Cen™ containing ferulic acid, vitamin C and centella asiatica). I've been using the serum for maybe a couple/a few months now and I can't say I've noticed anything for better or worse. I acknowledge that I can be impatient with skin care and I want to see results at least during the time I use up one product, for which there is still time with the serum.\n\nStill, I was wondering if there is any way to figure out the ascorbic acid content? I've tried to \"research\" vitamin C lately and yesterday I watched a video by Doctor Dray where she mentioned that in order for vitamin C to work it (ascorbic acid) should be at a concentration of at least 8 %, which made me wonder if the APLB serum gets anywhere near that. I have my doubts, but could anyone help me out?\n\nI also appreciate any vitamin C recommendations for serums that stay usable/effective for the time it takes to use up a bottle of it. I use vitamin C every morning. Preferably in the price range the ones I mentioned represent. Or should I try to get past my discomfort (because of pilling) and go back to the BoJ serum since I liked it and I feel like it worked for my skin?\n\nTLDR: Is there any way to figure out the ascorbic acid content of APLB's Ferulic Acid Vitamin C serum?",

I feel like the reason why is my routine, which goes like this: As I Am rosemary shampoo, and run it through my hair loosely and scrub scalp, As I am rosemary conditioner, and loosely let it through my hair, and then wash through and air dry, and i think this loose washing is leading to the mildew, but if i rake my hands through my hair, it makes my hair frizzy and pulls apart the curls. Does anyone know what I’m doing wrong or if my hair is healthy/how i can treat it better?
