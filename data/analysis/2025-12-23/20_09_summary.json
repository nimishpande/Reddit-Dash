My curls feel way less frizzy in the morning now.\n\nPicture was taken 2 days after washing.\n\n**The Routine:**\n\n* **Wash:** Co-wash with **Hask Detangling Curl Care Conditioner**. I spend a good couple of minutes massaging the scalp to make sure it’s clean, then rinse.\n* Apply **Cantu Curl Cream** to soaking wet hair and scrunch them\n* **L**et it air dry\n* Once it’s completely bone-dry, I Scrunch Out The Crunch to get rid of the cast and make it soft.\n\nThanks to everyone in this community for the tips and the motivation to embrace the curls! I know it's a pretty basic routine and theres definitely space to improve but it works for me.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Years of constant sun exposure without a lick of sunscreen has turned my visible skin (face/arms) a deep, dark black. The contrast is crazy because my inner body is still naturally white. It’s a \"perma-tan\" that’s been baked in for ten years.\nI’m also dealing with oily skin and deep acne scars. To be honest, I’m way too introverted and under-confident to go see a dermatologist in person right now. I want to try and fix this myself at home first while I start my New Year's resolution of getting physically active.\nMy Planned \"Starter Pack\":\n * Glycolic Acid\n * Vitamin C Serum\n * Kojic Acid\n * Sunscreen &amp; Moisturizer\nCan you guys help a brown brother out with some guidance?\n * The Routine: How do I actually use these? I’m clueless about what goes first and what shouldn't be mixed.\n * The \"Decade\" Factor: Since this is 10+ years of neglect, how long should I realistically wait to see my natural skin tone start to peek through?\n * The Scars: Will these products help with deep scarring, or am I wasting my time without professional help?\n * The \"Gym\" Factor: Since I'm starting to work out, when should I do this routine? Before or after the gym?\nI’m tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. Any advice or encouragement would mean the world. Thanks, guys.",

      "content": " Help a brown brother out: Yo everyone, I’m making this post because 2026 is the year I finally stop hiding and get my life together.\nI’ve spent more than a decade being completely negligent with my skin. Years of constant sun exposure without a lick of sunscreen has turned my visible skin (face/arms) a deep, dark black. The contrast is crazy because my inner body is still naturally white/fair. It’s a \"perma-tan\" that’s been baked in for ten years.\nI’m also dealing with oily skin and deep acne scars. To be honest, I’m way too introverted and under-confident to go see a dermatologist in person right now. I want to try and fix this myself at home first while I start my New Year's resolution of getting physically active.\nMy Planned \"Starter Pack\":\n * Glycolic Acid\n * Vitamin C Serum\n * Kojic Acid\n * Sunscreen &amp; Moisturizer\nCan you guys help a brown brother out with some guidance?\n * The Routine: How do I actually use these? I’m clueless about what goes first and what shouldn't be mixed.\n * The \"Decade\" Factor: Since this is 10+ years of neglect, how long should I realistically wait to see my natural skin tone start to peek through?\n * The Scars: Will these products help with deep scarring, or am I wasting my time without professional help?\n * The \"Gym\" Factor: Since I'm starting to work out, when should I do this routine? Before or after the gym?\nI’m tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. Any advice or encouragement would mean the world. Thanks, guys.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I still did not apply moisturizer after this because I thought \"If my skin doesnt feel tight, then it isnt dry\".\n\nPM: Same routine as Mid Afternoon with no moisturizer.\n\n  \nAnyways, my sister who recently came home from college for the holidays mentioned that I have destroyed my skin barrier because I never moisturized even after such harsh chemicals like Benzoyl Peroxide.\n\nMy skin (as seen in pictures) seems to be inflammed. It doesnt consist of white heads but just is red under the skin barrier.\n\nAfter researching I have realized I messed my skin up big time.\n\nSo here is my NEW skincare routine and I would greatly appreciate any advice or changes to it\n\n\n\nAM: Wash face with CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser, apply 10% Azelaic Acid Serum, moisturize with CeraVe SPF 50\n\nPM: Wash face with EITHER CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser OR PanOxyl (Benzoyl Peroxide) and then apply 10% Azelaic Acid Serum, apply CeraVe PM facial mositurizer.\n\n  \nIs this too harsh of a skincare routine?

Rarely the front plays nice and decides to curl like in the last pic, but I don’t know what the magic formula is to make it happen more often.\n\nFor my routine was using Kevin Murphy hydration set, but I feel like the shampoo didn’t really clean my hair, and it’s also kinda expensive 😬 I also spray in bb invisible oil after showering and sometimes use ouidad’s vitacurl and let it air dry (I haven’t gotten a diffuser for my blow dryer yet). \n\nAnyway, any help would be so appreciated 🙏",

My face also stopped being so tight after washing. Good to mention that I used to double cleanse day and night. I’ll still get those flakes but rarely, so I think I might have combination skin because my jawline and nose get pretty oily fast.\n\nI recently stopped using the exfoliating wash on the left every day and only use it once a week now. I wash my face morning and night with CeraVe, and I use the jojoba oil to remove makeup (I rarely use makeup anymore) and I attempted to oil grit to reduce the appearance of sebaceous filaments on my nose. I use the glycolic pads after washing (I’m switching back over to The Ordinary’s version so I’m not wasting so much with these pads). Niacinamide goes on 10 minutes after, then the moisturizer, and finally sunscreen.\n\nAgain, this is all a newer regimen so it hasn’t had too much time to kick in. Any suggestions?

From what I know, seven months isn’t usually enough time to see the full results of an HT.\n\nRight now, I’m using hair fibers to cover the thinning areas, and it looks really good.

I feel like the reason why is my routine, which goes like this: As I Am rosemary shampoo, and run it through my hair loosely and scrub scalp, As I am rosemary conditioner, and loosely let it through my hair, and then wash through and air dry, and i think this loose washing is leading to the mildew, but if i rake my hands through my hair, it makes my hair frizzy and pulls apart the curls. Does anyone know what I’m doing wrong or if my hair is healthy/how i can treat it better?

That being the case, I'm looking for another natural shampoo and conditioner that work well for people with thinning hair. I will add the disclaimer that I'm well aware no shampoo or conditioner actually treat hair loss. That's not what I'm asking here. I just need a good natural (i.e., no SLS, etc.) shampoo and conditioner that aren't egregiously expensive but that are specifically not problematic to those with thinning hair. If they add noticeable volume and fullness that's great, but most important are the ingredients and overall quality. I realize every scalp is different so opinions are subjective, but it would be great to have some recommendations. Yes, I have looked through the wiki and tried to do other research in this sub. There are just so many products out there, new ones come out all the time and old favorites are sadly prone to formula changes, so any recommendations to help narrow the field would be much appreciated!",

So far I’ve been told to keep everything totally dry, switch to beeswax lip balm, eat more vitamin C, and switch toothpaste brands. I’ve tried using diaper rash cream (which is my usual go-to for things like pimples) but it doesn’t help much. Does anyone have any experience or product recommendations? I live in a cold and humid country. Thank you so much 💙",

It’s been like this for years and I have been incredibly insecure, I haven’t been able to get a proper fringe due to me having a cowlick and it just bouncing back. I despise the look of heavy fringes too. I just want to know if there’s any treatments I can do to make my hair grow back in the place it was lost years ago.
