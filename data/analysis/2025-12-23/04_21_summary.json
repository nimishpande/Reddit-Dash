Super over processed, barely curling, and generally weighing my hair down. I went and cut some layers into my hair (I am a hairstylist but I am also a lot more haphazard with my own hair), trying to avoid the perimeter as much as possible to preserve length. It brought a lot of the spring factor back and fixed the wonky shape that was happening too. So yeah, whether you cut it yourself or get someone else to do it- let go of those dead ends. \n\nRoutine (pic 2):\nWash with Innersense clarity hairbath and hydrating cream conditioner. Section into top and bottom, add the doux pop lock glaze on soaking wet hair. Brush through with a 3 row denman comb (not the brush, it’s different). Scrunch, diffuse. ",

I had chemical straightening before but it just made my hair frizz out. \n\nMy routine is hair mask (usually Garnier papaya hair food or Aussie curls)\nShampoo with noughty shampoo and a silicone scalp scrubber thing. Noughty conditioner too. \nRinse that out then put leave in conditioner in. Right now im using one called bond plex.\nNoughty curl cream, UG hair gel. Wait until its hard, diffuse until it feels like hair again then put hair serum on it. I like the grapeseed one from the body shop as others felt too heavy.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

Until last year, when I developed this persistent hormonal acne around the mouth. \n\nI have tried benzyl peroxide, deoxycycline, adapalene, spearmint tea, zinc supplements, silk pillowcases, changing toothpaste brands, etc, but nothing has worked. The antibiotics did work while I was on them but the problem came right back. I'm limited on what other things I can try since I have other health conditions, so going back on accutane etc isn't an option. Not on birth control or any contraception that could be causing it.\n\nCurrently have a minimal routine of cerave blemish control cleanser and the standard moisturiser, with spf in the mornings and adapalene in the evenings.\n\nany advice on what could have caused the issue and what could help would be appreciated. acne followed big life transition (graduating masters and moving home from the UK to NZ) which could be a factor.",

I feel like the reason why is my routine, which goes like this: As I Am rosemary shampoo, and run it through my hair loosely and scrub scalp, As I am rosemary conditioner, and loosely let it through my hair, and then wash through and air dry, and i think this loose washing is leading to the mildew, but if i rake my hands through my hair, it makes my hair frizzy and pulls apart the curls. Does anyone know what I’m doing wrong or if my hair is healthy/how i can treat it better?

The last few haircuts I've had have been really bomb!! Despite this, my hair always looks so bad. It's not damaged, I never use heat or straighten my hair, I don't colour or bleach it. So it should be very healthy but it's always frizzy af!\n\nI have always just let my hair air dry, or blow-dried it with a regular hair dryer on low (which is terrible), because I could never figure out how to use a diffuser!! I finally decided to invest in the shark flexstyle hair dryer and it comes with a diffuser attachment... Omg it's a game changer. My curls have never looked better! Air drying always left my hair so flat and simultaneously frizzy, and now I have nice juicy voluminous curls! It's amazing. I definitely recommend the shark or whatever kind of fancy diffuser you're looking at getting! People complain that the shark is loud, but honestly, as a sound-sensitive person, it really isn't that bad as long as you're not aiming it directly into your ear haha.\n\n*(Routine: shampoo (Ouai detox), conditioner (AG curl fresh), out of the shower I spray the innate life's neroli primer on my hair, then used the mielle Rosemary mint cream, and AG CARE mousse-gel. Then diffused with shark. Amazing)*",

      "content": "I live in a very humid, rainy climate and my curls always turn out pretty defined, and even more defined a day or two after washing. But I’m home for Christmas in a very dry, cold climate and after washing and diffusing, the curls were so loose, the next day it was basically straight lol. I know humidity can make curly hair curlier, but is there nothing I can do to replicate the results in a dryer climate? Or is what I’m seeing in this dryer climate more true to my actual curl pattern? It’s seriously making me wonder if I even have curly hair. \n\nI just recently started embracing my natural hair so this is my first time back at home styling my curly hair. \n\nRoutine: \n1. Shampoo and conditioner - dove curl repair \n2. I don’t use a leave in as I have fine hair and I find it’s too much product for it. I use the Marc Anthony strictly curls curl cream and the umberto Giannini scrunching jelly (at home I usually use a mouse as well, but I didn’t bring it with me)\n3. I style in two sections, my bottom layer first and then my crown. I apply the cream, then gel, style with my bounce define brush and scrunch. I do the same for the top layer\n4. I use a cotton tshirt for the excess water and then diffuse until fully dry and scrunch once more with an oil \n\nHeres a picture of what my hair typically looks like. \n",

I’m going to be living in Korea for a year next year and as you all know the skin treatments there are next level and way cheaper than in the West! I want to do some more intensive treatments as well as some maintenance treatments while i’m there in order to address some issues I have with my skin. I’m 22yo if it helps. I’ve thought about rejuran and potenza to address hyperpigmentation and indents from acne but not sure if they’re the best to address these issues. \n\nConcerns:\n- hyperpigmentation (PIH/PIE) from acne and sun freckles (I wear sunscreen daily and reapply especially during summers but some sun freckles have been here since I was young and I seem to have developed more in the recent years… not sure why.)\n- skin indents from acne \n(i have some indentation in my skin from acne scars? but they’re not too deep like how it can be with some extreme acne scars but I’d like to reduce the appearance of the indents if possible as some of them it makes the spot look dark like freckles or acne hyperpigmentation)\n- redness \n(i get red in some spots contributed by PIE i believe. i also have some broken capillaries around my nose which make it always red)\n- clogged pores \n(my breakouts now always start off with a closed comedone before erupting into a red fat pimple. I do use AHAs and BHAs throughout the week but I can’t seem to avoid the comedones)\n\nThanks for the read and hopefully reply :)\n\n \n",

Yes, 8 months.\n\nI tried tons of moisturizers ranging from Vanicream to vaseline, to $80 moisturizers. I spent thousands on facials, I switched to clean hair care, and could not be out in the sun, use SPF, or wear makeup for 8 months because it was causing itchy dermatitis reactions that would erupt into hundreds of white heads. I was heart broken. Nothing worked. I was prescribed antibiotics multiple times and different creams, but I knew in my heart what my skin needed was moisture.\n\nI stumbled upon EpiCeram and got it from BlinkRx for only $39. In 5 days my skin is noticeably different. It's supple, it's literally HEALING FINALLY. It looks AMAZING.\n\nIf anyone out there has any severe skin issue, please get this stuff. It saved me!!\n\n[After SPF use, would start like this than break out into white heads everywhere.](https://preview.redd.it/qsj61rgfnv8g1.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ebed1893e628cbf706a108344e3884617991750)",

I didn’t wash my face and I used a cetaphil lotion (for sensitive skin). Face started getting red and burning a tad. Any tips? Do I go to the doctor and ask for help?",

Once I realised this wrinkle was there I started wondering why (as I’m generally too young to start developing wrinkles from age) then I became more aware of my facial movements etc. I’ve had bad headaches and I also have photosensitivity so I squinted a lot without even realising it and I think that’s what caused this wrinkle as it’s the exact same spot as where the wrinkle is when I relax my face after squinting. It also feels tight in my forehead sometimes when I’m actively trying not to squint, I don’t know why that is. I try not to squint and I wear sunglasses now to help prevent it getting worse, but basically is there anything I can do to minimise it? I know everyone says Botox but I can’t really afford that atm so I’m looking for something else to at least stop it from getting worse even if it can’t minimise it. It’s really annoying me, So any suggestions would be appreciated.",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

      "content": "Hi All! I’m a 27yo F. I’ve struggled with skin picking since I was in high school. I particularly struggle with cysts because they’re so deep and I can feel them throughout the day. I’ve had picking sessions so bad that I’m left with open wounds for weeks. It’s bad.\n\nSpironolactone has helped my skin a TON! I’ve had ups and downs, but overall I’m in a decent spot. Like most people, when I menstruate, my skin breaks out. Usually with those deep cystic ones. Even though I know it’ll only last a week or so, I struggle to keep my hands away…until recently.\n\nMy friend introduced me to the high frequency wand. This is the one I got on Amazon: https://a.co/d/4JODiWG\n\nI don’t totally understand how it works, but the energy helps kill bacteria and reduce inflammation. The part that helps me most though…and this will sound crazy to anyone who doesn’t struggle with picking…is that it slightly hurts. I feel ashamed to say that part of my picking problem is that it’s rooted in self harm. I don’t struggle with self harm in any other way, but picking is definitely my version of wanting a release and almost this weird twisted desire to punish my skin for breaking out. It’s bizarre. I’m in therapy lol.\n\nLong story short. This lil zappy wand is great because…\n\n1.\t⁠It feels proactive\n\n2.\t⁠It hurts just enough to curb my picking cravings\n\n3.\t⁠No scarring or big open wounds!!\n\nHas anyone else tried these things? I really think this could be a turning point for me!",
