My curls feel way less frizzy in the morning now.\n\nPicture was taken 2 days after washing.\n\n**The Routine:**\n\n* **Wash:** Co-wash with **Hask Detangling Curl Care Conditioner**. I spend a good couple of minutes massaging the scalp to make sure it’s clean, then rinse.\n* Apply **Cantu Curl Cream** to soaking wet hair and scrunch them\n* **L**et it air dry\n* Once it’s completely bone-dry, I Scrunch Out The Crunch to get rid of the cast and make it soft.\n\nThanks to everyone in this community for the tips and the motivation to embrace the curls! I know it's a pretty basic routine and theres definitely space to improve but it works for me.",

I’m on Day 6 after getting them cauterized and the healing process seems slow and I wonder if I’m doing something wrong with the aftercare.\n\nI only had a few removed to test out the process, but they were larger and raised and maybe that’s the issue? For aftercare, my derm recommended gentle cleanser twice per day and to moisturize with vaseline until the scabs fall off, only switching over to sunscreen once the skin is healed. After the appointment, the areas started to darken later that day which I expected but they haven't formed a hard scab yet and it's been almost a week. Each dpn lesion has been swollen and a bit red. No sign of anything drying out due to the vaseline. I’m only using a thin layer, but wonder if I should switch back to using my normal gel moisturizer which is lighter (Vanicream daily moisturizer).\n\nNot sure whether it’s better to keep the area very moisturized with an occlusive like vaseline vs let it to dry out a bit so that full scabbing can start. If anyone has any advice or experiences, would really appreciate it. Thanks!",

I love how long it is, but I have a flew glaring issues. It is SO FRIZZY and dull omg.\n\n1. When I air dry it, it is wavy but of course I have to BRUSH IT which ends in poofy frizzy straight(ish) horror.\n2. When I use a blow dry brush (Revlon) it turns out flat and still frizzy.\n3. When I curl it with a wand or iron, I clip them in the curl position and leave that in for 30+ mins and then hair spray and then I brush them out and they fall straighter and frizzier then anything omg.\n4. I have tried overnight curls and brush out and they come out STRAIGHT AND FRIZZY.\n5. My hair is SUPER tangly at all times. Like genuinely I could brush it and then wait 10 seconds and brush it again and I will get tension. I have tried a few detanglers, I use Olaplex, etc.\n\nBasically, my hair looks minimally voluminous but overall not glossy at all (even when I add Kerastase night serum, or leave in conditioner, or oil!) and super frizzy and weird poofy straight.

I feel like the reason why is my routine, which goes like this: As I Am rosemary shampoo, and run it through my hair loosely and scrub scalp, As I am rosemary conditioner, and loosely let it through my hair, and then wash through and air dry, and i think this loose washing is leading to the mildew, but if i rake my hands through my hair, it makes my hair frizzy and pulls apart the curls. Does anyone know what I’m doing wrong or if my hair is healthy/how i can treat it better?

But I’m home for Christmas in a very dry, cold climate and after washing and diffusing, the curls were so loose, the next day it was basically straight lol. I know humidity can make curly hair curlier, but is there nothing I can do to replicate the results in a dryer climate? Or is what I’m seeing in this dryer climate more true to my actual curl pattern? It’s seriously making me wonder if I even have curly hair. \n\nI just recently started embracing my natural hair so this is my first time back at home styling my curly hair. \n\nRoutine: \n1. Shampoo and conditioner - dove curl repair \n2. I don’t use a leave in as I have fine hair and I find it’s too much product for it. I use the Marc Anthony strictly curls curl cream and the umberto Giannini scrunching jelly (at home I usually use a mouse as well, but I didn’t bring it with me)\n3. I style in two sections, my bottom layer first and then my crown. I apply the cream, then gel, style with my bounce define brush and scrunch. I do the same for the top layer\n4. I use a cotton tshirt for the excess water and then diffuse until fully dry and scrunch once more with an oil \n\nHeres a picture of what my hair typically looks like. \n",
