      "content": "I have noticed that a lot of brands are reformulating their cool toned products lately, and the new formulas all end up pulling super warm. A few examples:\n\n- Nars Orgasm is now just orange/peach glitter with no pink color base\n- Mac reformulated lipsticks such as Angel, Creme Cup, etc. that now are warm nudes that pull orange \n- OPI just completely discontinued Russian Navy (we ride at dawn) \n- No new eyeshadow palettes include a shade/shades of blue or emerald green like they did in the 2016 eyeshadow palette era \n\nThe excuse being given a lot of places is that there is a blue pigment shortage or an increase in costs of blue pigments in the cosmetic industry, so they are reformulating their cool products to no longer be cool. Anyone who loves a baby pink lipstick or gloss can feel my pain in that I can spend 45 min in Sephora swatching all the pink glosses in the store and can’t find a good frosty baby pink like the ones I loved years ago. \n\nI even saw a TikTok recently of a girl who pulled some 90’s L’Oréal lipsticks that were all super cool funky 90’s style cool toned browns and nudes, and purchased the modern day versions which were the exact same shades. She put the OG on half her lip and the new one on the other half, and the new versions were all almost totally sheer and orange as hell. \n\nSo what’s really going on? I’ve seen articles saying there is in fact NOT a shortage of blue pigment. These are multi-billion dollar corporations for God’s sake, are we supposed to believe LOREAL can’t afford the color blue? \n\nI’ve tried to deep dive to see what I can find about who owns these pigment companies and can’t find anything meaningful, but all I can say is that I’m pissed lol. \n\nDoes anyone have any insight here??

      "content": "24M, I noticed some thinning on my crown summer of 2024. Convinced myself it was TE, it kept getting worse. It was only noticeable when I had wet hair. I got a haircut in February 2025, it was so noticeable that I couldn’t deny that I was balding anymore and hopped on the meds. I had done quite a bit of research and I decided to use the Hims min+fin chewable, as I wanted to try out oral minox. Kind of wish I had just tried fin alone first but I’m not complaining. \n\nMonth 1 and 2 my hair was coming out in clumps in the shower and I lost a lot of hope and was super stressed and sad. Easier said than done, but you just gotta relax and trust the process. I wore a ton of hats but it got to the point where even with my best combover attempts it was just showing. I think by month 3 the length of my hair helped cover but i definitely noticed an increase in volume. \n\nBy months 4-5 I really never saw the bald spot anymore, even under direct light. Went ahead and got my hair cut and I couldn’t see it still. The insane shedding had stopped. It’s been pretty slowly getting even better even up until now (10 months)\n\nThe one thing not noted in the pictures is my hairline. I’ve always had a bad hairline. I didn’t really realize how much it thinned, but I’ve actually gotten compliments from people like “are you using new hair product? Your hair is so thick in the front!” And looking back at older pictures I regrew a lot of volume in the front. \n\nI only did fin+min. I did daily scalp massages for maybe a month or two, don’t know if they helped but they definitely added some peace of mind. Results didn’t change after I stopped. I also got into working out/eating good and I’m not sure if that helps at all but I would recommend as it helps with the confidence.\n\nNo sides. I was actually very scared of them. The first time I had sex after starting I was so fixated on the idea I wouldn’t be able to maintain an erection that I almost didn’t maintain an erection. But once I was able to do it once, I realized I didn’t have an issue and was good. Honestly the confidence gained from getting my hair back actually seems to have boosted sex drive. I do think nocebo is a real thing and you gotta just not focus on what you think is gonna go wrong.\n\nI highly recommend giving the medication a try, it’s okay to be bald, but I just wanted to exhaust all options before I had to commit to it and I am so glad I tried this.

The last few haircuts I've had have been really bomb!! Despite this, my hair always looks so bad. It's not damaged, I never use heat or straighten my hair, I don't colour or bleach it. So it should be very healthy but it's always frizzy af!\n\nI have always just let my hair air dry, or blow-dried it with a regular hair dryer on low (which is terrible), because I could never figure out how to use a diffuser!! I finally decided to invest in the shark flexstyle hair dryer and it comes with a diffuser attachment... Omg it's a game changer. My curls have never looked better! Air drying always left my hair so flat and simultaneously frizzy, and now I have nice juicy voluminous curls! It's amazing. I definitely recommend the shark or whatever kind of fancy diffuser you're looking at getting! People complain that the shark is loud, but honestly, as a sound-sensitive person, it really isn't that bad as long as you're not aiming it directly into your ear haha.\n\n*(Routine: shampoo (Ouai detox), conditioner (AG curl fresh), out of the shower I spray the innate life's neroli primer on my hair, then used the mielle Rosemary mint cream, and AG CARE mousse-gel. Then diffused with shark. Amazing)*",

I’m prone to comedones, but I don’t usually get much acne, just occasional small whiteheads. The only time my skin feels truly moisturized is when I use a rich cream or facial oil. I would slather on Aquaphor after using hyaluronic acid and a La Roche-Posay moisturizer because with just the moisturizer &amp; the acid, my skin still didn’t feel hydrated. I’m looking for advice on a routine that could really help, along with moisturizer recommendations.\n\nMy Future Routine [Maybe?)\nsensibio micellar water,\nvanicream facial cleanser,\nbyoma milky toner,\nmandelic acid,\n6 peptide skin booster\n",

I know humidity can make curly hair curlier, but is there nothing I can do to replicate the results in a dryer climate? Or is what I’m seeing in this dryer climate more true to my actual curl pattern? It’s seriously making me wonder if I even have curly hair. \n\nI just recently started embracing my natural hair so this is my first time back at home styling my curly hair. \n\nRoutine: \n1. Shampoo and conditioner - dove curl repair \n2. I don’t use a leave in as I have fine hair and I find it’s too much product for it. I use the Marc Anthony strictly curls curl cream and the umberto Giannini scrunching jelly (at home I usually use a mouse as well, but I didn’t bring it with me)\n3. I style in two sections, my bottom layer first and then my crown. I apply the cream, then gel, style with my bounce define brush and scrunch. I do the same for the top layer\n4. I use a cotton tshirt for the excess water and then diffuse until fully dry and scrunch once more with an oil \n\nHeres a picture of what my hair typically looks like. \n",

Looking for general tips on care and especially looking for advice on styling products. \n\nRoutine:\nMy usual is to wash once or twice a week, condition most days(OGX coconut milk), leave in conditioner(fructis) most days. Im trying to understand what to use to style it. I’ve been using an old fructis palmad but have been having mixed results. Mostly needing to find the line of keeping it out of my face while not looking too greasy or weighing down and flattening my hair. I also have been using a metal wavy hair band when my hair is wet. Letting it dry with that on helps keep the hair out of my face but worried it straightens it out a little too much too. I airdry only and dont want to bother with anything else ",

The only thing that worries me is scalp irritation—especially some redness on my forehead. I want to clarify that I don’t have any itchiness. Sometimes I feel a slight “burning” sensation after applying minoxidil, but it’s by no means unbearable and it doesn't happen everyday.\n\nDespite the irritation, I’d say the stack is working.\n\nDoes anyone know what I could do to reduce the irritation?\n\nI’ve read about:\n\n\\- Diet changes and probiotics. I'll try some supplements. I'm already very fit and don't eat much sugar.\n\n\\- The alcohol in minoxidil — switching to an alcohol-free version might help\n\n\\- Oral minoxidil. My dermatologist actually suggested trying oral minoxidil and topical finasteride due to the irritation and a decrease in libido. But I was not convinced as the current stack is working well.\n\nSo far, my main downsides have been irritation and a slight loss of libido. Nothing major, though.\n\nOne thing to mention is that I probably had scalp irritation even before starting min.",
