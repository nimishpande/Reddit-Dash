I did a lot of research and started using otc Azelaic Acid 10% (Aziderm cream) in the mornings and it has definitely helped with my acne flair up. But it hasn’t done much for the acne marks. Now I also wanted to incorporate Retinol so I’m using the Dot &amp; Key Retionol Ceramide night cream at night along with a gentle moisturiser. There are a ton of recommendations online from Alpha arbutin to kojic acid to vitamin c but i have no idea what to use. Any suggestions keeping my current routine in mind? Or are there any changes you would suggest?",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I'm a 21-year-old guy from Kolkata, and I'm struggling with an insecurity that's single-handedly tied to my skin. I'm dark-skinned with an oily/combination face that tans easily and looks greasy. I don't want to be f@irer; my only goal is to have my face match the lighter, yellow-brown tone of my chest, and to look less oily.\n\nThis isn't just about skincare. It's about how I feel in group photos with my lighter-skinned friends, especially those taken in broad daylight. I look at those pictures and I just feel... dirty, exposed, and I want to disappear. It completely wrecks my confidence and makes me want to avoid situations where I'll be photographed.\n\nI've tried. I use the Plum Green Tea SPF 50 PA++++ sunscreen for oily skin, but it hasn't stopped the tanning or the greasy look. My T-zone is the worst. Based on some previous advice, I've started with a Salicylic Acid 2% + Niacinamide 1.5% cleanser and am about to introduce an Alpha Arbutin serum.\n\nI'm reaching out because I'm tired of feeling this way. I'd be so grateful for any product recommendations or routine tips from this community that could help me achieve a more even tone and control the oil.\n\nFull Disclosure: This text was written by the DeepSeek AI because I was feeling really lazy and asked it to summarize a long conversation where I detailed all these issues. It's captured everything important about my situation. Thanks in advance for your help.",

      "title": "Has anyone seen real results with an acne mark removal gel for old scars?",
      "content": "I suffered from acne as a teenager, and they have left some stubborn marks on my skin. I tried makeup, but it'll make the matter worse since I have sensitive skin, so I searched for a product that would help me fade away these scars. I began searching for gels to remove acne marks. I wasn't sure if I should try new products due to my sensitive skin, and also because countless products were claiming to deliver similar results, and I didn't want to waste time or money. Still, I gave it a shot and did my research before giving it a try, and here's what I found.\n\n\n\nIt turns out that a few ingredients, such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid, nicotinamide, etc, are the best ingredients to remove acne and its scars. These ingredients can kill acne-causing bacteria and control excess oil on your skin. Nicotinamide is a form of vitamin B3 that reduces inflammation, redness, and swelling. By the recommendation of someone I trusted, I used Acnestar acne gel. I used the gel religiously each night, and I wore my sunscreen each morning to protect my skin. In the first few weeks, I didn't notice anything honestly but kept applying it. I also noticed a bit of dryness so I used a moisturiser too. Honestly, I took some time to show results.\n\n\n\nAt around two months, I began to see real change. The newer marks faded the fastest, but I watched some older ones that had been there for years fade as well. It wasn't a drastic overnight transformation, but it was enough of a change that kept me motivated to use the products. I kept my skincare very simple throughout the time, a gentle cleanser, acne removal gel and moisturiser. My skin was calmer and less irritated.\n\n\n\nI felt like the gel was pretty effective for acnemarks. Not all my marks are removed, specifically any pitted or textured scars, but they may require more advanced treatments like microneedling or laser therapy. But in terms of the dark marks and uneven tone, the acne mark removal gel did work for me (I tried AcneStar). If you are struggling with acne marks, I would absolutely suggest giving them a try, but with realistic expectations, consistency, and, of course, don't forget the sunscreen.\n\n",
