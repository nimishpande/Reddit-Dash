      "content": "I’m needing help establishing a better hair routine for my daughter. Currently, we wash her hair on average twice a week. She bathes more than that but just gets her hair wet, so we apply leave in conditioner after. We never brush her hair dry. In the mornings I use water and a little leave in conditioner to style her hair. She usually requests some sort of braid to keep it out of her face. If she wears in down like in the last picture I add a small amount of curl cream. First two pictures show her hair after she’s woken up without styling it. \n\nI’m worried there is product build up and that her hair is just in general too dry. It now feels straw like when I wash it. Is this normal? \n\nI’m thinking I need to use a clarifying shampoo but don’t want to make the dryness worse. \n\nAny recommendations for a clarifying shampoo, how often to use it, and what moisturizing products to use between washes? Bonus if it’s low on fragrance. I don’t love the smell of most strong fragrances. \n\nShould I be getting her a silk pillow case or having her sleep with her hair a certain way? \n\nWe love her curls and want to start from a young age teaching her the proper maintenance. I research online but get overwhelmed with all the different possibilities and would love some guidance on simple routines that have worked for others. ",

      "content": "First off, I know my hair is wavy not curly (please curl police spare me lol). But I can't even post on wavy hair subreddit cause they don't allow any mention of hair type or porosity or density etc. \n\nMy routine: Davines love curl shampoo and conditioner, Ouai leave in, curl products (NYM curl cream, Davines curl mousse, Kaleed (local brand) rice curl gel), scrunch, plop 30mins, diffuse until half dry, air dry. For context I live in high humidity tropical country, hard water, and low porosity hair with high density.\n\nI have tried every routine. I found that only using mousse still makes my hair frizzy (pic 3) and puffy when dry, with low definition on my waves. Mousse and gel gives some hold but never last overnight (pic 4), and I still get halo frizz. Cream and mousse and gel give me the best hold that last me 2 days (pic 5). However, my waves are much tighter when my hair is wet after plopping, and dries with much looser waves. I wonder if I force it to be tighter during products and scrunching? Is there such a thing? If not, any suggestion on how to keep the tight waves when dry? \n\nAlso if anyone has advice on lesser effort for wavy routine that keeps frizz at bay lol. I did wavy hair routine last year for about a month, then quit cause it was too much effort. Went back to only shampoo (not even conditioner), air dry, then claw clip or bun my hair almost all the time. When I need to style my hair, I either used curling iron, or heatless curl overnight that gives me neck pain in the morning. I just got back to do the routine last month and I'm close to quitting again 😭. My hair takes 4-5hrs to air dry completely without products, 6-8hrs to air dry with products on. Diffusing to half dry on low heat takes 1.5 hours, with luck (if it's sunny, 75% humidity), the rest will completely dry in 4hrs. If it's rainy (96% humidity), I'd actually sleep with half dry (scalp area dry) and hope for the best for the rest to dry overnight lol.",

While I realize this is a desirable trait for a lot of people, I'm transmasc and prefer a more gothy aesthetic, so sometimes it starts to bother me.\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for a tinted lip balm, maybe in a light beige or even greenish shade, that would help to minimize the natural color of my lips? A balm or something more sheer and hydrating would be preferred (I live in a desert and should really wear lip balm more anyway) but I'm willing to hear out any suggestions.\n\nSome previous things I've looked at, for a reference: I'm a big fan of Haunting Hues cosmetics, and the Corpse Batty Balm might be what I'm looking for, but I haven't tried it yet. I once tried Abomination Cosmetics' \"Shallows\" Lip Balm (which it doesn't seem they still sell), but I had a lot of problems with the consistency.\n\nThanks for the help!",

An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "So I am learning how to better take care of my hair and I was wondering something. Right now I don't have hard water after moving in August but before that I had like the hardest, grossest water you can imagine. Like chokes a brita in a month bad. Like drink it unfiltered and you get more thirsty bad. So I'm wondering if I would benefit from chelating my hair once or twice to make sure the buildup is gone? My hairs been crazy tempermental and I think this might have something to do with it. I've heard it can make hair seem like its low porosity when its really not but also all my hair is new as of the past year and a half so it doesn't have any heat damage or color treatments. Its very fine and coily and dense where its had the chance to fill in but thin on top since that is still working on growing in\n\n  \nRoutine as of now:\n\nInnersense Detox clarifying shampoo once every 2 weeks\n\nNot your Mothers curly hair shampoo\n\nOuidad Curl Quench conditioner\n\nInnersense I create Hold Gel for styling like maybe one pump at most\n\na little bit of jojoba oil on days after wash day \n\nI wash every 3 days or so and use a silk pillowcase and a bonnet but its just so frizzy no matter what I do and it seems like it hates too much product. I usually also diffuse a bit upside down then air dry and my hair on top of my head is way shorter than the sides since its got a lot of catching up to do since it suddenly started growing back in December. Trying to find a style that I can manage to do every morning but also compliments my face well. Thanks in advance for the help!",
