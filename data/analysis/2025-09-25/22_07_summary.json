After the breakout started, I changed my facewash to TheDermaCo Sali-Cinamide anti acne face wash but it did not make any difference. I've also been getting enough sleep.\nI‚Äôm not sure if I should be changing something in my skincare/lifestyle. For now, I‚Äôm just using the facewash and re quil moisturizer and aj screenshot \nAny advice on what might be causing it or how to manage it would be really appreciated.\nThanks!\"\n",
