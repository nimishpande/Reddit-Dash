The skin is clearer than it's been in a long time.\n\n**The Unresolved Problem:** My dermatologist (rightfully) told me not to apply the topicals on the very sensitive skin in the creases of my nose and around my mouth. The problem is, the pustules I've always had in those specific spots are still there, and they're incredibly painful. Now that the rest of my face has cleared up, they feel more prominent and frustrating than ever. It's gotten so bad that it hurts to move my mouth.\n\n  \nFor those who also can't use strong topicals everywhere, how did you and your doctor address the stubborn spots in sensitive areas?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/89b20hygj5rf1.png?width=291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d08f424bc5860e1c566cedf6c29666f93f97112\n\n",
