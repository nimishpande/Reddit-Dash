      "content": "Hi everyone,\nI'm asking this on behalf of my bf, 28 (M).\n\"I’ve been dealing with a sudden acne breakout over the past month. Before this, my skin was mostly clear with only the occasional pimple, but now I’m getting clusters of breakouts, mostly on my forehead, and few on the cheek area.\nI hadn’t really changed anything in my routine, diet, or products when the breakout first started. After the breakout started, I changed my facewash to TheDermaCo Sali-Cinamide anti acne face wash but it did not make any difference. I've also been getting enough sleep.\nI’m not sure if I should be changing something in my skincare/lifestyle. For now, I’m just using the facewash and re quil moisturizer and aj screenshot \nAny advice on what might be causing it or how to manage it would be really appreciated.\nThanks!\"\n",

Kinda removes the sunscreen but honestly nah won't recommend it using if you use skincare.\n\nWhat we don't expect from a cleanser is BREAKOUTTTTSSSS.\nweren't bad as hell but I got 2 acne after 2 consistent use of this particular product. The acne are going away tho and I'm not getting more acnes (still using this product).

It feels so unfair..if my skin is bone dry, then why am i still breaking out??\n\nIve tried layering on thick moisturizers to help the dryness, but then my pores just get even more congested. If i back off and use lighter stuff, my face feels like its about to crack in half. Theres LITERALLY no winning.\n\nDoes anyone else deal with this? How do u even balance treating extreme dryness without clogging everything up?",
