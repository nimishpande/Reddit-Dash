I only shampoo my scalp and let the foam run down, then condition the mid to ends and detangle while it’s wet. Once a week I use a hair mask instead of conditioner and that helped a lot. After the shower I don’t towel dry, I put my curl cream on while it’s still soaking wet and scrunch, then add a bit of gel. I squeeze the water out with a T-shirt, let it dry without touching it, and once it’s fully dry I scrunch with a little serum. Way less frizz and way more definition so far 😌\n\nProducts I use:\n\nJoviality Curl Wonder Shampoo\n\nBless Conditioner\n\nRaw African Maya Hair Mask\n\nThe Hair Addict Frizz-Off Curl Activator\n\nBio Soft Flaxseed Gel\n\nLocken Glossy Hair Serum",

      "title": "[PSA] Absolutely Horrendous Shipping Experience With Yesstyle (Please READ)",
      "content": "I am not typically the type of person who would go out of my way to leave bad reviews, BUT the experience I had with Yesstyle, *especially as a broke college student*, has been absolutely horrendous. So, I am putting this here as a post of caution, especially for other college students, and a vent of my frustration. I would appreciate it if you can read this post to the end and if possible, give some comments/suggestions for how to move forward. **TLDR: My package hasn't arrived after 2 months of waiting; complete radio silence from the shipping courier + tracking number while waiting, 2 delivery failures, NOW Yesstyle expects me to pay an additional $11 for my package to get redelivered...**\n\nFor context, I placed my first order on 11/28/25, hoping that my package would arrive before Christmas, which it didn't. That was disappointment #1. During the whole time, whenever I checked the tracking number, it was radio silence. It never showed me the location of the package except that the \"shipping order\" has been made. I reached out to both Yanwen Express (the shipping courier) and Yesstyle multiple times, hoping to receive some sort of confirmation, but neither of them ever had answers for me except for telling me to wait.\n\nThen, early January, I suddenly received an email stating that the 1st package delivery **failed**. So, I immediately arranged for a redelivery with detailed instructions on how to get access to the student mail center. But alas, t**he second delivery attempt failed as well**. At this point, it was mid-January and I was getting really frustrated and fed up with the lack of transparency and communication: the wait time to hear back from customer service was an average of 3 days and they usually don't even address the problem you state in your request except for giving you a generic response, which you can already find on their website.\n\nFor example, when I inquired about the whereabouts of my package, they responded: \"**Please note that this is an international shipment and may experience delivery delays due to customs or postal processing.\"** Like, how is that helpful in any sense? They don't answer any questions directly, and the contact process with them has been incredibly frustrating.\n\nNOW, the most important part is the two outrageous options Yesstyle came up with to resolve my order after wasting so much of my time, energy, and money:\n\n**\"If you elect for reshipment, US$ 11 reshipping fee will be incurred. (Reshipping fee of US$ 6 plus handling fee of US$ 5)**\n\n**(The quoted reshipping fee does not include applicable taxes. If taxes are levied, they will be added to the reshipping fee when collecting payment.)**\n\n**OR**\n\n**Refund**\n\n**It will be issued in store credit, where originally waived shipping fee of USD 6 will be deducted from the refund as we have fulfilled our responsibility to ship out the order in the first place.\"**\n\nIn short, **Yesstyle is telling me that I have to pay money, out of my own pocket just so my package can arrive OR deduct money from my refund to make up for their failures in delivery my package.** Which, isn't that a basic customer right and company guarantee to begin with? How should I go about this? This whole exchange with Yesstyle has been so mentally draining. I spent my entire winter break stressing over this order, and I can't believe this is the best resolution Yesstyle has come up with. Please send advice, words of comfort, or suggestions in the comments below. Thank you for reading this.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hello beauties!\n\nI have a date on Friday and it's getting to the 'you should wear your best undies' point with this guy. The thing is that I've been single for a long time... Like a LONG time, and I'm kinda uncomfortable with my hairy nether regions situation. I'm pretty thickly hairy (and insecure about it), and right now I'm trimmed down pretty short (like 3mm) and it's very spikey, which is unfun. So what do I do? I feel like the options are:\n\n* Shave (but I'm very prone to ingrowns and red bumps)\n* Wax or sugar at home (never tried it, so it seems a little... risky. Also, again I'm prone to ingrowns and red bumps so how long in advance do I do it?)\n* Make an appointment to wax or sugar (same issues, but also probably safer *and* more embarrassing)\n* Try to soften the hair (it might bother me less if the hair was softer, but conditioner and coconut oil can only do so much presumably)\n* Laser (I actually HAVE an IPL device, and I'm super white with dark hair which is ideal, but 1. I'm not sure if I should/can use it on all intimate hair, and 2. My leg hair has grown back super patchy, which I'm worried will happen to my pubic hair and make me even more insecure)\n* I also have bought Veet and have had no reaction to a patch test on my leg, so maybe that's a good option??\n\nSo I'm a bit at a loss. Did I just trim too short and that's what's spikey and uncomfortable? What do I do in the next 5 days? What's really sustainable? What do all you thickly hairy ladies do?",

I went to a dermatologist when i was 16 she recommended isotretinoin gel which i used for 3 months and it cleared them but they came back right away and haven’t left since.. they are basically all over my face.. some place worse than the others. I feel like i have tried everything this past year and nothing works. I tried isotretinoin 0.05, tretinoin 0.05 and adapelene 0.1 (all at different times) for some reason i never purge either. i have tried glycolic acid which did nothing i have tried medicube zero pore pads which do nothing.. i have changed all products in my routine and none of them are pore clogging either. i have tried azelaic acid which doesnt help either. i have tried only barrier supporting routines and they didnt change anything at all either. i have switched between gel to cream moisturisers atp i dont even know what to do. i have only tried salicylic in face wash form and the formulation was bad it burnt my skin lol. even extractions dont do anything because they come back in the exact same spot. I am so so so tired of these i dont even know what causes them which is so frustratin. I really need all the help i can get pleaseeee. I live in the middle east if that helps?",

I'm a beginner when it comes to skin care, so I typically use whatever my friends/dermatologist suggest (whether that be products or extractions for milia). When it initially started, I only washed my face and moisturized. Now, I use this routine:\n\n1. AM+PM Youth To The People Superfood Cleanser\n2. AM+PM Pond’s Dry Skin Cream Facial Moisturizer\n3. AM Anua Azelaic Acid 10 Hyaluron Redness Soothing Serum\n4. AM Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence (SPF)\n\nIn the past (as prescribed by my dermatologist), I've used products like azelaic acid and tretinoin. Though I don't think they did much to combat my issues.\n\nHow should I craft a routine to combat my issues? How do I keep these issues at bay long term? Any suggestions (product/routine) would be extremely helpful! Thanks!!",
