I only shampoo my scalp and let the foam run down, then condition the mid to ends and detangle while it’s wet. Once a week I use a hair mask instead of conditioner and that helped a lot. After the shower I don’t towel dry, I put my curl cream on while it’s still soaking wet and scrunch, then add a bit of gel. I squeeze the water out with a T-shirt, let it dry without touching it, and once it’s fully dry I scrunch with a little serum. Way less frizz and way more definition so far 😌\n\nProducts I use:\n\nJoviality Curl Wonder Shampoo\n\nBless Conditioner\n\nRaw African Maya Hair Mask\n\nThe Hair Addict Frizz-Off Curl Activator\n\nBio Soft Flaxseed Gel\n\nLocken Glossy Hair Serum",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Even slightly patting my face with a towel dries all of the water, so I try to pat as lightly as I possibly can. Then I apply 2 drops of HA, 2 drops of Niacinamide, wait until it dries (about 15-20 seconds), and then I apply a big pea sized moisturiser. After about 3-5 minutes, my face feels a little bit dry again. Sometimes a tiiiiny bit firm, but nothing dramatic.\n\nAm I using the wrong products? Am I using them wrong? Am I possibly using too much, or too little?\n\nHabits and skin type:\n\nNot sure how to describe my face’s skin type. It’s dry, but also oily. My nose and forehead are the most oily. My cheeks tend to get dry thin flakes every now and then. I drink over 1,5L of water a day. Usually more. I do however not wash and moisturise my face daily. I struggle a lot mentally and tend to neglect self care sometimes, but I’m working on getting better. Could not washing and moisturising my face daily possibly be a part of the problem?\n\nAny and all advice and help are more than welcome! Thank you for reading, and thank you in advance!🫶",

I would like some recommendations for shampoos, conditioners, gels, creams, mousse, etc, that has worked well for those who have similar hair to mine.\n\nFor my hair routine, I have been using the OGX Moroccan shampoo, conditioner, and cream for forever, and I've heard some pretty bad stuff about their products... I wash my hair twice a week, once with shampoo and both times with conditioner. I almost always air dry my hair and I wear a bonnet to bed.\n\nFor other info if it matters, most of my family has oily hair, and I assume I would too but because I have curls it doesn't show?? I'm the only one in my family w curly hair, everyone else has either straight or wavy.\n\nThanks!!",

      "content": "I'm 28 and trying to build a consistent skincare routine to maximize benefits before my wedding coming up in in 5 months. My main goals are to improve my texture, hyperpigmentation, and minimize the appearance of fine lines on my forehead.\n\nMy skin is generally dry, but I have a decently strong barrier and have been using tretinoin 0.1% (prescription) nightly in the PM and Paula's Choice pro-collagen peptide plumping moisturizer daily in the AM for the last 2 months. I also just started azelaic acid 15% (prescription) in the AM. (Am I completely ruining the peptides by layering with the azelaic acid's acidity?)\n\nI am already seeing small improvements from this routine and would love to incorporate vitamin C as well but have heard that acids really shouldn't be paired with retinol nor peptides. I would love some wisdom as I have no idea how to do this correctly! Here is much current routine:\n\n* AM: rinse with water, azelaic acid 15% gel, Paula's Choice pro-collagen peptide plumping moisturizer, neutrogena SPF\n* PM: wash with prequel gleanser, let skin dry, apply 0.1% tretinoin, cetaphil moisturizing cream\n\nTLDR: I'd like to use both **peptides** and **vitamin C** in addition to prescription **tretinoin** and **azelaic acid**. How can I layer these all in one daily routine? Can I add vitamin C in the morning or would that negate the benefit of the peptides? Or am I already throwing my money away by ruining the peptides using the azelaic acid at the same time?\n\nThanks in advance for any help at all!",

I started to see dandruff and an itchy scalp pretty soon after but it ended up dying down so I stopped thinking about it.\n\n Around summer time I started noticing an increase in hair loss and dandruff, I was pretty sure it was all because of my use of minoxidil but I didn’t want to go through with the post minoxidil shedding so I kept with it. I started using shampoos, less minoxidil, and even the foam version but it just wasn’t working. My scalp was itchy and eventually towards the end of the year I started seeing noticeable scalp density decreases all over my scalp. \n\nI made the decision to get off minoxidil on December 19th because it was killing my scalp, very soon after I noticed less hair loss and a nice, itchy free scalp, although flakes were still there. After a week however my hair loss began to increase likely from the post minoxidil shedding. It went from bad to worse to horrible, with the peak being on the 13th and it ended up getting better from there. I switched to Sulsun Blue 2n1 and that ending up getting rid of my big flakes but I still have tiny ones that fall out when I move my hair a bit. Recently, in the past few days hair loss has been ramping up, no where near as bad as it was but still it’s been getting worse.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I had worsening density when I was using minoxidil and I still had worsening density a month after quitting, and it seems like that short period of things getting better was nothing at all. I’m scared of losing my hair, I’m only 19, and things like this aren’t seen in my family. The dermatologists I’ve seen all just tell me to wash with a different shampoo, and it helps but nothing is stopping that density from worsening and it seems like new hairs aren’t coming in anyway. Do I just need to wait it out? Is it too late to be free from minoxidil shedding? Is the flakey layer on my scalp to blame? ",

      "content": "Hello beauties!\n\nI have a date on Friday and it's getting to the 'you should wear your best undies' point with this guy. The thing is that I've been single for a long time... Like a LONG time, and I'm kinda uncomfortable with my hairy nether regions situation. I'm pretty thickly hairy (and insecure about it), and right now I'm trimmed down pretty short (like 3mm) and it's very spikey, which is unfun. So what do I do? I feel like the options are:\n\n* Shave (but I'm very prone to ingrowns and red bumps)\n* Wax or sugar at home (never tried it, so it seems a little... risky. Also, again I'm prone to ingrowns and red bumps so how long in advance do I do it?)\n* Make an appointment to wax or sugar (same issues, but also probably safer *and* more embarrassing)\n* Try to soften the hair (it might bother me less if the hair was softer, but conditioner and coconut oil can only do so much presumably)\n* Laser (I actually HAVE an IPL device, and I'm super white with dark hair which is ideal, but 1. I'm not sure if I should/can use it on all intimate hair, and 2. My leg hair has grown back super patchy, which I'm worried will happen to my pubic hair and make me even more insecure)\n* I also have bought Veet and have had no reaction to a patch test on my leg, so maybe that's a good option??\n\nSo I'm a bit at a loss. Did I just trim too short and that's what's spikey and uncomfortable? What do I do in the next 5 days? What's really sustainable? What do all you thickly hairy ladies do?",
