      "content": "Hi! I'm looking for advice on what I should do with my hair. Theres a lot of points I dont like about it, like it never feels touchably soft and flexible even on day 1, the pattern is not consistent, my crown is always super flat with no volume, and I struggle to style my hair bc it dries too fast while styling but takes hours to dry with product. My hair parts strangely. I have to rewet my hair every day if I want semi decent looking hair because the style is always ruined by sleeping, even with a silk pillowcase.The shape is also weird bc I've cut parts of it myself at many points trying to add layers on top of layers from an initial haircut, but I still have a triangle shape no matter what.\n\n**Background on my hair journey:** It's been maybe 1.5 years since I started trying to emphasize the curls in my hair, and 11 months since I chopped my hair to around chin length from having it long. My hair has been dyed permanently black once. Dealing with my hair has always been difficult for me and even though I have a lot of wash products/brushes/stylers at my disposal, I don't have a routine I love enough to be loyal to or technique for styling that I feel works on my hair consistently well. I generally cleanse my hair every other day and I use clarifying shampoo like at least twice a week because I don't feel clean without it.\n\nThe pictures are taken today and yesterday. \n\n**My routine for the first 4 photos (today)**:\n\n\\- It's refreshed with a little bit of AG Care Cloud Air Light Volumizing Mousse scrunched in(didn't use a spray bottle to add water).\n\n\\- The night before, I had washed it with K\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* shampoo and then the Matrix Food for Soft Shampoo as a second cleanse. I don't have d\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* but I use the K\\* shampoo because I have family history of a\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. Matrix Food for Soft Conditioner for 5 mins on one side and Ouidad Defrizzing Conditioner on the right side. Then after the shower, I used a tangle teezer brush to brush style it with Matrix A Curl Can Dream Cream and went to sleep with it like 70% dry on a satin pillowcase.\n\n**Routine for the last 2 pictures:** it was day 2 of having used the AG Care Gel Mousse to style my hair. I had refreshed it that morning with the Camille Rose Moisture Mist since it felt so stiff and weighed down with just the mousse.\n\nIf you had my hair, what would you do with it? Whether it be washing routine, styling routine, haircut, hairstyle wise? Any responses appreciated, I'm super curious and open to anything!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "title": "“Irish Curls” Please Help",
      "content": "reposted because I forgot to cover my face in a photo.\n\n\n\nHi, I am new here, and looking for help with styling and caring for my hair. Sorry this is long. I’ve struggled with my hair my whole life. It’s always had wave in front and wavier in back, like ropes, so I mostly kept it long and wore it down to cover “Irish curls”. I started getting salon cuts as a kid and have had decades of layering and thinning it, and spent my teens and early 20s straightening it. A couple of years ago I decided to grow out the layers and thinning and trim the ends at home, and ended up with a giant curly bump under the back. Recently the bump became bigger and completely unmanageable, so I did some layering, and I have been stunned with how wavy/curly it is. \n\n\n\nMy biggest issue is that it’s still only slightly wavy in front even with diffusing. I do have a bad habit of touching the front of my hair so I’m trying to quit. Clarifying has also seemed to help a little. Did I cut front pieces too short? The front is finer but very thick, and the back is very coarse, tangles easily and very thick. I actually kind of like how it looks with just a scrunch, minimal product and air drying and think the front blends better, but I’m curious whether I can get it to look more like the back so I have the option of wearing it wavier.\n\n\n\nI’m not really sure I have a specific question, but has anyone else found a solution to Irish curls? I’m considering giving up and just growing it long again and using heatless curlers at night, but I’m only a few weeks in to CGM, so trying to not let myself quit. \n\n\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nWash Aveda sapmoss shampoo, nutriplenish conditioner. Lolavie or innersense protein mask every once in awhile when it feels dry. Styling: brush in shower while soaking wet then scrunch, Aveda be curly cream and or gel, brush in sections ecotools curl defining brush, scrunch with t shirt and diffuse \n\n\n\n\n\n* I haven’t colored it since 2017, and sun bum spray on lightener in 2022 once. very rarely use heat, haven’t straightened in about 15 years, stay out of the sun, and only wear it up in a clip. I love hot showers so am trying to use less hot water in the shower. Idk if the front is damaged, but it’s always been straighter than the back.\n* I have to use a clarifying shampoo often and wash daily to every other day because of a scalp condition. I try to make up for it with hydrating conditioner, masks, and leave in conditioner on ends.\n* We have very soft water.\n\n\n\nPics:\n\n1 My hair pre thinning as a kid. The front has some wave so I’m hopeful that will come back\n\n2 the bump pre layers\n\n3 layered no styling\n\n4 diffused\n\nThank you for any advice/ tips! ",

We also know that arrector pili muscles die when you are extensively bald and have major fibrosis. And then we have the issue of escaping stem cells.\n\nSo how did Pelage grow hair from bald areas when we know that progenitor cells and arrector pili muscles die. Also there's the issue of escaping stem cells.\n\n\nThe co-founder of Pelage at 24:25 is saying that the hair follicles are still there and they tested skin sample of a person who was bald for decades and had lots of growth.

      "content": "Hi everyone, l've lurked here for awhile now. As a teenager I had really bad acne, and now in my early 20s thankfully the breakouts have decreased. But I'm left with extremely congested skin. About 75% of the pores you see on my chin when poked and prodded produce a rather quite visible sebum plug.\nThe ones on my t-zone don't. This is also a good skin day for me, and of course I have to include the obligatory \"pic doesn't do it justice\" My pores are just so insanely dark, and large. As you might expect I have tried a lot of different things over the years, but nothing has really seemed to click. I question now, is this the point where I try no skincare at all? Just drinking water? Though to be fair, I have done that for a few days at a time and my skin just looks terribly dull and rough. I had an esthetician once cleanse my face, we got distracted for about 5-10 minutes, and when she returned she looked extremely confused, and said \"is that the oil leaking out of your pores?!\" And handed me a mirror. And of course it was, if I don't put on any products right away you can visibly see oil flowing out of each one. I'm not so sure if there's anything I can do at this point or if I just need one of those crazy laser facials. I'll list below products I have tried: \n\n•numbuzin cleansing oil (I did like this one!).\n•centella cleansing oil. • Anua heartleaf pore cleansing foam. •Cerave cleansing foam. • centella ampoule foam. • centella tone brightening cleansing gel foam. •cosrx aha/bha clarifying treatment times.\n• mixsoon bean essence. •TO niacinamide. • TO glycolic acid 7%. • wishtrend pore smoothing bakichiol serum. •Beauty of Joseun glow serum. •ilike (all natural brand out of Hungary I think) -probiotic serum -probiotic moisturizer -yarrow oil -apple and lemon toner. •centella pore mizing quick clay stick mask. •centella poremizing fresh ampoule. •centella tone brightening capsule ampoule. •centella ampoule (I like this one too!). •sungboon editor green tomato pore lifting ampoule +. •dokdo toner.\n• dokdo moisturizer. •dokdo sunscreen. •dr. Jart porecting solution. •mediheal collagen mask. •tatcha water cream (this seemed to work more on me as a teenager). • beauty of Joseun red bean pore mask (this does do a lot for skin dullness!). •cosrx advanced snail 92 cream. • medicube zero pore pad 2.0 (1 do think this does a lot of brightening and helps my pores a bit but it seems to also irritate my skin).\n\nSo yeah. I don't currently have a solid routine, l used to, and it was a mix and match of all those products for about 2-3 weeks at a time. If anyone has any recommendations, it would be much appreciated. Just thinking out loud it feels as though nothing really cleans out my pores well enough. And if it did it would probably just damage my skin barrier. \nI've had African black soap recommended to me, and l've heard of Norse organics (really simple routine). Just don't know which direction I should go in anymore. If you made it all the way down to the bottom here, thank you❤️\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "I've got seborrheic dermatitis (scalp and face), severely oily skin (and hair), as well as adult acne. My skin is so oily that it gets visibly shiny the day after showering. My (very short) hair is the same way and constantly looks wet. It's exhausting and nothing I do seems to help. I've been trying to find products to target these issues that are easily accessible to me, as well as a routine that's accessible for me as a physically disabled person with chronic fatigue (and ADHD lol). I can't really buy one-off products much (i.e. *disposable* single use eye masks, lip masks, face masks, etc.) since I wouldn't be able to afford them every time I need to wash my face, but I'm fine with containers/bottles of product that will last me a while.\n\nEverything I've previously found is difficult for me to do because it's a dozen steps or requires 10 different products, or has to be done twice a day. I'm a beginner in regards to skin care, and nobody ever taught me to really take care of myself or what my body would need. I have no idea where to even start to even begin to help myself (I've checked the wiki, and it's just overwhelming for me to try and help myself with no experience), so I thought I may as well submit a post. Hair care is probably my next stop. \n\nNote that I did go to a dermatologist for years but they refused to help me in a way that matters for my skin issues (and kept telling me nothing was wrong despite being *literally diagnosed* with sebderm), so I've decided to turn to Reddit to ask for help. I'll add stuff I have used in a comment.",

      "content": "Hey there!\n\n**Context:** I’ve been trying to figure out my skincare routine for months, switching between CeraVe and Neutrogena. At first, I made the early mistake of using four CeraVe cleansers at once: Oil, Foaming, Salicylic Acid, and Benzoyl Peroxide, and completely wrecked my skin. After this, I simplified my routine and experimented with Neutrogena’s Hydro Boost line. Now, after lots of trial and error (and some burning and redness), I finally found two Neutrogena products that actually work for me. Also to note: I do have oily skin.\n\n**Question:** I want to mix the two brands for my routine, but I've heard from family that it would damage my skin rather than heal it and help with my acne journey. Have you guys mixed brands and seen that it's helpful? Specifically, I want to mix my gel cleanser and day moisturizer/sunscreen from Neutrogena with my foaming cleanser that targets oily skin from CeraVe.\n\n**TL;DR:** Can I mix two brands without detrimental effects to my skin?\n\nAny comments and questions are appreciated!",
