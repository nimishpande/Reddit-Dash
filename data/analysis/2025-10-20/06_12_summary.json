      "content": "Hi! I'm looking for advice on what I should do with my hair. Theres a lot of points I dont like about it, like it never feels touchably soft and flexible even on day 1, the pattern is not consistent, my crown is always super flat with no volume, and I struggle to style my hair bc it dries too fast while styling but takes hours to dry with product. My hair parts strangely. I have to rewet my hair every day if I want semi decent looking hair because the style is always ruined by sleeping, even with a silk pillowcase.The shape is also weird bc I've cut parts of it myself at many points trying to add layers on top of layers from an initial haircut, but I still have a triangle shape no matter what.\n\n**Background on my hair journey:** It's been maybe 1.5 years since I started trying to emphasize the curls in my hair, and 11 months since I chopped my hair to around chin length from having it long. My hair has been dyed permanently black once. Dealing with my hair has always been difficult for me and even though I have a lot of wash products/brushes/stylers at my disposal, I don't have a routine I love enough to be loyal to or technique for styling that I feel works on my hair consistently well. I generally cleanse my hair every other day and I use clarifying shampoo like at least twice a week because I don't feel clean without it.\n\nThe pictures are taken today and yesterday. \n\n**My routine for the first 4 photos (today)**:\n\n\\- It's refreshed with a little bit of AG Care Cloud Air Light Volumizing Mousse scrunched in(didn't use a spray bottle to add water).\n\n\\- The night before, I had washed it with K\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* shampoo and then the Matrix Food for Soft Shampoo as a second cleanse. I don't have d\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* but I use the K\\* shampoo because I have family history of a\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. Matrix Food for Soft Conditioner for 5 mins on one side and Ouidad Defrizzing Conditioner on the right side. Then after the shower, I used a tangle teezer brush to brush style it with Matrix A Curl Can Dream Cream and went to sleep with it like 70% dry on a satin pillowcase.\n\n**Routine for the last 2 pictures:** it was day 2 of having used the AG Care Gel Mousse to style my hair. I had refreshed it that morning with the Camille Rose Moisture Mist since it felt so stiff and weighed down with just the mousse.\n\nIf you had my hair, what would you do with it? Whether it be washing routine, styling routine, haircut, hairstyle wise? Any responses appreciated, I'm super curious and open to anything!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "I dont know if its the OCD/Body Dysmorphia in me, also im not sure if its wrong to feel this way, do people generally feel this way when going through hair loss? but man nothing compensates enough for hair loss, stuff like \"shave and get buff and go to gym\" never really helps, its such a dumb saying, or atleast it never helped me get over the hair loss, its an attempt in compensating but its not enough, even if you go through with it you'll realise that all the muscles and being big is not enough to compensate ur actual insecurity and thats where the mentality of giving up comes in, atleast for me.\n\nIve been bald for 10 years since age 20 and im about to turn 30 next month and there has not been, through those years ive gone through like 10 different phases, working out for years and getting \"buff\" buying new fresh clothes and dressing well, buying all the latest fragrances but nothing is ever fucking enough for me to actually come out of my shell and do something besides go to work and home.\n\nI just feel like im a spectator and im waiting for this life to end or some miracle to happen so i can start living again(with hair), i went bald way too young and that was way too harsh, i never really got to live, i spent my 20s inside my house embarrased about being bald.\n\nAnyways i guess thats what the O in OCD stands for, obsession and im obsessing over hair for over 12 years now and ive been norwood 7 for 10 of them.\n\nFunnily enough i dont obsess over anything else besides hair, i got many more flaws but nothing i care about, also i didnt really have OCD or anxiety before i started balding, not sure if thats age related or hair loss triggering that for me, If i would get hair tomorrow (just even a nw3 at this point) i would do everything, i would literally be so fucking happy and outgoing, all the things i would do and get done, it would be unbeliveable, im just sad i got dealt with this shitty hand and im jealous of people who can go bald in their 20s and just get over it and live their life and not drop out of school and not get a job for years because of that.\n\nEven if u look someone like bradley martyn who has a physique that is literally 0.1% and not obtainable naturally STILL hiding behind his hat at almost 40 years old despite having insane physique.\n\nAnyways just a small rant about the \"shave and get fit\" only people with hair say that shit, even finding a motivation to get fit as someone who is bald is hard, just feel like giving up cause no matter how hard you try to compensate it wont be enough, if u care about hair in the first place you cant just get rid of the insecurity by having muscles.\n\nAnyways, take ur dut fellas, if u hate balding in ur 20s u still will at 30s and 40s.\n\ni lowkey i wish i just had a chance, give me a fucking norwood 3 at 25 or norwood 3 at 30 years old, not norwood 7 at 20 when i have nothing left to try or do, no transplant or no drugs help if ur that fucked.\n\nIll try this again at 40, maybe ill finally be fine with being bald at that age, if i could pay 50% of my salary every month for the rest of my life just to have hair i would do that in a heartbeat.",

I went to a derm many months ago and they prescribed me with a tretinoin % microsphere gel &amp; a clindamycin+benzoyl low percent lotion. they told me to alternate between them every night so I’ve been rinsing my face in the AM and using the foaming facial cleanser from cerave, then occasionally the eqqualberry swimming pool toner, then the prescribed gels, and then the purito oat in calming gel lotion in the PM.\n\nit has gotten a lot better than back then but I found it’s recently been surfacing again :,) and it makes me want to cut out all my skin care entirely so that’s what I’ve been doing the past days. I don’t know what to do and I’m hesitant in trying anything new :(\n\nhas anyone’s closed comedones left on its own with time? please help! or any tips?",

My (very short) hair is the same way and constantly looks wet. It's exhausting and nothing I do seems to help. I've been trying to find products to target these issues that are easily accessible to me, as well as a routine that's accessible for me as a physically disabled person with chronic fatigue (and ADHD lol). I can't really buy one-off products much (i.e. *disposable* single use eye masks, lip masks, face masks, etc.) since I wouldn't be able to afford them every time I need to wash my face, but I'm fine with containers/bottles of product that will last me a while.\n\nEverything I've previously found is difficult for me to do because it's a dozen steps or requires 10 different products, or has to be done twice a day. I'm a beginner in regards to skin care, and nobody ever taught me to really take care of myself or what my body would need. I have no idea where to even start to even begin to help myself (I've checked the wiki, and it's just overwhelming for me to try and help myself with no experience), so I thought I may as well submit a post. Hair care is probably my next stop. \n\nNote that I did go to a dermatologist for years but they refused to help me in a way that matters for my skin issues (and kept telling me nothing was wrong despite being *literally diagnosed* with sebderm), so I've decided to turn to Reddit to ask for help. I'll add stuff I have used in a comment.",
