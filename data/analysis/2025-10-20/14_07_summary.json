      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe‚Ñ¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "title": "The #1 hair transplant clinic red flag (and how to avoid it)",
      "content": "When you are looking for a hair transplant, you're likely deep in the trenches by looking on Reddit, forums etc. And it's very easy to make a big mistake. That one mistake can result in many problems.\n\nFor example:\n\n* a botched result that leaves you with regret\n* spending double the price of your original hair transplant to repair it\n* Too much damage to your donor area for future transplants\n\nThe biggest problem is that in order to choose a clinic/surgeon, you basically have to become an expert at it. And when you are brand new to a topic, it's easy to think you are an expert while you actually have no idea how high the mountain really is. It's not your fault, that's just the Dunning Kruger effect.\n\nAnd that's ok, I'll help you choose the right clinic because I've done it a couple times now.\n\nContext:¬†*I've dealt with hair loss for 9 years now. From 19 to 25 it got worse and worse. Started doing combovers, wearing hats and shaving it off. I hated it. Eventually learned what I needed to stabilize my hair loss (finasteride). After being stable, I looked at local clinics and nearly chose the wrong clinic. My entire hair loss journey has cost me over $15k, so I hope this helps you avoid spending anywhere close to that much. I've also helped 300+ men navigate their hair loss journey in the last 3 years.*\n\nSo, from my time doing research into hair transplant clinics and doing over 10+ consultations, I've collected a list of red flags. Right now it's a pretty big list with over 60 red flags total, but today I wanted to talk about just one.\n\n**\"More grafts = better\"**\n\nWhen comparing clinics and asking for quotes, you'll see that the graft count can vary a lot. Even in cases that mirror your exact situation, one person will get 1500 grafts while the other may get 4000. And it's easy to think that 4000 = better.\n\nBut you don't have unlimited grafts. You actually have less than 10k available in your donor zone. And you can only use them once. So use them wisely.\n\nBut clinics know that humans think that 'bigger number = better'. So they may try to play into that. If they advertise huge hair transplant sessions (I consider anything above 3500 huge), you need to be very careful that they aren't doing it for their marketing, or to boost their bottom line.\n\nExample: Perhaps your case only needs 2000 grafts. If you multiply it by a graft price of $2 per graft, you'd spend $4000. But if another clinic advertises a graft price of $1,50, they could quote you 4000 grafts, which ends up costing you $6000.\n\nNow the 2nd clinic used extra grafts you maybe didn't even need, and you spent extra cash you could've needed for other work. Your donor area has also been depleted more, which means you have less options into the future. The donor area had also likely experienced more agressive extraction, that alone leaves you with damage. More damage = less options\n\nOr maybe you had enough donor for 3 hair transplants, but because of the bad work of the first one you can only leave it at that.\n\nSo don't blindly follow 'big number = better'. It will likely bite back.\n\nLet me know if you want the full list or have any other questions :)",

Ive been applying castor oil to my brows to help them but no real result. \n\nAny advice for what i should do to get brows that frame my face properly? \n\n(Ignore the henna freckle dots on the photo, and red dots from freshly trying to reshape my brows) ",

(Due to the thick brow trend and using dip brow pomades) and now that natural brows are in my eyebrows are just lacking.  When i try to fill them in a nice subtle way the makeup always rubs off in seconds no matter what product i try (i think my skin texture on my brows is just unforgiving) and it never looks really great. Also in life i am just wearing makeup alot less and lost the touch of makeup and feel like i cant do it right anymore. \n\nIdeally id like to grow more hair so i can pluck off how my eyebrows are so downturned and make me look sad- but i dont want to do that right now because then id have no tail to my eyebrows. \n\nIm hesitant to do microblading because im worried it will look bad when im older. Ive been applying castor oil to my brows to help them but no real result. \n\nAny advice for what i should do to get brows that frame my face properly? \n\n(Ignore the henna freckle dots on the photo, and red dots from freshly trying to reshape my brows) ",
