      "content": "Hi! I'm looking for advice on what I should do with my hair. Theres a lot of points I dont like about it, like it never feels touchably soft and flexible even on day 1, the pattern is not consistent, my crown is always super flat with no volume, and I struggle to style my hair bc it dries too fast while styling but takes hours to dry with product. My hair parts strangely. I have to rewet my hair every day if I want semi decent looking hair because the style is always ruined by sleeping, even with a silk pillowcase.The shape is also weird bc I've cut parts of it myself at many points trying to add layers on top of layers from an initial haircut, but I still have a triangle shape no matter what.\n\n**Background on my hair journey:** It's been maybe 1.5 years since I started trying to emphasize the curls in my hair, and 11 months since I chopped my hair to around chin length from having it long. My hair has been dyed permanently black once. Dealing with my hair has always been difficult for me and even though I have a lot of wash products/brushes/stylers at my disposal, I don't have a routine I love enough to be loyal to or technique for styling that I feel works on my hair consistently well. I generally cleanse my hair every other day and I use clarifying shampoo like at least twice a week because I don't feel clean without it.\n\nThe pictures are taken today and yesterday. \n\n**My routine for the first 4 photos (today)**:\n\n\\- It's refreshed with a little bit of AG Care Cloud Air Light Volumizing Mousse scrunched in(didn't use a spray bottle to add water).\n\n\\- The night before, I had washed it with K\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* shampoo and then the Matrix Food for Soft Shampoo as a second cleanse. I don't have d\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* but I use the K\\* shampoo because I have family history of a\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. Matrix Food for Soft Conditioner for 5 mins on one side and Ouidad Defrizzing Conditioner on the right side. Then after the shower, I used a tangle teezer brush to brush style it with Matrix A Curl Can Dream Cream and went to sleep with it like 70% dry on a satin pillowcase.\n\n**Routine for the last 2 pictures:** it was day 2 of having used the AG Care Gel Mousse to style my hair. I had refreshed it that morning with the Camille Rose Moisture Mist since it felt so stiff and weighed down with just the mousse.\n\nIf you had my hair, what would you do with it? Whether it be washing routine, styling routine, haircut, hairstyle wise? Any responses appreciated, I'm super curious and open to anything!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

(Any advice would be extremely appreciated!)\n\nMy family is on my mom and dad side are notorious for having really big recession in the temples and I started noticing it on myself too so I decided to hop on 1mg of finasteride. \n\nIve been taking it for about 6 and a half months now, I have not noticed any side effects (even in bed I can go for multiple rounds). I decided to start derma rolling and using minoxidil at night for the last 2 weeks because I haven’t seen from what I can tell any regrowth from finasteride atall.\n\nIve also started to try taking some supplements. I take protein powder, vitamin d3, k2 and Zinc, magnesium(all in one pill). Omega 3 fatty acids (consumed via a can of sardines). Lastly I just started some ashwaganda (300mg) a couple days ago so we’ll see if it will help manage stress.",

      "title": "“Irish Curls” Please Help",
      "content": "reposted because I forgot to cover my face in a photo.\n\n\n\nHi, I am new here, and looking for help with styling and caring for my hair. Sorry this is long. I’ve struggled with my hair my whole life. It’s always had wave in front and wavier in back, like ropes, so I mostly kept it long and wore it down to cover “Irish curls”. I started getting salon cuts as a kid and have had decades of layering and thinning it, and spent my teens and early 20s straightening it. A couple of years ago I decided to grow out the layers and thinning and trim the ends at home, and ended up with a giant curly bump under the back. Recently the bump became bigger and completely unmanageable, so I did some layering, and I have been stunned with how wavy/curly it is. \n\n\n\nMy biggest issue is that it’s still only slightly wavy in front even with diffusing. I do have a bad habit of touching the front of my hair so I’m trying to quit. Clarifying has also seemed to help a little. Did I cut front pieces too short? The front is finer but very thick, and the back is very coarse, tangles easily and very thick. I actually kind of like how it looks with just a scrunch, minimal product and air drying and think the front blends better, but I’m curious whether I can get it to look more like the back so I have the option of wearing it wavier.\n\n\n\nI’m not really sure I have a specific question, but has anyone else found a solution to Irish curls? I’m considering giving up and just growing it long again and using heatless curlers at night, but I’m only a few weeks in to CGM, so trying to not let myself quit. \n\n\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nWash Aveda sapmoss shampoo, nutriplenish conditioner. Lolavie or innersense protein mask every once in awhile when it feels dry. Styling: brush in shower while soaking wet then scrunch, Aveda be curly cream and or gel, brush in sections ecotools curl defining brush, scrunch with t shirt and diffuse \n\n\n\n\n\n* I haven’t colored it since 2017, and sun bum spray on lightener in 2022 once. very rarely use heat, haven’t straightened in about 15 years, stay out of the sun, and only wear it up in a clip. I love hot showers so am trying to use less hot water in the shower. Idk if the front is damaged, but it’s always been straighter than the back.\n* I have to use a clarifying shampoo often and wash daily to every other day because of a scalp condition. I try to make up for it with hydrating conditioner, masks, and leave in conditioner on ends.\n* We have very soft water.\n\n\n\nPics:\n\n1 My hair pre thinning as a kid. The front has some wave so I’m hopeful that will come back\n\n2 the bump pre layers\n\n3 layered no styling\n\n4 diffused\n\nThank you for any advice/ tips! ",

I have tried using it on my nose because I have a lot of oil and sebaceous filaments and massive pores here and I’ve heard adapelene is a solution to this but it’s done absolutely nothing other then dry and make it flake off and make me look dirty. I’m super scared and hesitant to start any skin care because I’m worried it’s going to clog up my large open pores and make me get terrible acne and breakout. My skin is pretty reactive. So while I have upset, dry in some spots but extremely slick and oily, sun damaged, textured red skin it at least doesn’t have large acne that you can see from a far. But I think it’s time I try to take care of it right so I guess I am just hoping someone can help me find a good routine to target sebaceous filaments and broken capillaries, sun damage and fine lines and then I guess try to hydrate it? Or to let me know what to do based off what you see in the pics if you have a similar experience. Idek.

We also know that arrector pili muscles die when you are extensively bald and have major fibrosis. And then we have the issue of escaping stem cells.\n\nSo how did Pelage grow hair from bald areas when we know that progenitor cells and arrector pili muscles die. Also there's the issue of escaping stem cells.\n\n\nThe co-founder of Pelage at 24:25 is saying that the hair follicles are still there and they tested skin sample of a person who was bald for decades and had lots of growth. So now I don't know which is right which is frustrating.\n\n\n24:25 one of co-founders of Pelage talking about hair follicle stems cells on those who have advanced pattern hair loss.\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/using-metabolism-to-improve-skin-aging-and-hair-loss/id1730821144?i=1000652866815",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

There are red spots all over, and it hurts to even put aloe Vera on. I've been using zinc oxide with black seed oil cream that's meant for baby rashes, and it has somewhat helped.\nHowever, I am worried the burn marks will scar. Should I leave it to heal on its own or contact a dermatologist for help? Has anybody dealt with something like this that could give me advice? Dermatologists here are quite expensive, so l'd like to know if this is a good reason to contact one and that I am not wasting my money.\nThank you.",

Long story short, I applied the “curling cream” before road trip, did not rinse it out for a whole day, and since then my hair and scalp have been completely ruined. Ever since that roadtrip my hair has been shedding pretty badly, my scalp itches, it smells weird, it’s extremely dry and it genuinely looks horrible. I’ve tried cutting it short which didn’t help, besides that I’ve stuck to my routine of shampooing and conditioning twice a week. I Don’t put anything in my hair besides that, but it still feels like I’ve got some kind of strong hair wax in at all times. I’d appreciate some help I genuinely don’t know what to do, thank you in advance😁",
