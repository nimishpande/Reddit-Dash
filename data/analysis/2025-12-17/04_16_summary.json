      "content": "everyone’s advice was right! i had a pretty large milia on my cheek (quite noticeable in photos and irl) and it finally came out today! i used a combination of methods so im not sure which fixed it, but it worked! \n\nfor a week or so i did the hot water on a towel to dry it out trick, it seemed to harden it and bring it to the surface more but wouldn’t come out.  i use glycolic acid toner anyway but i started putting more onto the milia and rubbing it gently when i did my skincare. this also did seem to bring it to a “head” more. \n\nhowever, the strangest thing happened a few days ago. i got a pimple right where the milia was! it became really red and prominent (albeit painless), became a lot harder and brought the milia to the surface a lot more. i noticed one day after washing my face that the pimple seemed to be popping, but it was just normal pimple contents &amp; not the milia. i put \n hydrocolloid patches on it for a few days &amp; after that i continued my skincare routine as normal. the pimple/milia began to shrink and today i simply itched my cheek and felt the whole milia just pop out. \n\ni can’t believe something i dealt with for so long is finally gone! i only have one left on my waterline now, so i will continue to take these steps^ and hopefully find out which works best! \n\njust wanted to share my success story with you guys, i hope the same happens to you if you want to get rid of your milia! i read a lot of potential solutions on this reddit page and didn’t believe any until now, you don’t have to have milia forever!

      "content": "Hi, I am wondering why hair stylists who do dry curly cuts require you to come in with no product? My hair is completely different with and without product. Without product, it is a giant ball of frizz. There are no individual curls. With product, I have clearly defined curls. I have never gone outside of my house with no product on my hair and I'm scared to. I've had curly cuts before but I didn't know you weren't supposed to put in product. Now my stylist is telling me I have to come in without product and I would love to hear why, so that I feel reassured that it will come out well. I looked it up online and it said it's so they can see how each individual curls falls, but without product, I have no curls. Just frizz. I'm worried they will not cut my hair in the way I normally wear it.  Photo of how I usually style my hair. Thanks!\n\nRoutine:\n\nWash with Dove Intensive Shampoo\nCondition with John Frieda Ultra Volume\nIn shower, apply Not Your Mother's Curl Gel\nOutside shower, apply AG re:coil and scrunch\nChi Heat protecting spray \nDiffuse \nSleep with a silk bonnet, never towel dry, rather brush with a Denman\n\nAnd if anyone has further advice to get rid of the frizz, I'm all ears 😁 Thank you!",

Quit immediately. Tried a few other things couldn't stick to it.\n\nSo I ditched the drugs, did a little digging and decided on microneedling and red light therapy only. It worked and some of my grays are gone. I'm convinced this sub is ran by \"big hair pharma\" so it'll likely be pulled by the mods, but here are the results. (See photos) \n\nHair is brushed to the side, you can't tell from the photo but still a bit thin on top, I can notice it out of the shower but I'm going to keep up with it.\n\nMy regiment is microneedling with a 1.5 mm roller once a week and I wear a red light baseball hat on the way to work 5 days per week (about a 35 minute drive).\n\nGot the roller off of amazon and the cap off of temu for a fraction of the cost these assholes want to charge.\n\nClearly it works. Save your ween, avoid the drugs.\n\nBefore is March of 2025 after is a yesterday.",

I bought hair clippers and scissors about a month ago and now I need to trim my hair again. The problem is I don't know how to go about cutting my hair and it's looking kinda weird right now. \n\nI'm still waiting for my bangs to grow out since I like them longer but I need to trim the top since I don't like how puffy my hair looks from the front. My last hairdresser went a little crazy and shaved my sides pretty far back. In the second Image the blue line indicates where I shaved to and the red one is where he shaved to. I'm thinking of waiting for the hair between both lines to grow out but I'm not sure. \n\nThe third image is my hair before I got it cut and I really liked it like that. How would I need to cut my hair to guide it towards that direction? How can I also cut it so it looks less puffy from the front? Also should I cut my curly hair wet or dry?\n\nThank you in advance! &lt;3",

I am 99% sure the red areas are ingrown which are very deep, being there for months. When I say deep, I mean I can't even see it under my skin. Usually you might see it just below a layer or few of skin, but I can't see these. Is there a recommended cream I could buy to bring them out or maybe exfoliate them, or something that destroys them from the inside?? People please help",

      "content": "Long time lurker on here, been through lots of ups and downs with my skin over the years. Used to have awful acne, went on Accutane and it cleared for a few years. Now, I notice that my skin flares up whenever I have sugar, dairy or gluten. I've gotten it mostly controlled, and at least when I break out, I saw it coming. I noticed that I do have very dry, sensitive skin.\n\n\n\nFor the last few weeks, I've been getting tons of these tiny little zits. I have no idea what would cause this. I was originally using cleanser (Vanicream) twice a day, using Purito Oat Gel as moisturizer day and night. Usually, about halfway through the work day, my skin would feel extremely tight and greasy. I thought that these tiny zits might have to do with a moisture barrier issue, so I started only cleansing at night and rinsing my face in the morning. However, the issue persists. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ni891e3vo7g1.jpg?width=2348&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1fba6ef7e72ef32be49155bdaa58a7b38f05323\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8i931e3vo7g1.jpg?width=2233&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5860de93c8c5d90cc36f530f97c616be68090f76\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xuo2c1e3vo7g1.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e0aee68b9477f6e6e5ecb139953dc307adff024\n\nI'm not really sure how to tackle this or what's causing it. Any ideas? Thinking maybe I need to cleanse in the morning too and just moisturize halfway through the day? This is uncharted territory for me lol",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "I started using adapalene–benzoyl peroxide 0.1%/2.5% gel about a week ago. I had read it was supposed to take around 4 weeks to see results, so I was honestly surprised to notice changes so quickly.\n\n\n\nDay 1-4 went smoothly with no reaction. Day 5 was when the irritation hit hardest, my skin was stinging badly, and I woke up the next morning with flaking + redness around the mouth and under the eyes. It even swelled a bit? I decided to take a break on day 6 and did some slugging, which helped restore a lot of moisture.\n\n\n\nNow on day 7, the stinging is mostly gone, but I’m still dealing with some redness and flaking.\n\n",
