      "title": "Curly Cut - Why no product?",
      "content": "Hi, I am wondering why hair stylists who do dry curly cuts require you to come in with no product? My hair is completely different with and without product. Without product, it is a giant ball of frizz. There are no individual curls. With product, I have clearly defined curls. I have never gone outside of my house with no product on my hair and I'm scared to. I've had curly cuts before but I didn't know you weren't supposed to put in product. Now my stylist is telling me I have to come in without product and I would love to hear why, so that I feel reassured that it will come out well. I looked it up online and it said it's so they can see how each individual curls falls, but without product, I have no curls. Just frizz. I'm worried they will not cut my hair in the way I normally wear it.  Photo of how I usually style my hair. Thanks!\n\nRoutine:\n\nWash with Dove Intensive Shampoo\nCondition with John Frieda Ultra Volume\nIn shower, apply Not Your Mother's Curl Gel\nOutside shower, apply AG re:coil and scrunch\nChi Heat protecting spray \nDiffuse \nSleep with a silk bonnet, never towel dry, rather brush with a Denman\n\nAnd if anyone has further advice to get rid of the frizz, I'm all ears 😁 Thank you!",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m about to start using minoxidil to help regrow some hair around my hairline. While researching it, I’ve repeatedly come across the point that—like many medications—minoxidil must be used continuously to maintain any results. If you stop, the regrown hair is usually lost.\n\nWhat I’ve been wondering, and what I’d really appreciate insight on from someone more experienced, is this: with newer and potentially more advanced hair-loss treatments on the horizon (such as PP405 and other emerging therapies showing promising results), is it likely that people would still need to use minoxidil to maintain the hair they’ve gained? Even if these newer “miracle” treatments become publicly available, would minoxidil still be necessary for retention of the hair that was grown using it?\n\nGiven how many new treatments seem to be on the horizon, I’m also questioning whether it’s worth starting minoxidil at all right now, if hairloss is not super aggressive and fast.\n\nAny insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, and happy holidays!\n",
