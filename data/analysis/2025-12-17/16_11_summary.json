      "content": "Hi all! \n\nSo, I'm hoping to ask if anyone has advice on a good shampoo (+ conditioner) for tight curls that are washed daily. (Sorry for the long post!) \n\nMy siblings and I all have curly hair, but different tightness of curls. My older sister is currently in the process of learning how to care for her hair for the first time, and since I have experience with my own curls, I'm making her a gift basket with products and instructions/guides/resources (including this subreddit!). \n\nMy concern is that my sister washes her hair every day and is super not open to co-washing or skipping days. (She gets germ anxiety, so daily showers are really important to her.) Her hair is already pretty dry and since she washes daily, I'm wondering if people have recommendations for good shampoos that are easy on dry hair for daily washing. I know its trial and error! But hoping for advice on a good starting point.\n\nShe has ringlet curls (not super tight/small, but moderately tight, defined, spiral curls through most of her hair) that sits at about her shoulder blades. I can tell its dry and I have plans to give some nice conditioner(s) (daily, leave in, and deep condition), but I'm worried that most curl-friendly shampoos I've used before will be too rough for her daily routine. I know to avoid sulfates and silicones and whatnot, but I'm wondering if anyone could provide specific recs or suggestions for daily washers. \n\n(She's also on estrogen/hrt, which I know can affect things, but I figure that's more trial and error.)\n\n\n[The routine I'm planning to recommend: with lots of trial and error recommended\n\n-- start with a clarifying shampoo for initial wash (reuse clarifying shampoo only when product builds up - I used to do once a month, but I'll recommend adjusting based on what she sees)\n-- some sort of soft shampoo for daily use \n-- deep condition (im looking at the wiki guide for advice) (planning to recommend that she starts by deep conditioning 1-2 times per month)\n-- air drying daily (hopefully diffuser for events/big days, but she doesnt like to spend much time) \n-- curl creme for daily use \n-- curl gel for events/big hair days \n\nI think that roughly covers it?]",

      "content": "So I am 16F and really need advice for my hair. For almost my whole childhood, my parents treated my hair as straight hair (brushing it through etc etc) and i always thought i just had frizzy hair but only like this year have i realized that OH! my hair is wavy/curly.  \nMy brothers hair is like really curly too but it's short so he's useless for advice.\n\nOn a good day (days i shower) the curls are pretty prominent, however my hair is still really frizzy after it dries. But then when i sleep it becomes a tanged mess ofcourse and is untamable. I use the TRESemmé bouncy curls shampoo and Coditioner (i dont really have the option of looking for something better because we dont really have the money to finance it).\n\nmy hair also really dry i believe so i need tips on how to hydrate it?  \nI have a really busy routine so it's really hard to even shower for a long time.\n\nI dont really know what to do to maintain these curls. On days that i havent showered they are a wild jungle of a mess and i get frustrated and brush them through which looks like really ugly.\n\ni think it's a combination of dry hair and my lack of knowledge because despite so many things online i cant really understand.\n\ni believe my hair is 2C to 3A ish. Honestly, theyve got a mind of their own.\n\nHow can I hydrate them so theyre not frizzy? (other than oiling) and what type of routine do i need for improvement? is there something i can make at home? what is a curl cream and do i really need those fancy products?  \nAlso how do i keep my hair from not descending into a tangled mess overnight?\n\nAlso im looking for haircut options for me. my hair comes to like just above my mid back. Would layers be good to lessen the volume?",

      "content": "I am 24 and have started noticing in the past month or two that I’ve developed some deep marionette lines, particularly in the left side of my face. I think this could be because even though I fall asleep on my back, I often turn onto my left air while I’m asleep. Is there anything, short of filler or a face lift, that could me address this issue? It’s made my whole face uneven and made me very self-conscious. I make sure to wear sunscreen everyday and try to be litigious about re-applying it. I also use a prescription retinol. My whole routine is focused on hydration at the moment, and I also try to drink a lot of water. I’ve even started using a gua sha recently, and I’m hoping that will help. Is there anything else I could try that might help?\n",

I didn’t have this many before starting Epiduo.\n\nThey are small, not very inflamed, and appear in areas where I usually break out.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar around week 4?\nDoes this look like purging or irritation?\n\nAny advice would really help.

There’s a lot more straightened/barely wavy pieces a day or two after that frustrate me sooo much! Doing a refresh helps but it becomes really frizzy and poofy towards the ends so I’m probably doing something wrong. I’ve watched like 10 refresh videos on TikTok idk what I’m doing wrong😭 It’s so annoying only having one good hair day until I wash it again. The other days I feel it looks too chaotic and this makes me insecure about it. I know it’s not ugly, but a lot of days it doesn’t feel pretty enough to wear down either if that makes sense.\nThe last picture is all the products I use. I’m trying to get away from not your mothers I feel like it doesn’t do much for me anymore. I’m iffy about native but it smells really good lol. Any style, cut and product suggestions would be appreciated",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

I’m so unsure of which ones to keep so I desperately need help. My hair is dark blonde and has never been dyed. It’s darker on the bottom and lighter on top due to the sun. I feel like this makes it difficult to find a shade match.\n\nOption number one is brownish blonde balayage and option number two is champagne blonde balayage. I choose option number one myself after doing some research on social media and seeing people with similar hair colors to mine using it. But I got recommended option number two by the retailer after sending them photos of my hair. My initial reaction is that none of them is a perfect match but I think i prefer option number one? Both of the colors are described as warm on the website but I feel like they look kinda cold compared to my hair.\n\nI’ve added some photos of my hair for reference and some photos of the extensions from the website and side by side with my hair. Most of the photos are taken in natural daylight. Unfortunately I’m not able to actually try them on so bear with me here.\n\nI would love any feedback and input! \n",
