      "title": "Curly Cut - Why no product?",
      "content": "Hi, I am wondering why hair stylists who do dry curly cuts require you to come in with no product? My hair is completely different with and without product. Without product, it is a giant ball of frizz. There are no individual curls. With product, I have clearly defined curls. I have never gone outside of my house with no product on my hair and I'm scared to. I've had curly cuts before but I didn't know you weren't supposed to put in product. Now my stylist is telling me I have to come in without product and I would love to hear why, so that I feel reassured that it will come out well. I looked it up online and it said it's so they can see how each individual curls falls, but without product, I have no curls. Just frizz. I'm worried they will not cut my hair in the way I normally wear it.  Photo of how I usually style my hair. Thanks!\n\nRoutine:\n\nWash with Dove Intensive Shampoo\nCondition with John Frieda Ultra Volume\nIn shower, apply Not Your Mother's Curl Gel\nOutside shower, apply AG re:coil and scrunch\nChi Heat protecting spray \nDiffuse \nSleep with a silk bonnet, never towel dry, rather brush with a Denman\n\nAnd if anyone has further advice to get rid of the frizz, I'm all ears 😁 Thank you!",

I bought hair clippers and scissors about a month ago and now I need to trim my hair again. The problem is I don't know how to go about cutting my hair and it's looking kinda weird right now. \n\nI'm still waiting for my bangs to grow out since I like them longer but I need to trim the top since I don't like how puffy my hair looks from the front. My last hairdresser went a little crazy and shaved my sides pretty far back. In the second Image the blue line indicates where I shaved to and the red one is where he shaved to. I'm thinking of waiting for the hair between both lines to grow out but I'm not sure. \n\nThe third image is my hair before I got it cut and I really liked it like that. How would I need to cut my hair to guide it towards that direction? How can I also cut it so it looks less puffy from the front? Also should I cut my curly hair wet or dry?\n\nThank you in advance! &lt;3",

Quit immediately. Tried a few other things couldn't stick to it.\n\nSo I ditched the drugs, did a little digging and decided on microneedling and red light therapy only. It worked and some of my grays are gone. I'm convinced this sub is ran by \"big hair pharma\" so it'll likely be pulled by the mods, but here are the results. (See photos) \n\nHair is brushed to the side, you can't tell from the photo but still a bit thin on top, I can notice it out of the shower but I'm going to keep up with it.\n\nMy regiment is microneedling with a 1.5 mm roller once a week and I wear a red light baseball hat on the way to work 5 days per week (about a 35 minute drive).\n\nGot the roller off of amazon and the cap off of temu for a fraction of the cost these assholes want to charge.\n\nClearly it works. Save your ween, avoid the drugs.\n\nBefore is March of 2025 after is a yesterday.",

I do my after-shower routine every day, and instead of showering, I wet my hair. I know it’s not very healthy to put products in your hair every day, but I’ve tried every possible routine to make my hair last another day, and it just won’t cooperate.\n\nI have mental health issues that sometimes make it hard to care for my hair. For example, I won’t brush my hair for 3–4 days, and I can’t always burden myself with wetting my hair and doing a curl routine over and over again. Because of that, I usually brush my hair dry so it doesn’t get too knotted. I already have somewhat thin hair, and a lot of hair tends to fall out every time I brush it.\n\nOverall, I just want to know if it’s okay to brush my curly hair dry once in a while.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
