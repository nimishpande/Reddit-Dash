      "title": "Curly Cut - Why no product?",
      "content": "Hi, I am wondering why hair stylists who do dry curly cuts require you to come in with no product? My hair is completely different with and without product. Without product, it is a giant ball of frizz. There are no individual curls. With product, I have clearly defined curls. I have never gone outside of my house with no product on my hair and I'm scared to. I've had curly cuts before but I didn't know you weren't supposed to put in product. Now my stylist is telling me I have to come in without product and I would love to hear why, so that I feel reassured that it will come out well. I looked it up online and it said it's so they can see how each individual curls falls, but without product, I have no curls. Just frizz. I'm worried they will not cut my hair in the way I normally wear it.  Photo of how I usually style my hair. Thanks!\n\nRoutine:\n\nWash with Dove Intensive Shampoo\nCondition with John Frieda Ultra Volume\nIn shower, apply Not Your Mother's Curl Gel\nOutside shower, apply AG re:coil and scrunch\nChi Heat protecting spray \nDiffuse \nSleep with a silk bonnet, never towel dry, rather brush with a Denman\n\nAnd if anyone has further advice to get rid of the frizz, I'm all ears 😁 Thank you!",

For almost my whole childhood, my parents treated my hair as straight hair (brushing it through etc etc) and i always thought i just had frizzy hair but only like this year have i realized that OH! my hair is wavy/curly.  \nMy brothers hair is like really curly too but it's short so he's useless for advice.\n\nOn a good day (days i shower) the curls are pretty prominent, however my hair is still really frizzy after it dries. But then when i sleep it becomes a tanged mess ofcourse and is untamable. I use the TRESemmé bouncy curls shampoo and Coditioner (i dont really have the option of looking for something better because we dont really have the money to finance it).\n\nmy hair also really dry i believe so i need tips on how to hydrate it?  \nI have a really busy routine so it's really hard to even shower for a long time.\n\nI dont really know what to do to maintain these curls. On days that i havent showered they are a wild jungle of a mess and i get frustrated and brush them through which looks like really ugly.\n\ni think it's a combination of dry hair and my lack of knowledge because despite so many things online i cant really understand.\n\ni believe my hair is 2C to 3A ish. Honestly, theyve got a mind of their own.\n\nHow can I hydrate them so theyre not frizzy? (other than oiling) and what type of routine do i need for improvement? is there something i can make at home? what is a curl cream and do i really need those fancy products?  \nAlso how do i keep my hair from not descending into a tangled mess overnight?\n\nAlso im looking for haircut options for me. my hair comes to like just above my mid back. Would layers be good to lessen the volume?",

But I'm not sure which to get. I struggle with basic hygiene sometimes so I'm not looking for a long routine but maybe two from there? Cleanser and moisturizer?

There’s a lot more straightened/barely wavy pieces a day or two after that frustrate me sooo much! Doing a refresh helps but it becomes really frizzy and poofy towards the ends so I’m probably doing something wrong. I’ve watched like 10 refresh videos on TikTok idk what I’m doing wrong😭 It’s so annoying only having one good hair day until I wash it again. The other days I feel it looks too chaotic and this makes me insecure about it. I know it’s not ugly, but a lot of days it doesn’t feel pretty enough to wear down either if that makes sense.\nThe last picture is all the products I use. I’m trying to get away from not your mothers I feel like it doesn’t do much for me anymore. I’m iffy about native but it smells really good lol.

I’m so unsure of which ones to keep so I desperately need help. My hair is dark blonde and has never been dyed. It’s darker on the bottom and lighter on top due to the sun. I feel like this makes it difficult to find a shade match.\n\nOption number one is brownish blonde balayage and option number two is champagne blonde balayage. I choose option number one myself after doing some research on social media and seeing people with similar hair colors to mine using it. But I got recommended option number two by the retailer after sending them photos of my hair. My initial reaction is that none of them is a perfect match but I think i prefer option number one? Both of the colors are described as warm on the website but I feel like they look kinda cold compared to my hair.\n\nI’ve added some photos of my hair for reference and some photos of the extensions from the website and side by side with my hair. Most of the photos are taken in natural daylight. Unfortunately I’m not able to actually try them on so bear with me here.\n\nI would love any feedback and input! \n",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m about to start using minoxidil to help regrow some hair around my hairline. While researching it, I’ve repeatedly come across the point that—like many medications—minoxidil must be used continuously to maintain any results. If you stop, the regrown hair is usually lost.\n\nWhat I’ve been wondering, and what I’d really appreciate insight on from someone more experienced, is this: with newer and potentially more advanced hair-loss treatments on the horizon (such as PP405 and other emerging therapies showing promising results), is it likely that people would still need to use minoxidil to maintain the hair they’ve gained? Even if these newer “miracle” treatments become publicly available, would minoxidil still be necessary for retention of the hair that was grown using it?\n\nGiven how many new treatments seem to be on the horizon, I’m also questioning whether it’s worth starting minoxidil at all right now, if hairloss is not super aggressive and fast.\n\nAny insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, and happy holidays!\n",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
