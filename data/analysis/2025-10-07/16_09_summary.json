I just scrunch my hair and hope for the best (which, again, is what I’ve done two years ago).

      "content": "My hair goes through a decent amount of curl shock when it gets cut. I want to keep it trimmed and healthy, but I got into a bad habit of getting my hair cut right when it starts to look really good, and seeing multiple different stylists 😬 2 hair cuts ago, my hair still hadn't recovered after a month. I managed to make little cuts myself and things were looking good (see last post :) \n\nThough it looked good, it was super uneven, so I went and got it cut again 😅 I went to my casual but badass friend who has really similar hair. She did my hair 4 times ago, and it grew out the BEST. So I went back to her. I always get a quick dry cut with no styling, so to be fair, the 1st picture isn't indicative of her technique, but just to show what I was working with.\n\nMy hair has been getting dry and frizzy quicker than normal. I was having a hard time styling it and the curls kept falling. I was worried I got another bad cut. Last night I gave it some extra love! Here is my routine:\n\nPaul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo on the scalp, NYM green tea shampoo on the ends. Squish to rinse. Then I brought back my fave DC, Curls Blueberry Bliss. Kept it on for 5 min. Combed it and squished to rinse. The curl clumps were INSANE! Added a tiny bit of NYM conditioner and rinsed, just for slip. MORE SQUISHING. Glazed on some Kinky Curly Knot Today leave in. \n\nI ran a wet brush through my face framing pieces to smooth them out. My hair is really fine. Spritzed with water. Smoothed in my #1 fave, Treluxe Styling Serum. Then slicked the clumps between my hands with Umberto Gianni Curl Jelly. Some gentle squishing. It was looking like a bit too much product, so I spritzed in more more. Maybe. Little too much lol. It is a delicate dance, water and product, but I ended completely frizz free. At the last second, I scrunched in a tiny bit of Curlsmith Featherlight Protein Cream. \n\nI know thats a lot, but my hair needed it! I diffused on high as long as I could. Pic 1- after hair cut 2nd- 90% dry 3rd/4th - curls in their fluffed and filtered glory. My hair is sooo soft, clean, and well defined. I'm in heaven! ✨️",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

These serums are not only about wrinkles; they truly improve your skin’s texture, hydration, and overall glow.\n\nMost good ones have ingredients like peptides, niacinamide, snail mucin, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and plant extracts. Together they help repair the skin, support collagen production, and make your face feel smoother and firmer over time.\n\nYou don’t have to be old to use them either. Starting early, especially in your mid-20s, helps a lot. It is more about keeping your skin barrier strong and preventing damage before it shows up.\n\nI have been using an anti-aging serum with snail mucin, rice bran ceramides, and beta-glucan, and my skin feels stronger, more hydrated, and more even-toned than ever before.\n\nIf you haven’t added a good anti-aging serum to your routine yet, you’re honestly missing out.

I got it straightened, cut side swept bangs, and put beautiful highlights in my hair. I absolutely love when it’s straight as it’s easy to manage. But when I have it curly, I always put it in a pony tail. That’s because, even though I do know how to style and take care of it, it never looks right? I can diffuse it and use all the right products and it always ends of poofing up and shrinking horribly which is so embarrassing. However, I can’t keep straightening it because it’s starting to damage my hair. I also can’t get braids or anything because my curls are too fine. \n\nHow can I style my hair so it doesn’t end up poofing up and shrinking like crazy? Any advice for hairstyles and products? And how can I start loving my natural curls again?",

I decided to stop for 4 months, and despite still having a problem with anxiety, I felt an improvement. I reported this to my dermatologist, and she just said that she had never seen a case like this in her entire career and that it could be something else, etc. I asked about reducing the dose but she said it wouldn't have any effect and suggested that I resume the medication to test it, and that's what I did. However, I feel like my anxiety has increased again. Researching, I discovered that many people use smaller doses, such as 3mg per week, 0.5mg per day and others. Has anyone had a similar mental health experience that improved with dose reduction? I'm thinking about doing this mainly because I still have a lot of hair, it's just getting thinner and less dense than normal.",

      "content": "Hi all, need advice on how to cure these acne. Never really had acne issues until a few months ago.\n\nIt all started with a cystic like acne which was quite painful when coming to head. After the pus went away with benzoyl peroxide , I could still a lump underneath it. I had a steroid shot for the lump and it shrinked but when I touch my skin, I could still feel it. Occasionally it would appear red as well.\n\nSubsequently I started getting these red acnes around the same spot and I noticed that it’s always during my period. I suspect it may be due to a short course of traditional Chinese medication (which I have stopped) to regulate my body so that my periods could be more regular.\n\nWhenever these acne appear now, it takes a long time for them to heal and it always feels like there’s still a bump under my skin. Initially I thought it’s post inflammatory erythema but now I’m concerned if I’m suffering from hormonal acne and if I should start on accutane. I’ve tried benzoyl peroxide, differin, clindamycin but nothing works.\n\nI have a wedding shoot coming up April 2026 and my skin is stressing me out!!",

I know it’s normal to have multiple different patterns but I also feel like my hair was not always like this. My curls used to be uniform across my head through adolescence and young adulthood. I have been going grey since I was 14 but in recent years the grey has increased exponentially. I’m unsure if the differing curl patterns are a result of the increased concentration of grey hair, my pattern just changing as I age, or that I put constant stress on the front of my hair. I will say that as a SAHM to 2 kids, it feels like I have worn my hair pulled back most days for the last 5 years. \n\nNo matter what combination of products I use or how much research/ time I commit to a routine, it’s not affecting the curl pattern of the front section. I have tried to finger curl the front pieces and pin them up to dry but the curls still fall out (I prefer not to use heat). \n\nCurrent routine: wash with Innersense Hydrating Cream shampoo and conditioner; Shea moisture strengthen &amp; restore leave in conditioner while soaking wet; Innersense I Create Hold gel. Then air dry and eventually scrunch with my hands.",

It tends to get worse right after shaving, but even when I have a bit of stubble, the redness and bumps are still noticeable.\n\nI shave traditionally with a straight razor and brush (two passes, lathered shaving cream), keep good hygiene, eat a healthy diet, drink mostly water, and live an active lifestyle.\nI already use aftershave, but my skin still gets irritated and red, and I’d like to calm it down and improve the overall texture.\n\nAny suggestions for products, ingredients, or routines that could help reduce redness and breakouts?\nThanks a lot in advance ",

      "content": "Okay so, I’ve seen a lot of people talk about Vitamin C serums but not all Vitamin C types are the same. The one that’s trending lately... Ethyl Ascorbic Acid (EAA),  is actually one of the more stable and effective forms. It’s a derivative of pure Vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid) but way less irritating and more shelf-stable.\n\nWhen you apply it on your skin, it basically does three big things:\n\n1. Fades dark spots &amp; pigmentation: EAA helps block the enzyme (tyrosinase) that causes melanin overproduction, which means your existing dark spots, acne marks, and uneven tone start fading over time.\n\n\n2. Boosts glow &amp; brightness: It helps your skin look more “awake” and luminous because Vitamin C supports collagen synthesis and improves overall texture.\n\n\n3. Protects against sun damage &amp; pollution: It acts like an antioxidant shield,  neutralizing free radicals that cause dullness, tanning, or premature aging.\n\n\n\nI’ve personally noticed that serums with 10–15% Ethyl Ascorbic Acid are a sweet spot,  strong enough to show results but gentle enough to not burn or sting. It also layers really well with Niacinamide or Hyaluronic Acid, unlike traditional ascorbic acid which can sometimes get unstable or oxidize fast.\n\nIf you’ve ever used Vitamin C and felt it was too harsh or kept turning brown in the bottle, EAA is worth trying. It’s beginner-friendly but still gives that real “glow from within” effect if you stay consistent.\n",

I've never used any kind of toner before but I've used other cleansers. \n\nI was just wondering if I've somehow done something to damage my skin barrier? If so would it be fixable with the byoma gel moisturizer?
