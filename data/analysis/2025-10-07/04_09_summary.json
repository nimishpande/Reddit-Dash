      "content": "My hair goes through a decent amount of curl shock when it gets cut. I want to keep it trimmed and healthy, but I got into a bad habit of getting my hair cut right when it starts to look really good, and seeing multiple different stylists 😬 2 hair cuts ago, my hair still hadn't recovered after a month. I managed to make little cuts myself and things were looking good (see last post :) \n\nThough it looked good, it was super uneven, so I went and got it cut again 😅 I went to my casual but badass friend who has really similar hair. She did my hair 4 times ago, and it grew out the BEST. So I went back to her. I always get a quick dry cut with no styling, so to be fair, the 1st picture isn't indicative of her technique, but just to show what I was working with.\n\nMy hair has been getting dry and frizzy quicker than normal. I was having a hard time styling it and the curls kept falling. I was worried I got another bad cut. Last night I gave it some extra love! Here is my routine:\n\nPaul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo on the scalp, NYM green tea shampoo on the ends. Squish to rinse. Then I brought back my fave DC, Curls Blueberry Bliss. Kept it on for 5 min. Combed it and squished to rinse. The curl clumps were INSANE! Added a tiny bit of NYM conditioner and rinsed, just for slip. MORE SQUISHING. Glazed on some Kinky Curly Knot Today leave in. \n\nI ran a wet brush through my face framing pieces to smooth them out. My hair is really fine. Spritzed with water. Smoothed in my #1 fave, Treluxe Styling Serum. Then slicked the clumps between my hands with Umberto Gianni Curl Jelly. Some gentle squishing. It was looking like a bit too much product, so I spritzed in more more. Maybe. Little too much lol. It is a delicate dance, water and product, but I ended completely frizz free. At the last second, I scrunched in a tiny bit of Curlsmith Featherlight Protein Cream. \n\nI know thats a lot, but my hair needed it! I diffused on high as long as I could. Pic 1- after hair cut 2nd- 90% dry 3rd/4th - curls in their fluffed and filtered glory. My hair is sooo soft, clean, and well defined. I'm in heaven! ✨️",

      "content": "Hi!! This is my first post, I hope I’m doing this right.\n\nSo my whole life I thought I had pin-straight hair and was sooo jealous of my mom’s curls. Back in my teen years I tried every product and technique (thanks to OG YouTube) to get any kind of curl — and oh man, the results were awful. To be fair, I had absolutely no clue what I was doing and zero knowledge about hair care ahaha\n\nEventually I gave up and started heat-curling my hair almost every day for years. \n\nFast forward to now — I’m 28 and haven’t used any heat tools for 2–3 years, but I always do some kind of heatless curls method (my hair takes “shape” super easily and keeps it for days, if that makes sense).\n\nPIC 1: Hair air-dried with my normal routine (some kind of moisturizing serum, leave-in conditioner, and hair oil — I gently brush between each step to spread the product). It’s basically a bird’s nest. Straight but also so poofy and frizzy. Honestly could be cast as Hagrid.\n\nPIC 2: Next-day hair after my “heatless curls” method (aka a loose bun with a big scrunchie).\n\nPIC 3-4-5: Wash day (today). After seeing a post here — and still secretly hoping I might have a hidden wavy pattern — I decided not to brush after washing. I just sprayed some moisturizing stuff and scrunched in my leave-in conditioner. Air-dried (about 90% dry in the pics)...\nWHAT IN THE WORLD?? DO I ACTUALLY HAVE WAVY HAIR?!\n\nI’m so excited!!!! But I have no idea what to do next. I’m looking for any advice on how to build a routine and make the most of these waves. I know nothing. This is literally day one for me and I’m ready to learn \n\nWould also love product recs — affordable stuff I can find easily in Canada would be amazing!\n\nOther info:\n\n- My hair is very thick and there’s a ton of it\n\n- It’s always been dry and frizzy so I usually stick to hydrating products\n\n- I got highlights done (once) a few years ago, nothing else color-wise\n\n- I’ve got a couple split ends so I know it’s trim time, but honestly it’s pretty healthy despite it looking like a horse’s dinner\n\n**** I'm an autistic burned-out girlie that gets easily overwhelmed with online interaction so I promise I'll read every/any comment but may not be commenting a whole lot myself",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I don’t know what products or shampoos and things are best for my hair. My whole family has wavy or straight hair except my biological father who had almost Afro curly hair. I took after him but my hair isn’t as curly. My mom never knew what to do with my hair either so my childhood was filled with hours of straightening, just leaving it in a bun/ponytail or using products that chemically straightened my hair. I haven’t done any of that since I was about 16 however. I’ve let my hair do its thing since but I have no idea how to maintenance it. My hair curls nicely by itself on the lower layers but when it comes to the crown of my head, it seems to just frizzle and give up. \n\nMy Routine: I use the rawsugar brand of shampoo and conditioner (Restore and Clarify one), and have a leave in conditioner (By Marc Anthony) I put in after, typically letting my hair hair dry. I don’t have silk pillowcases or bonnets. I’m not even sure how to properly do all that 😅 I treated my hair as if it was wavy I guess. So I’m kinda starting fresh as I have no idea how this works. So any tips or advice would be awesome! ",

I could really use some help figuring out how to add the Anua Azelaic Acid 15% Serum into my routine without overdoing it on actives.\n\nI’ve been dealing with consistent bumpy texture on my forehead that’s actually worsened over the last few months (I got on birth control recently and my job has mold) \n\nMy dermatologist suspects it could be fungal acne and prescribed me Clindamycin Gel (AM) and a Sulfur/Sodium Sulfacetamide wash (PM, every 3 days). The derm’s assistant suggested trying Azelaic Acid or Niacinamide, but I’ve broken out from niacinamide before, so I picked up the Anua Azelaic Acid serum.\n\nMy skin has been through a lot of trial and error over the past year. I had allergic reactions to multiple Benzoyl Peroxide washes (finally figured that out after a long time) and got intense irritation from Tretinoin a few months ago (which hasn’t occurred since). I had to completely restart my routine, reintroducing products one by one over weeks.\n\nRight now I’ve been back on Tretinoin 0.025% consistently for ~6 weeks, using it every 3 days (alternating with sulfur wash nights). I was planning to increase to every other day soon, but now I’m wondering if I should hold off while introducing azelaic acid.\n\nCurrent Routine:\nAM:\n• Soon Jung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser\n• Briotech Hypochlorous Acid Spray\n• Clindamycin Gel 1%\n• Purito Oat-In Calming Gel Cream\n\nPM:\n• Soon Jung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser (or Sulfur wash every 3 days)\n• Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% / Sulfur 5% wash (every 3 days)\n• Tretinoin 0.025% Cream (every 3 days, not same night as sulfur wash)\n• Purito Oat-In Calming Gel Cream\n\nWhen and how would you recommend introducing azelaic acid here?\n\nShould I avoid using it in the AM with clindamycin, or is that combination okay?\n\n\nI really don’t want to overwhelm my skin after everything it’s been through. 🙈 Any advice from people who’ve balanced tret + clindamycin + azelaic acid + sulfur wash would be super appreciated!\n",

      "content": "I have 2c/3a curls. Ive tried so many routines and they just always look the same. I have no volume even though I use a volume brush and shake them out and do everything to avoid them being flat. I recently got some more layers hoping it would help but you cant even see them. The pieces above my ears are way less curly than the rest so when I put my hair in front it looks so weird. My curls constantly roll together into huge clumps. They don't last more than 3 days at most. I can't seem to feel comfortable with them no matter what routine or tip or trick I try.\n\nWould someone who has mastered their curls be willing to message me and try to help me out? I need to talk to someone who knows a lot about curly hair\n\nMy routine:\n\nI start when Im fresh out of the shower. I make sure my hair is really wet and section off the crown. I put a little bit of leave in conditioner and curl cream (I found that doing both works best for me) then brush style small sections with the Bounce Curl volume brush. I then do the same with the crown, going for a no part look but my hair isn't voluminous or short enough to actually pull it off. I then use mousse and gel on the entire head. I air dry for about 5-15 minutes then diffuse (hovering for about 5-10 minutes then pixie diffusing). I go to bed with the gel cast and shake/scrunch it out in the morning. I don't refresh in between wash days because it makes it ten times worse.",

      "content": "I started wearing full face of makeup like 4 or 5 times a week a few months ago, so I began to use oil cleanser to wash off the makeup. I recently noticed my skin being really red around my forehead, nose, chin and cheeks more than usual. I usually have fairly clear skin with a little redness around my nose and cheeks with some bumps on my forehead, but it has gotten so much more prominent. I have stubborn pimples and red dots on my forehead and cheeks that wont clear up (and these types of things usually clear up in a day or two for me).\n\nNow everytime I do my skincare at night after double cleansing my face (oil cleanser and foam cleanser), when I put on my skincare, my skin feels so even drier, hot and just tight. I currently use roundlab dokdo toner, hadalabo premium lotion and roundlab birch moisturizer.\n\nIs there alternative way to remove like a 'full face of makeup' without an oil cleanser and what are some products you would recommend to fix dehydrated skin?\n\nSIDE NOTE: The amount of times I wear a \"full face\" may seem crazy idk, but i just really enjoy doing my makeup and a full face to me is like blush, powder, concealer, contour and mascara (heavy waterproof one, so I have only found oil cleansers to really help remove all of it :( ).\n\nOther side note: I did recently move from the west to east coast of Canada, and my room is always very hot because of the lack of AC, so I always have my fan going... so I was wondering maybe if that had anything to do with my dry skin too....\n\nAny advice is appreciated,, thank youuu",

It goes really wavy instead of curly.\n\nRoutine includes:\n- Double shampoo every 3-4 days, no specific product as long as it isn't tresemme. Usually olaplex, but I switch to drugstore ones if I notice my hair getting addicted to it to reset it\n- No conditioner as I use k18, every 3 or 4 washes ill switch and use olaplex conditioner\n- Umberto Giannini curl jelly\n- Either air Dye or diffuse\n\nOther important info:\n- My hair is bleached blonde, get it touched up every 3 months or so\n- The bottom half of my hair is box dyed, I use garnier olia\n\nPlease help, what am I missing?",

Even when it's dry it'll puff up and become a frizzy mess so I just put it in a braid or ponytail and call it a day.\n\nAlso, my hair gets greasy SUPER fast.

I tried my aunts curl products and it seemed to make my hair slightly wavy but I'm not sure.

I’ll use the Tangle Teezer to detangle, the Wet Brush wide tooth comb to separate the clumps, then scrunch. I used to use the Wet Brush “Speed Dry Brush” and I really liked it. I mainly picked it out because of the design- I would have to worry about water getting trapped in it and it would dry quickly. But it had a major design flaw and broke so easy. I had to buy 2 or 3 of them in a span of two months before I gave up. \n\nI have both BounceCurl brushes and the Denman and I’m not a big fan of those. Maybe I just need to learn how to really use them to their full potential. I’m curious if you guys have any recommendations or what you use? ",

My problem is that even when my hair is wet, it still gets frizzy (wet frizz), and then by the next day, it looks super frizzy and flat and messy again no matter what I do.\n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations or routines that actually help keep curls defined for more than one day? Also, would you recommend getting layers for curly hair? I’m wondering if that would help with the shape and definition.\n\nRoutine\n\nWash no shampoo sometimes deep condition \nCamille rose leave in, not your mothers curl cream, camille rose gel \n\nDry with a shirt until about half dry then allow to air dry after I added products \n\nSleep with a bonnet on \n\n\nI half dry my hair using a cotton shirt then apply products and let it air dry, but I still have the frizz issue when it’s all the way wet \n\nAny advice would be really appreciated 🙏\n",

I tried chopping it down but I can only get volume and the back is still flat. \n\nAt least the layers of the butterfly cut make the front profile of my hair look fine hahaha. I've been a avoiding hairdressers in my area bc none of them seem to know how to cut curly hair (last time I went, I got a grandma cut 😬)\n\nIs there a way I can achieve this diagonal profile on my hair?

In this period, I've dated some people and the girl I'm seeing right now is a perfect fit for me. I've gotten compliments for my hair my whole life and to see it go is soul crushing. I will look like an infant if I go bald (have boyish features with large forehead). I'm trying to enjoy these moments of my youth, but its just so soul-crushing to lose it so young (not even close to 30). My hair now turns into a fucking tornado at a small gust of wind, while before it used to withstand a hurricane. I'm fully prepared to do a hair transplant, because I want to actually live and not be 100% invisible to women. The worst part of losing it young is that I don't have fucking money to do fin+min, dermarolling, a freaking 4k transplant. I'm applying everywhere, I'll work as a fucking janitor if I get money to save my freaking hair.",

The cysts are usually on the jaw, chin and neck. Comedones and blackheads are on my chin and forehead. I have combination skin for reference.\n\nI've tried accutane in 2020 (which helped significantly), spironolactone, birth control, and many other products.\n\nAccutane helped a lot and my skin was clear for a bit but the acne eventually came back, though not as bad as before.\n\nRecently, I've stopped following a skincare routine and keep it simple with my Vanicream cleanser and moisturizer, but that hasn't helped.\n\nI'm hesitant to get back on accutane or try a retinoid because of the purge. I realize the purge is temporary and that it might be worth it to risk it, but I feel like my confidence would tank even more, even if it's just for a few months.\n\nThat said, are there any products anyone recommends or any methods I could use to avoid a purge?",
