      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I don’t know what caused there to be so much doom and gloom associated with Finasteride but the reality is that the vast majority of people do not experience any side effects and the vast majority of people are able to tremendously slow or stop their hair loss from taking finasteride. Just going off of reddit, you would think over 50% of people experience side effects, this is not even close to true. If you really care about your hair, then just take it. You can always stop if you are the extreme minority that experiences side effects. But I genuinely feel that some people are so anxious and hyper aware about their “dick dying” that they manifest these issues for themselves or think they exist when they are not. It’s like people are waiting for a reason to stop taking it. I am saying this because Finasteride really works and is the absolute number one thing people can be doing for their hair loss and I feel like so many people are missing out because they are terrified of things that won’t even happen to them. If I could go back the only thing I would have changed is to start taking it earlier. ",

These serums are not only about wrinkles; they truly improve your skin’s texture, hydration, and overall glow.\n\nMost good ones have ingredients like peptides, niacinamide, snail mucin, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and plant extracts. Together they help repair the skin, support collagen production, and make your face feel smoother and firmer over time.\n\nYou don’t have to be old to use them either. Starting early, especially in your mid-20s, helps a lot. It is more about keeping your skin barrier strong and preventing damage before it shows up.\n\nI have been using an anti-aging serum with snail mucin, rice bran ceramides, and beta-glucan, and my skin feels stronger, more hydrated, and more even-toned than ever before.\n\nIf you haven’t added a good anti-aging serum to your routine yet, you’re honestly missing out. It is one of those products that actually delivers results when you stay consistent.\n\nWhat’s your go-to anti-aging serum and how has it worked for you?",

I already do the pineapple, silk pillow sheets, basically laying like a mummy in bed.\nI usually have to shower in the evening, bc of job and workout reasons and since blowdrying turns my hair into a Tina Turner type of hairstyle (even when using a diffuser) I let it air dry as best as I can before going to bed - I know it's not optimal but currently its the most practical. Even if I do my routine in the morning and let it air dry, my curls mostly look frizzy, undefined and overall bad. I wear my hair down maybe one day per month which is super depressing..\n\nMy current routine:\n- Clarifying or mild shampoo depending on wash day\n- Pantene hair mask, brushing hair at this point with denman brush\n- Rinsing out mask but leaving a bit in\n- Staying in shower, flipping hair over and applying some leave in conditioner as well as gel (currently EcoGel). Scrunching everything in while it feels like seaweed, making sure curl clumps form.\n- Plopping the wet, product treated curls into a microfiber towel, removing towel after 15-20 mins and let air dry\n\nI've noticed that my curls often look super bad at this point already so sometimes I brush them after taking the towel off, to make them a bit easier to manage for braid styles. I can get wavy/slightly curly to quite curly hair depending on how I treat it.\n\nI desperately need any advice I can get. If my hair wouldn't be this frizzy and undefined I think I would have already chopped the majority of it off..",

      "content": "I've recently gained an interest in caring for my hair and I think it would be fun to learn how to style it. I don't want to cut my hair, but I'm curious if it would make a big difference for my curls or not. The last time I dyed it was 5 years ago and the last time I cut it was 10 years ago. I think my hair is medium porosity and low elasticity. I have nightmares about cutting my hair and I fear if I actually did cut it, I would cry forever lol. But if cutting it brought my curls to my hair, I think it could be worth it.\n\nCurrent routine:\nI've just recently switched from head and shoulders shampoo (used for past 12 years) to Tea Tree Special Shampoo and I really love this new shampoo a lot more. I used The Doux Breakdown Clarifying Shampoo 3 weeks ago and I really liked it and will probably use that once a month or less depending on how my hair feels. For the past 5 years I've been using Aussie Miracle Moist Conditioner, but I've been wanting to play with new conditioners so in the first 2 pictures I have Tgin Green Tea Super Moist leave in Conditioner, and in the last picture I have the Aussie Conditioner in my hair. Whichever Conditioner I'm using, I always brush it through my hair and then scrunch it in at the ends, then I scrunch with a towel and then I air dry. In the last picture I used Curlsmith Hold me Softly Style Balm. In the first and second picture it's just the tgin conditioner.",

I noticed my skin started messing up when my parents split and I moved into my grandmothers house. I was super stressed/ sad/ anxious and I wasn’t able to use my products. Instead I was constantly using really random face washes. (I had no where to keep my stuff)\nIt’s been about a month since I moved into my apartment and my skin still looks like this! \nI just bought my clarify and cleansing bar again yesterday so I’m hopefully but I’m still so confused and It’s really effecting my self esteem.

They always scar, doesn't matter if i pop them or not. I have been using a variety of skincare items through the years and honestly nothing works, at all.\nI am guessing this has to be a hormonal issue since i use anti-acne products religiously and they STILL show up.\n\nI see no correlation to my period as they show up randomly during my cycle. I just need help on what to try next. I am considering birth control but the side effects scare me lol.\nI am also trying to track down what i eat in case its a nutrition deal. I do tend to have a sweet tooth, I have lowered my sugar intake recently.\n\nAcne only shows up on my jaw and cheeks. Rarely on my boobs and forehead and never on my T-Zone.  Some of them hurt, they mostly dont. They are always red and get redder with heat, my skin looks the best when its cold. I use acne patches to avoid touching them but if they are too painful i will eventually pop them, i am only human.\n\n\n\n\nList of what I am currently using 👇\n☀️ Corsx Good morning BHA Gel face wash \n\n☀️ Hada Labo Gokujun Hyaluronic Acid Lotion light (basically a hydrating toner)\n\n☀️SoonJung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream \n\n🌤️ Biore UV Aqua SPF50 (my beloved sunscreen ran out)\n\n\n\n🌙 Differin Maximum Strength Acne Foam Face Wash 10%\n\n🌙Hada Labo Gokujun Hyaluronic Acid Lotion light\n\n\n\nThese I put on randomly tbh\n⚡️Dermalogica Acne Biotic Moisturizer \n\n⚡️Dermalogica Bio-C aging whatever\n\n⚡️Avarelle Acne patches \nI absolutely love these and recommend them. They reaally suck out the gunk from ugly pimples\n\n⚡️Tretinoin retinol 0.05% cream (used as a spot treatment\n\n⚡️Dalatina (Topical clindamycin, also used as a spot treatment)\nLast two are generic mexican brands.\n\n\n\nReview list of what I have smeared in my face 👇\n\n\n\n🥀Skin 1004 Madagascar Centella Face foam wash and toner\n\n...meh. I think it made my skin brighter, my neck is noticeably darker than my face and I tend to forget to wash my neck. Coincidence?\n\n🥀The Ordinary red Peeling solution \nNothing, might as well use water\n\n🥀Starface Acne patches\nGlorified stickers, useless\n\n🥀Might patch/ Hero acne patched\nBarely does anything, too damn expensive\n\n🥀Paula's Choice BHA exfoliant\nsmells kinda gross, peeled my applying hand a bit, barely peeled my face\n\n🥀Nothing\nIn fact, nothing happened, i did feel gross\n\n🥀CeraVe Face Wash\nNothing, really disappointed \n\n🥀Dr Thayer's Witch Hazel, Rose \nNothing, feels nice though.\n\n🥀Naturium purple ginseng wash\nNothing, funny looking tub\n\n🥀Generic rattlesnake oil soap bar\nThis shit DRIES my skin in a way that i like, no effect on my acne though\n\n🥀Generic black african soap (like an actual one that is brown and not black)\nAlso super drying, I can feel my face and hands tightening like crazy. Like it, but no effect on acne\n\n🥀Aprilskin Artemisa rice toner\nNothing, felt nice \n\n🥀Aprilskin Calendula face wash, peel, serum etc.\nYet again, no effect.\n\nIm tired man, should i start saving up for a derm?",

Not necessarily that short (never shorter than my collar bone), but that shape. It doesn’t wash out, doesn’t bounce back…like magic, my waves are gone and I have this straight hair that bows inward around my head. \n\nIt doesn’t matter what routine I use at home after this, my hair texture is just completely different. I think it would bounce back if I would get my haircut again but I’d have to lose too many inches for it to be worth it.\n\nI’m shocked they are able to so permanently disappear my waves and have no clue why they think this is okay. But I just want to know if it’s the razors or some other technique they’re doing to me to achieve this. Because it doesn’t matter what I say or show them as inspiration. \n\nWhat technique makes this happen and how?",

I know it’s normal to have multiple different patterns but I also feel like my hair was not always like this. My curls used to be uniform across my head through adolescence and young adulthood. I have been going grey since I was 14 but in recent years the grey has increased exponentially. I’m unsure if the differing curl patterns are a result of the increased concentration of grey hair, my pattern just changing as I age, or that I put constant stress on the front of my hair.

      "content": "Okay so, I’ve seen a lot of people talk about Vitamin C serums but not all Vitamin C types are the same. The one that’s trending lately... Ethyl Ascorbic Acid (EAA),  is actually one of the more stable and effective forms. It’s a derivative of pure Vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid) but way less irritating and more shelf-stable.\n\nWhen you apply it on your skin, it basically does three big things:\n\n1. Fades dark spots &amp; pigmentation: EAA helps block the enzyme (tyrosinase) that causes melanin overproduction, which means your existing dark spots, acne marks, and uneven tone start fading over time.\n\n\n2. Boosts glow &amp; brightness: It helps your skin look more “awake” and luminous because Vitamin C supports collagen synthesis and improves overall texture.\n\n\n3. Protects against sun damage &amp; pollution: It acts like an antioxidant shield,  neutralizing free radicals that cause dullness, tanning, or premature aging.\n\n\n\nI’ve personally noticed that serums with 10–15% Ethyl Ascorbic Acid are a sweet spot,  strong enough to show results but gentle enough to not burn or sting. It also layers really well with Niacinamide or Hyaluronic Acid, unlike traditional ascorbic acid which can sometimes get unstable or oxidize fast.\n\nIf you’ve ever used Vitamin C and felt it was too harsh or kept turning brown in the bottle, EAA is worth trying. It’s beginner-friendly but still gives that real “glow from within” effect if you stay consistent.\n",

      "content": "Hi all, need advice on how to cure these acne. Never really had acne issues until a few months ago.\n\nIt all started with a cystic like acne which was quite painful when coming to head. After the pus went away with benzoyl peroxide , I could still a lump underneath it. I had a steroid shot for the lump and it shrinked but when I touch my skin, I could still feel it. Occasionally it would appear red as well.\n\nSubsequently I started getting these red acnes around the same spot and I noticed that it’s always during my period. I suspect it may be due to a short course of traditional Chinese medication (which I have stopped) to regulate my body so that my periods could be more regular.\n\nWhenever these acne appear now, it takes a long time for them to heal and it always feels like there’s still a bump under my skin. Initially I thought it’s post inflammatory erythema but now I’m concerned if I’m suffering from hormonal acne and if I should start on accutane. I’ve tried benzoyl peroxide, differin, clindamycin but nothing works.\n\nI have a wedding shoot coming up April 2026 and my skin is stressing me out!!",
