To be fair, I had absolutely no clue what I was doing and zero knowledge about hair care ahaha\n\nEventually I gave up and started heat-curling my hair almost every day for years. \n\nFast forward to now — I’m 28 and haven’t used any heat tools for 2–3 years, but I always do some kind of heatless curls method (my hair takes “shape” super easily and keeps it for days, if that makes sense).\n\nPIC 1: Hair air-dried with my normal routine (some kind of moisturizing serum, leave-in conditioner, and hair oil — I gently brush between each step to spread the product). It’s basically a bird’s nest. Straight but also so poofy and frizzy. Honestly could be cast as Hagrid.\n\nPIC 2: Next-day hair after my “heatless curls” method (aka a loose bun with a big scrunchie).\n\nPIC 3-4-5: Wash day (today). After seeing a post here — and still secretly hoping I might have a hidden wavy pattern — I decided not to brush after washing. I just sprayed some moisturizing stuff and scrunched in my leave-in conditioner. Air-dried (about 90% dry in the pics)...\nWHAT IN THE WORLD?? DO I ACTUALLY HAVE WAVY HAIR?!\n\nI’m so excited!!!! But I have no idea what to do next. I’m looking for any advice on how to build a routine and make the most of these waves. I know nothing. This is literally day one for me and I’m ready to learn \n\nWould also love product recs — affordable stuff I can find easily in Canada would be amazing!\n\nOther info:\n\n- My hair is very thick and there’s a ton of it\n\n- It’s always been dry and frizzy so I usually stick to hydrating products\n\n- I got highlights done (once) a few years ago, nothing else color-wise\n\n- I’ve got a couple split ends so I know it’s trim time, but honestly it’s pretty healthy despite it looking like a horse’s dinner\n\n**** I'm an autistic burned-out girlie that gets easily overwhelmed with online interaction so I promise I'll read every/any comment but may not be commenting a whole lot myself",

I've struggled with this mop since I was a kid when my mom brushed it out and then had short styles as soon as she let me cut it when I was around 16 years old. I left it short (and cut it myself) for most of my life, but have been growing it long the last 10 years... I'm not fully sure why since I'm so dissatisfied with it, but I think also because I've gained a lot of weight after some psychiatric issues and I always promised myself if I lost the weight, I'd lose the hair too - that would be my prize. \n\n**I would love ideas how to firm up the curls or make it not look like it looks now in the absolute easiest way possible**. It gets very frizzy (I don't mind some frizz tho), but it's the partial stringy curls that drive me crazy. I DO box dye my hair because I have very little money to spend on myself and not dyeing it monthly is *not* an option. \n\nI know myself and I will not spend a lot of time on my hair. A very solid 90% of the time, my hair is up in a bun because it looks like this. Do I even have options? 😭\n\nRoutine: Wash &amp; condition with L'Oreal Ever Strong Sulfate-Free Thickening duo, scrunch w/ Miss Jessie's Coily Custard, air dry preferably/diffuse usually... also not usually parted in the middle",

I got my eyebrows done yesterday and my face suddenly looks… off??\n\nThe brow shape is fine, but the skin where the hair was removed is so light compared to the rest. It’s super visible and now all I can see is that patchy contrast.\n\nThen I tried shaving my upper lip and omg no. My lips suddenly looked thinner and my whole face just felt wrong. Like when guys clean shave and look like a completely different person 😭 I think the hair was adding some natural shading that actually made my face look softer but now my mouth looks like a man idek how to say it.\n\nI’m seeing every other girl shaving her face every other day and looking flawless, and I’m over here looking like a...\n\nWhat do I even do?

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I’ve always somewhat struggled with dryness and frizz due to color and heat damage, but now living in a new climate it’s become worse, especially frizz. I’ve been trying really hard to improve my hair routine for the past 6 months since I’ve moved and have had slightly improved results but I just made a new change to my wash routine so haven’t had enough time to see too much of a difference. I am open to any and all advice, and would also love some product recommendations to help PREVENT frizz! And to make my hair look/feel soft and shiny! \nIf it helps, I will add all my hair details below!\n\nHair history and care:\nI’ve been coloring and using heat on my hair since middle school, and I’m now in my mid twenties. \nAs of recently since I’ve been trying to take better care of my hair, I rarely use heat, only when I go out (also rarely), and when I do I use heat protection. \nI’ve also slowed down on dyeing my hair but I did dye it all black a little after I first moved so about ~4-5 months ago. \nI wash my hair every 2-3 days, ideally every 2 days. \n\nHair products I currently use:\n— In shower — New routine I just perfected but still in trial mode:\nDefault Shampoo - Redken All Soft\nDefault Conditioner - Redken All Soft\n1x Week in place of conditioner - Redken All Soft Heavy Cream Mask\n1x every other week in place of default - Redken Extreme Length Shampoo and Conditioner\n— Out of shower — \n1st: Amika Hydro Rush Leave-In Conditioner (apply evenly and brush through)\n2nd, only sometimes: Olaplex No. 7 Bonding Oil (apply with hands)\n3rd: (1) Bali Secret Hair Vitamin Capsule (apply with hands)\n— Styling with heat —\n1. Chi 44 Iron Guard Thermal Protection Spray\n2. After styling, Olaplex No. 7 \n3. Then, DryBar Final Call Frizz &amp; Static Control Mist. This was recommended to me at Ulta, but doesn’t do as good of a job as I’d like and I’m not a big fan of the smell. Need good suggestions to replace this!!\n\nThank you in advance! &lt;3 \n\n\n",

My problem is that even when my hair is wet, it still gets frizzy (wet frizz), and then by the next day, it looks super frizzy and flat and messy again no matter what I do.\n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations or routines that actually help keep curls defined for more than one day?

The cysts are usually on the jaw, chin and neck. Comedones and blackheads are on my chin and forehead. I have combination skin for reference.\n\nI've tried accutane in 2020 (which helped significantly), spironolactone, birth control, and many other products.\n\nAccutane helped a lot and my skin was clear for a bit but the acne eventually came back, though not as bad as before.\n\nRecently, I've stopped following a skincare routine and keep it simple with my Vanicream cleanser and moisturizer, but that hasn't helped.\n\nI'm hesitant to get back on accutane or try a retinoid because of the purge. I realize the purge is temporary and that it might be worth it to risk it, but I feel like my confidence would tank even more, even if it's just for a few months.\n\nThat said, are there any products anyone recommends or any methods I could use to avoid a purge?",

As a consequence I have a lot of split ends after a while (last trim was 5 months ago) \n\nI use shampoo 1/2 times a week, conditioner and mask every day but they feel always dry I know it's time for a trim. I use a cream after to define ( no gel or spray, it dries too much). Plus a small diffusor after (small blow drier). \n\nAny tips? Advices? YouTube links? I wanna avoid a mess.... Thank you. \n\n\n",
