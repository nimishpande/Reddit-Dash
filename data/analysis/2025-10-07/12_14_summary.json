      "content": "My hair goes through a decent amount of curl shock when it gets cut. I want to keep it trimmed and healthy, but I got into a bad habit of getting my hair cut right when it starts to look really good, and seeing multiple different stylists 😬 2 hair cuts ago, my hair still hadn't recovered after a month. I managed to make little cuts myself and things were looking good (see last post :) \n\nThough it looked good, it was super uneven, so I went and got it cut again 😅 I went to my casual but badass friend who has really similar hair. She did my hair 4 times ago, and it grew out the BEST. So I went back to her. I always get a quick dry cut with no styling, so to be fair, the 1st picture isn't indicative of her technique, but just to show what I was working with.\n\nMy hair has been getting dry and frizzy quicker than normal. I was having a hard time styling it and the curls kept falling. I was worried I got another bad cut. Last night I gave it some extra love! Here is my routine:\n\nPaul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo on the scalp, NYM green tea shampoo on the ends. Squish to rinse. Then I brought back my fave DC, Curls Blueberry Bliss. Kept it on for 5 min. Combed it and squished to rinse. The curl clumps were INSANE! Added a tiny bit of NYM conditioner and rinsed, just for slip. MORE SQUISHING. Glazed on some Kinky Curly Knot Today leave in. \n\nI ran a wet brush through my face framing pieces to smooth them out. My hair is really fine. Spritzed with water. Smoothed in my #1 fave, Treluxe Styling Serum. Then slicked the clumps between my hands with Umberto Gianni Curl Jelly. Some gentle squishing. It was looking like a bit too much product, so I spritzed in more more. Maybe. Little too much lol. It is a delicate dance, water and product, but I ended completely frizz free. At the last second, I scrunched in a tiny bit of Curlsmith Featherlight Protein Cream. \n\nI know thats a lot, but my hair needed it! I diffused on high as long as I could. Pic 1- after hair cut 2nd- 90% dry 3rd/4th - curls in their fluffed and filtered glory. My hair is sooo soft, clean, and well defined. I'm in heaven! ✨️",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

It tends to get worse right after shaving, but even when I have a bit of stubble, the redness and bumps are still noticeable.\n\nI shave traditionally with a straight razor and brush (two passes, lathered shaving cream), keep good hygiene, eat a healthy diet, drink mostly water, and live an active lifestyle.\nI already use aftershave, but my skin still gets irritated and red, and I’d like to calm it down and improve the overall texture.\n\nAny suggestions for products, ingredients, or routines that could help reduce redness and breakouts?\nThanks a lot in advance ",

      "content": "I've been growing out my natural hair color since May (this year) and I have around 7-8cm (which is around 3 inches I think). And I'm getting seriously impatient (I'm generally a very impatient person lol) since my hair is really long (mid-back when curled, straightened almost at hips). I really don't know what to do. I've tried so many things but no hair dresser can get me back to my natural color. I've wasted so much time, tears and money.\n\nHere's a little backstory: I dyed my hair (mid to ends were bleach blonde, around 10cm of virgin hair) copper in December 2024. Had it colored copper again after some fading in March. In May I wanted to get back to my natural color and well...the hair salon had literally no clue. They didn't do a bleach wash or color remover and just dyed over the copper with a brown that was two level darker than my natural hair (which is a level 7 dark dishwater blonde/light mousy brown). The result was almost pitch black hair. Then a day after that I went to a different salon for a bleach wash. Since then I've gone twice to that same salon for a demi permanent toner. Last time was a month ago. And it was way too dark. I've done the vitamin c method twice since then and I got almost all of the too dark toner out of the mid lengths but it seems like the toner is stuck in the ends (around 5-7cm). So, now my hair is a faded copper with 7cm of mousy brown at the roots and the ends are almost black and I can't get the toner out. The Vitamin C also faded some of the copper but the ends didn't change a bit. \n\nI've talked to the salon about this and the hair dresser just said it should have been lighter by now. And that she can't do anything about it. \n\nI can't seem to find a hairdresser than can actually get me back to my natural hair color and I really don't know what I should do. I'm really frustrated and desperately need some good advice please. What should I do? I don't know if I have the patience to wait years till all the dye is grown out but I'm afraid if I go to another hair salon, they will ruin my hair even more. I don't understand why no hairdresser can get me back to my natural color. I've seen so many people on the internet that were able to dye their hair back to their natural color. Why can't I? What should I do?\n\nAny advice is appreciated ",

In this period, I've dated some people and the girl I'm seeing right now is a perfect fit for me. I've gotten compliments for my hair my whole life and to see it go is soul crushing.

My hair now turns into a fucking tornado at a small gust of wind, while before it used to withstand a hurricane. I'm fully prepared to do a hair transplant, because I want to actually live and not be 100% invisible to women. The worst part of losing it young is that I don't have fucking money to do fin+min, dermarolling, a freaking 4k transplant.
