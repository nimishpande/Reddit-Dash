I was like ok because tone was commanding. Then when I asked her about some product she went out and started attending some other client. Then I was checking out some Skincare products then she came to us saying we are closing, Then me and my friend said it's 7:00 pm only why are u asking us to leave when everybody is there checking out some products. Then she said I will ask them too first u leave. We asked her why are u being so rude to us, then she said and I quote,\" tum jaisi ldkion ko mn achee se janti hun, kuch kharidna nhi hai bss ghumne aajati ho.\" I said this is your work u don't own it, u can't make us go out, then she said while shouting-\" kaam krti hun mn yahan\" I said yes then again \" kaam krti hun mn yahan \" I said yes then she said \" naukar hun tumhari\" I said mne ye toh nhi kaha aap naukar ho, then my friend come rescue and they had big argument in which she called us so many things  \" batamiz ladkian\" \" maa baap ne kuch sikhaya nhi\" ache se janti hun tum jesi ldkion ko\" \" kharidna kuch hai nhi ghumne aajati ho\" My friend continuously saying lower your voice, . She said \" bahar niklo yahan se kabhi aa mt jana yahan \" then I asked my friend to leave ki koi fayda nhi behes krke. When we were going out she came in the market outside the store nykaa and said while shouting \" batamiz ladkian kbh aa mt jana yahan wapis nikl jao\" while whole market was listening and seeing us, we didn't utter a word as we were in shocked why would she do that. Also mention this was happened in front of manager and she didn't said a word to her. Also I asked my friend who worked there and he said that this keeps happening her, and the staff here is ridiculous u should not visit this store. I filled a complaint against her at nykaa also wrote an email, but they didn't even revert back. Now I don't know what to do, should I do something or just remain silent now. This incident has effected me alot.",

Wrinkles?” 😅  \nThat’s when I realized she’s also become aware of her wrinkles.\n\nSo I wanted to ask: would it actually help if I bought her a **retinol cream or serum**? Does retinol still work well for someone around 45?

Since then, I’ve been exfoliating about 2–3 times a week. I tried the AHA 7 Power Liquid, but it broke me out in areas I never broke out before and left some scars.\n\nNow my jawline and cheeks are covered in small bumps and spots, and it’s getting worse every week. I’m scared it’ll keep spreading.\n\nHas anyone dealt with this before? Could it be fungal acne or a reaction to my cleanser/toner? What should I change first?",

When my consultation was done, my wife casually asked about her face. She had had these scars from her college days which didn't bother her at all.   \nThe doctor suggested her some treatments,which she got done eventually post some research and had a drastic improvement.   \nThe problem is that she has become a little obsessed now, almost to the point of addiction. She keeps going to the doctor every month or so now for something or the other. This is not a rant about the doctor, she is very sweet and sincere and great at what she does, she would even tell my wife to take it slow. My wife is spending around 30k a month on this.  \nI mean we're well off, own a house in a posh society on the golf course road in ggn. The money is not really a problem, in fact it's a small fraction of what we earn.  \nShe justifies it by saying she feels beautiful and feels very confident and has become more social now, but I feel that this is an unhealthy obsession. I mean, we're all ageing, it's the inevtiable truth.  \nI've tried to have this conversation with her, but she deflects it by saying Zindagi na milegi dobara and other similar bs. Does anyone else have experience with this sort of thing?? How did you tackle it?",

      "content": "for context, my GP has already prescribed me clindamycin + tretinoin acnatac gel to use nightly, to help fix my acne. i started using that around the start of october. since then, I have seen my skin purge which was expected and currently I think it’s at the point where it is at a standstill and potentially might start getting better but I’m not too sure — my texture has reduced, my redness is not bad as some of my prior days, and the sudden extreme oiliness which I got when I first began using the gel has basically gone away. obviously i still have a lot of spots tho, as none of them have really gone away aside from that. \n\nhowever, my parents are being really pushy about my acne and how my face looks. it makes me feel bad, because personally I feel like my acne is only mild and as severe as they make it out to be. so due to this, today we visited my GP again and she prescribed me oral doxycycline. I didn’t want to be prescribed something else as I’m already using that gel + I’m anxious about my skin + I like taking things slow… i also can’t tell if she was just handing me a prescription just so that she could make some profit off of it because she didn’t really listen to anything I said anyway. \n\nregardless, I need some advice whether I should start using it or not, based on the progress I already have with my skin and if it will interfere with the work that clindamycin and tret has already done, and considering the stage i might be at with it rn? and how/what it will do for my skin? i’m getting to the point i can’t stand looking at myself so i don’t want to make my skin worse",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
