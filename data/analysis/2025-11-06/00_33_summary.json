The Formularx Sun Relief Ceramide Silk Hydrating SPF 50 / PA++++\n\nThis is good. Hydrating, silky, zero white cast, and somehow makes your skin feel like it just got back from a facial.\n\nVerdict: 9/10\n\n\n\n3. Fixderma Shadow SPF 50\n\nMore like Thickderma. Great protection, but the texture could double as cake batter.\n\nIf you’re oily-skinned, this will have you looking like you moisturized with candle wax.\n\nVerdict: Best for dry skin winters only.\n\n\n\n4. Re’equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch\n\nMatte? Yes. Dry touch? Sure. Comfortable? That’s a no.\n\nIt’s like applying successively smaller layers of chalk.\n\nBut hey, it’s one of the few that actually controls sweat.\n\nVerdict: Good for Athletes. Functional, not romantic.\n\n\n\n5. Dot &amp; Key Watermelon Cooling Sunscreen\n\nSmells great, feels cute, and then proceeds to melt faster than your patience in Delhi summer.\n\nGood for “I’m-just-running-to-the-café” days, not for actual sun exposure.\n\nVerdict: Influencer energy, not athlete energy.",

I let my hair air dry and sleep in two plaits and a silk bonnet. \n\nMy hair currently has a deep wave that lasts all day, is very thick and below my shoulders. \n\nI’ve spent a long time trying products and I’m so exhausted. But I want to try again because I love my hair!!\n\nI shampoo twice and then condition. I was using the tsubaki mask but recently haven’t repurchased and I’m wanting something suited to my hair texture. \n\nPlease give me a routine and suggestion(s) if you have any!

My skin is not too greasy or too dry but somewhere in the middle.\n\nIn the morning I use:\n- Salicylic Acid Based Cleanser\n- Salicylic Acid Tonic\n- Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer\n- Sometimes, sunscreen (I live in an area with very low sunlight and the primer I wear has FPS protection)\n\nIn the night I use:\n-Micellar water (this is also my make up remover)\n- Salicylic Acid Based Cleanser\n- Salicylic Acid Tonic\n- Retinol Tonic\n- Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer. \n\nI exfoliate twice a week.\n\nI do notice a little bit of a burning sensation during the night after applying the Salicylic Acid Tonic followed by the Retinol and I am not sure if they should be together at all. I mainly want to use retinol for small lines and wrinkles on my forehead that I am starting to notice, as well as my smile lines.\n\nMy skin doesn’t look or feel irritated so far but I am worried about that burning. My skin does feel softer and healthier but idk if thats just the moisturizer doing the heavy lifting.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

      "content": "Hi, I (34F) hope to find a non-drying serum that I can use during the day to help with acne.\n\nMy skin is fair and pretty dry even in the summer, but I still get occasional breakouts, which then lead to post-blemish marks. I do not get a lot of breakouts at once (2-3 at a time), and they are not always in the same spot. While my skin can be “sensitive” to active ingredients, it is more likely to get dry/irritated from a product than to break out a lot. Not sure if that makes sense - I guess what I’m trying to say that I don’t think the products I use add to/create my acne, but I don’t think they’re fixing my problem and I would like to find something that can help. I don’t think it’s at the level where I need to get a derm involved.\n\nMy current AM routine consists of:\n\n  1. Cleanser\n  2. Vitamin C Serum\n  3. Hydrating Serum\n  4. Moisturizer\n  5. SPF\n\nI occasionally use a Paula’s Choice toner at least 5 min before my Vitamin C, but regular use can be too irritating. I use Differin gel ~3 nights a week and do mild exfoliation 1 night a week.\n\nAny suggestions as to what I can use after my Vitamin C in the morning? Bonus points if it layers well under makeup. TIA!",

      "content": "I (27f) have always had pretty good skin other than the occasional ‘period spot’. Back in May/June I started using a sensitive Retinol oil (attempting to tackle those fine lines etc) twice a week (bottle advises twice a DAY) - after 4 uses in 2 weeks I started to get a really sore patch by my nose suddenly. Stopped using it and pharmacist recommended hydrocortisone. Used this maybe 3 times- sore patch cleared up and all was fine.\n\nEarlier this year, I developed an annoying cough that after months of going to the GPs about, they diagnosed as likely asthma and in June gave me a blue and a pink (steroid) inhaler. With clear skin I used the inhaler as advised twice daily and after in around August that pesky sore skin around my nose came back. The skin was a little blistery and really flaky. Spoke to GP who advised I continue with inhaler but try the hydrocortisone again.\nSore patch spread and bumpy raw patches developed further out from my nose and the skin around and under my nose and nostrils was scaly af.\nAfter researching and finding out about POD I instantly stopped using the inhaler and Hydrocortisone. Continued to use my barrier repair Byoma moisturiser as my skin was unbelievable dry and flaky- skin got worse and worse. \nThen decided to stop using literally everything other than a mild Liz Earle cleanser in the evening and just let the scalyness sort itself out.\nAfter about a month of this I got sick of no progress and contacted GP again saying I believed it was POD. They asked to send a photo and then prescribed me Fucidin (NOT fucidin H) and said if does not work then will prescribe anti virals. \nThat was around 3 weeks ago and the scalyness has cleared a little but the little areas of blisters continue to be red and daily change from ‘just a bit red’ to ‘these bumps are burning’. Currently they’re sore and itchy and burning.\n\nCan anyone help PLEASE!? Do I continue with the Fucidin- do I try the anti virals? My GP seems to have no idea what they’re doing and have only done appointments over the phone and it’s IMPOSSIBLE to get hold of them. I’ve attached photo from today as well as one from 3 weeks ago to show lack of progress.\nHas anyone got any skincare recommendations that might help reduce the soreness?\n\nI get married in 6 months and I’m desperate to try and get it clear. I miss my skin care routine 😭",

Leave in oil\n8. Dry(but not really)\n9. Put in a pineapple looking way and sleep with it cuz I don't have time to dry it\n\nTo be honest, I am just really new to curly hair in general. Since I was young I've been told my hair is wavy in some way, but I was never taught how to even care for wavy hair, so obviously, I don't know how to deal with curly hair either. You can imagine how my hair, which was treated as straight hair would react to that, getting so frizzy and looking terrible. \n\n I've started learning about curly hair this summer. Started following routines and all: Tried just shampooing with normal shampoo I used before and defusing and hair looked like (picture 1), then I tried finger coiling it, which gave it texture but didn't give me what I wanted (picture 2). Over time, I got a new shampoo, a curl cream and a conditioner. So far, that's all I have. It would probably be enough, though I need a gel too, but it's getting better. \n\nThe biggest problem I have right now is learning how to style it cuz scrunching doesn't work perfectly for me, learning how to dry it without a diffuser(cuz the one I had dissapeared= was thrown out by someone who didn't know what it's used for) and learning how to sleep with it. \n\nI've tried hair plopping and that went terrible. For the past few weeks I've been using the pineapple sth method(T shirt and my hair is tied on the top of my head with a scrunchy). It's not great, but, better than most stuff I've tried. Help me out girlies. \n\nSome times my hair kind of coils up. I wish it did that in all the hair but it usually is happening only in the backside of my hair. They're cute though. I wish all of my hair looked like that, all of it.\n\nEven if you don't help I'll still have curly hair, I just won't know what to do with it. Btw, been trying to grow my hair in years. It never reached past my shoulders, but now after using hair oil and some scalp massage it reached past them 🫡 ",

      "content": "I guess this can also be a rate my routine lol. I started retinol / azelaic acid to take active control of random breakouts, stubborn sebaceous filaments, semi-discrete cheek blackheads that are basically a part of my everyday skin, and of course minimize signs of aging I’ve been seeing (going on 32). I’ve neglected real skincare since the pandemic which was already 6 years ago so I’ve reintroduced a lot of actives but am now more experienced with barrier care. Was looking for opinions from experienced skincare enthusiasts. As a side note I also started using Medicube PDRN serum out of curiosity but am aware there’s not much research backing topical use, so I know that part is probably excessive and have left it out of the list. \n\n###Morning\n* Kikumasamune lotion (**ceramide toner** for barrier)\n* Medicube **VitC capsule cream** (antioxidant benefits)\n* Anua **niacinamide TXA** serum (for oil control/radiance)\n* Skin1004 Probio-Cica ampoule (**ceramide/centella for barrier**)\n* Inkey List **polyglutamic acid** serum (my skin weirdly hates hyaluronic acid serum so I use this)\n* Good Molecules wake up **eye gel** (**caffeine + ceramides**, trying to make eye hollows less noticeable without expensive procedures)\n\n**Twice a week swap VitC/niacinamide with AHA/BHA**. I like the Paula’s Choice toners but trying to empty my GM overnight exfoliating serum; the GM might be irritating my skin but not sure yet if it was just coincidentally timed with a day I didn’t moisturize enough before applying ret. Haven’t looked into the AHA/BHA percent differences between PC toners / GM serum. \n\n###Night\n* I’m Black rice **toner** (gentle **niacinamide**)\n* Anua **Niacinamide TXA** (recently added)\n* The Ordinary peptide + **copper peptide** serum (forehead lines + under eye collagen stim)\n* Probio-Cica ampoule\n* IL **polyglutamic acid**\n* Naturium **Azelaic acid** topical 10% (pigmentation, redness, retinol booster)\n* CeraVe Resurfacing **Retinol** serum\n* Ilyoon **Ceramide** Ato **cream** (barrier)\n* Beauty of Joseon revive **eye serum** (**retinal** for lines/collagen stim for darkness from eye hollows)\n\nClearly I’m trying to take advantage of things that will more permanently clear blackheads, lighten pigmentation, stim collagen, soften fine lines, and feel plump/hydrated without being oily. I use a lot of ceramides to minimize irritation from actives but I just wanted opinions; just because my skin isn’t freaking out, is all of this still excessive? I’ve tried to be careful about which ingredients not to use at the same time but I’m just worried that maybe somewhere along the line there might still be some ingredients that I’m not benefiting from due to too many layers or something. I know VitC / niacinamide can be a taboo combo but I don’t experience irritation using them at the same time and I hear current formulations often don’t “deactivate” the other. I want to feel like I’m finally taking care of myself but I don’t want to find out half the stuff I’m doing isn’t really doing anything at all. \n",

      "content": "I’ve realized press on nails and me do not get along well. For whatever reason, nails that are supposed to last 1-2 weeks only last 1 day on me IF that. I have followed all the typical steps, filing and buffing my nail, using an alcohol wipe, even tried acetone at one point bc I heard it helped the glue with sticking (it didn’t). So I’m wondering, for those who have similar issues, what is your secret? I’ve read buying a protein bond and dehydrator together might work with helping the glue stay on at least a week or two, but I am hesitant to try anything considering nothing has ever worked for me. I typically go for the glamnetic fake nails but I’m literally taking them off easily by the next day if not a few hours later. Its frustrating because I’ve heard people (including friends and coworkers) rave about how their nails lasted weeks or they had to use a soak to get their nails off, meanwhile mine are falling off within hours (only exception is when I get them done at the salon). \n\nSo ladies, please help me. Am I going to be forced to forever go to the nail salon if I want nice long nails? I’d opt for painting my natural nails but as mentioned in the title I have wide nails which are kind of shaped like toes so I prefer fake nails lol. I am happy for anyone who is able to use a strong nail glue and have a good hold for weeks, but that is definitely not me. With all the glues I’ve tried I’ve accepted it’s me somehow. Thanks again to anyone who takes the time to respond in advance ",
