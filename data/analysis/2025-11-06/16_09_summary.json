I’ve been washing my hair with it for years.\n\nMy hair is dry as hell, thin, and flat af. Even after 3–4 days, it doesn’t get oily still feels dry and rough. I use Bear shampoo and Tresemme Smooth &amp; Shine conditioner. Haven’t oiled my hair in months.\n\nNow I’m starting to think this salty water has been slowly killing my hair. Will this cause hairfall or long-term damage? Is there anything I can do to prevent more damage now? Like should I start using filtered or stored sweet water for my last rinse or change my shampoo or something?\n\nAny advice from people who also have hard/salty water would really help 😭🙏🏻",

      "content": "We started going to a dermatologist since almost a year ago. I was having hairfall and my wife had accompanied me. When my consultation was done, my wife casually asked about her face. She had had these scars from her college days which didn't bother her at all.   \nThe doctor suggested her some treatments,which she got done eventually post some research and had a drastic improvement.   \nThe problem is that she has become a little obsessed now, almost to the point of addiction. She keeps going to the doctor every month or so now for something or the other. This is not a rant about the doctor, she is very sweet and sincere and great at what she does, she would even tell my wife to take it slow. My wife is spending around 30k a month on this.  \nI mean we're well off, own a house in a posh society on the golf course road in ggn. The money is not really a problem, in fact it's a small fraction of what we earn.  \nShe justifies it by saying she feels beautiful and feels very confident and has become more social now, but I feel that this is an unhealthy obsession. I mean, we're all ageing, it's the inevtiable truth.  \nI've tried to have this conversation with her, but she deflects it by saying Zindagi na milegi dobara and other similar bs. Does anyone else have experience with this sort of thing?? How did you tackle it?",

      "title": "[Review] Chosen mineral sunscreens + moisturiser",
      "content": "**About me**: Combination skin, hyper-pigmented, ageing, eczema-prone due to photo-dermatitis (aka sun allergy). Hot and humid year round. I look for cruelty-free and reef-safe products, safe for sensitive skin, easy to (re)apply, look and feel like nothing (not asking for much :D).\n\n**Routine**: Cetaphil gentle cleanser and moisturising lotion when allergy flares up. Else Skin1004 poremising ampoule, hyalu-cica blue serum, centella soothing cream + Moody DermaSoothe sunscreen (AM). \n\nChosen products looked intriguing: dermatologist-backed, minimal ingredients, no fragrance. I bought samples of a few fully mineral sunscreens and a water-based moisturiser. Could they be worth the high price tags? (Spoiler: nope.)\n\nMoisturiser sample cost ₹90 for 2ml sachet. Sunscreen samples were 1.5ml tubes at ₹150 each. Each sample had enough for 2–3 applications. I applied 2 finger-lengths for sunscreens, in two layers 10–15 min apart.\n\n**(1) Chosen OptiMIST WaterBody Aqua moisturiser (WRP)**\n\n\\+ Clear, viscous fluid, spreads and absorbs easily, looks and feels like nothing on skin. \n\n\\+ Nicely hydrating in both humid and dry weather, not sticky when patted gently over damp face.\n\n\\+ Soothed angry red allergy rashes and sped up skin healing.\n\n\\+ Fragrance-free, water-based, did not clog pores, did not trigger hormonal acne.\n\n\\- The price, tho. ₹650 for 20ml, ₹1300 for 50ml. A full-size bottle is lasts about 3 months with 1–2 pumps applied twice daily. I might repurchase but ration it for use only when allergy flares up. \n\n**(2) Chosen SAFESCREEN® Marina SPF 50+ PA++++ (WNRP)**\n\n\\+ Lightweight lotion, absorbed in 5–10 min, no white cast on light-medium skin tone. Similar to the popular Numbuzin sunscreen.\n\n\\+ Zinc oxide is the second ingredient listed. I did not get a tan or allergy flare-up after going outside in humid heat. \n\n\\- Unusually for a mineral sunscreen, some stinging and watery eyes. Also left a sheen and slightly sticky ‘sunscreen’ feeling, even more after reapplying. Face was drier than usual by evening.\n\n\\- ₹1,450 for 40ml tube. Srsly.\n\n**(3) SAFESCREEN® TINTENSE® Buff IST-26 SPF 50+ PA++++ (WNRP)**\n\n\\+ Tinted lotion, buff shade was a perfect match for my light-medium skin with neutral undertones.\n\n\\+ Also mineral filters (ZnO and TiO2), absorbed in 5–10 min, performed well like the Marina.\n\n\\- But also stung eyes, was slightly heavier on skin than the Marina sunscreen, that ‘sunscreen’ feeling. I am hyper-sensitive to touch, feel and scent, and would skip this kind of sunscreen despite the risks.\n\n\\- Even more expensive, ₹1,620 for 40ml. \n\n**(4) SAFESCREEN® Mum &amp; Baby SPF 50 (WNRP)**  \n**(5) SAFESCREEN® Polypodium SPF 50 (WNRP)**  \n**(6) SAFESCREEN® Go sunscreen SPF 40 (WNRP)**\n\n\\- No go. All heavier creams, took longer to absorb, looked greasier and felt heavier on skin, pricey. \n\n\\+ No white cast once absorbed. The Mum &amp; Baby one did not sting eyes. The Polypodium one was too dewy for me but might work for drier skin or winters.\n\nOverall a letdown. I really like the concept of compact, carefully chosen ingredient lists. But the performance was at best average for sunscreens, and the moisturiser is a luxury hard to justify. \n\nThe sunscreen that seems to be working for me is the Moody DermaSoothe Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++ Mineral with Ceramides &amp; Rice \\[[link](https://trymoody.com/products/dermasoothe-sunscreen-spf-50-pa-mineral-with-ceramides-rice-copy)\\].\n\n\\+ Super lightweight runny fluid, 2 finger-lengths absorb in seconds (no need to layer), equally easy reapplication.\n\n\\+ Looks like nothing, feels almost like nothing. Natural-matte finish, slight white cast fades away in minutes, leaves mu skin looking more alive and awake.\n\n\\+ No eye sting and did not irritate skin even with allergic reaction.\n\n\\+ I apply over moisturiser, this might leave dry skin too parched.\n\n\\+ MRP is ₹491 for 50ml, I got it at ₹280 on discount at Nykaa.\n\nHope this helps! I am curious about other Chosen products (dark circle cream, pigmentation cream, lip balm) but sadly no samples. Has anyone tried them? Any suggestions for other products to try, from this brand or others?\n\n\\[Edited to add\\] possibly unnecessary disclaimers: everyone’s skin is different and you may have quite different experiences of the same products, and of course please consult a doctor for medical advice or prescription products if you have eczema or other skin issues.

Ever since then, I have been battling acne on my chin for the last two years and it is driving me insane.\n\nI’ve changed up my skincare from focusing on my skin barrier to adjusting my actives to cutting out actives, I’ve changed up my diet to see if there’s anything that makes things worse, I’ve cleaned my makeup brushes religiously, I’ve worked on exercising more, I’ve tracked my cycle to see if it’s consistent in how it comes up with no luck. The pimples and even cystic acne has been constant for TWO FREAKING YEARS.\n\nHas anyone else ever had sudden onset acne after dermaplaning? Or just does anyone have any advice on how to make this go away? I’m at my wits end and willing to try anything at this point aside from accutane.",

The pimples are popping up around the chin and forehead area and I am guessing the breakouts are probably due to hormones more than anything.

      "content": "for context, my GP has already prescribed me clindamycin + tretinoin acnatac gel to use nightly, to help fix my acne. i started using that around the start of october. since then, I have seen my skin purge which was expected and currently I think it’s at the point where it is at a standstill and potentially might start getting better but I’m not too sure — my texture has reduced, my redness is not bad as some of my prior days, and the sudden extreme oiliness which I got when I first began using the gel has basically gone away. obviously i still have a lot of spots tho, as none of them have really gone away aside from that. \n\nhowever, my parents are being really pushy about my acne and how my face looks. it makes me feel bad, because personally I feel like my acne is only mild and as severe as they make it out to be. so due to this, today we visited my GP again and she prescribed me oral doxycycline. I didn’t want to be prescribed something else as I’m already using that gel + I’m anxious about my skin + I like taking things slow… i also can’t tell if she was just handing me a prescription just so that she could make some profit off of it because she didn’t really listen to anything I said anyway. \n\nregardless, I need some advice whether I should start using it or not, based on the progress I already have with my skin and if it will interfere with the work that clindamycin and tret has already done, and considering the stage i might be at with it rn? and how/what it will do for my skin? i’m getting to the point i can’t stand looking at myself so i don’t want to make my skin worse",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?
