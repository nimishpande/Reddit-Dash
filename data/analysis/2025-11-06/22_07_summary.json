      "content": "Hello, I (20F) am having extreme difficulty rehabilitating my hair. For context, my hair used to look pretty nice, but I lost a lot of it due to an eating disorder. Stress also caused it to thin, and when I tried to rehabilitate it by getting faux locs, my braider did them so tightly that a bunch of hair was ripped out.\n\nI used to straighten my hair weekly because I preferred it straight rather than curly—hence the heat damage. Some parts of my hair are now straighter than others. I’ve never been good at taking care of curly hair because I was so used to wearing it straight, but now I’m trying to learn how to wear it natural. It’s been really overwhelming because there are so many sources saying to use this or that, and to do this or that, and I feel like whatever I’m doing clearly isn’t working because my hair looks like shit, lol.\n\nIt’s one of my biggest insecurities. These are pictures of my hair after I got a big chop; I went to a hairdresser to cut off any heat-damaged parts. Does anyone have advice for products I could use, protective hairstyles, or whether I should cut more of my hair? Anything would help—thank you.\n\nMy routine..\n\nAs I am Bond Shampoo and condition. I shampoo and condition my hair every Sunday. My hair dresser told me that shampooing and conditioning is not a daily thing, if this is wrong please feel free to let me know.\n\nAfter my shower, I detangle my hair and put in a leave in conditioner from Mielle, I then twist my hair and put it in a bonnet. My routine is lack luster and shouts “I don’t know what I’m doing”.",

I’ve been washing my hair with it for years.\n\nMy hair is dry as hell, thin, and flat af. Even after 3–4 days, it doesn’t get oily still feels dry and rough. I use Bear shampoo and Tresemme Smooth &amp; Shine conditioner. Haven’t oiled my hair in months.\n\nNow I’m starting to think this salty water has been slowly killing my hair. Will this cause hairfall or long-term damage? Is there anything I can do to prevent more damage now? Like should I start using filtered or stored sweet water for my last rinse or change my shampoo or something?\n\nAny advice from people who also have hard/salty water would really help 😭🙏🏻",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Historically that worked well for me and my hair would dry like in the last 4 photos attached.\n\nHowever, I bleached my hair in 2020 and rebleached to touch up a few times until I let it grow out. I then bleached it again in 2022 and rebleached it a few times until I dyed it back to brown. I haven’t used any heat, bleach or dye since that point but my hair has never been the same. I asked a hairdresser if the bleached could have caused this, but she said it’s been too long since then and my hair should have repaired.\n\nThe first two photos are of my hair recently and my curls are weighed down and lifeless and my hair generally looks like it has less volume and thickness than before, even though my hair has always been thin and fine.\n\nFor context, my hair doesn’t grow longer than what is picture so I have cut my hair only a few times in my life, which I do myself to trim and shape.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice, whether that’s I need to chop it all off and start over or if I need to look at protein treatments.

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

The problem is that I've been wearing curtain bangs for the past few years and half of them literally fell out as you can tell. To me it looks horrible. Nothing frames my face anymore, my bangs practically consist of two thin af strands down the middle of my forehead and those babyhairs sometimes even create a bump under the longer hairs or push them apart. Any ideas on what to do?? Shall I go back to microbangs in a few weeks and cut the remaining bangs to the length of the new growth? Or are there quick hairstyles I can try without cutting that make it easier to survive this stage? I've been wearing bandanas and stuff, I don't have much time for styling these days 😞 What do you think fits my face? I'd love any suggestions really!\n\nPicture one is the new hair revealed, pic two is how my bangs look from the side and pic 3 is little ol' me.\n\nThank you 💞",

June 2025 i got SICK of it and quit skincare cold turkey, I feel like my skin needed a reset for a while (also i was just upset lol)\n\nA month-ish ago i had a red dry spots on my face recently (which I assumed were dry spots) so I started using this Geek &amp; gorgeous hydration station moisturizer 2 weeks ago, at first i started using it solo to see if im sensitive to one of the ingredients, but ive noticed i am getting VERY oily mid-day the day after I apply it. (the red spots were gone btw)\n\nAlso started using it with a cleanser a few days ago and same thing. \n\nApart from the oily film, i am getting a few CC's on my chin.\n\nI live in a humid place, the humidity never drops below 60% and it can rise up to like 85% every evening...\n\nI dont believe this moisturizer is the sole culprit but it really doesnt make it better, worse actually.\n\nI dont get why since this is a light gel-cream moisturizer, not a heavy cream. \n\nI maybe spit-balling here but i did read that this moisturizer is very humectant heavy, does it correlate to my problem and the humidity maybe? [Check out the ingredient list here](https://incidecoder.com/products/geek-gorgeous-hydration-station).\n\nNormally i have pretty alright skin, not too dry but not too oily, sensitive at most, I get pimples every now and again. Before I started using this moisturizer I did get a little oily but not NEARLY as bad.\n\nPeople who live in a hot and humid climate, do you even use moisturizer? what do you use? I really wanna quit it again cuz whats the point using something if it sucks haha \n\nI would REALLY appreciate the help &lt;3",

      "content": "We started going to a dermatologist since almost a year ago. I was having hairfall and my wife had accompanied me. When my consultation was done, my wife casually asked about her face. She had had these scars from her college days which didn't bother her at all.   \nThe doctor suggested her some treatments,which she got done eventually post some research and had a drastic improvement.   \nThe problem is that she has become a little obsessed now, almost to the point of addiction. She keeps going to the doctor every month or so now for something or the other. This is not a rant about the doctor, she is very sweet and sincere and great at what she does, she would even tell my wife to take it slow. My wife is spending around 30k a month on this.  \nI mean we're well off, own a house in a posh society on the golf course road in ggn. The money is not really a problem, in fact it's a small fraction of what we earn.  \nShe justifies it by saying she feels beautiful and feels very confident and has become more social now, but I feel that this is an unhealthy obsession. I mean, we're all ageing, it's the inevtiable truth.  \nI've tried to have this conversation with her, but she deflects it by saying Zindagi na milegi dobara and other similar bs. Does anyone else have experience with this sort of thing?? How did you tackle it?",
