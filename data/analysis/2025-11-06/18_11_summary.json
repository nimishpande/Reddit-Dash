The reason I am posting this is to gauge whether enough people are interested in pooling funds to make it viable and meet minimum order quantities from suppliers.\n\nShould we collaborate and formulate the mother of all hair loss solutions?\n\nWill update this post with the necessary research articles  and sources if there's enough interest in this.",

I use Bear shampoo and Tresemme Smooth &amp; Shine conditioner. Haven’t oiled my hair in months.\n\nNow I’m starting to think this salty water has been slowly killing my hair. Will this cause hairfall or long-term damage? Is there anything I can do to prevent more damage now? Like should I start using filtered or stored sweet water for my last rinse or change my shampoo or something?\n\nAny advice from people who also have hard/salty water would really help 😭🙏🏻",

Too little?\n- Any other suggestions that have worked for you to tackle this kind of acne?\n\nI’m a bit insecure about my skin and asking this kinda scares me, but I’d really still appreciate some insight and input, thank you :,)\n\n",

However, i don’t think it was this bad when i started using azelaic acid. My skin used to be clogged and i would get little spots (i think it was from my old moisturiser now ive changed things up) so i started using azelaic acid to try and unclog as its a mild exfoliant. \n\nI use the ordinary squalene cleanser, then the aveno cleanser, azelaic acid, aveno barrier serum, then the cetaphil sensitive skin moisturiser.\n\nI dont know what im doing wrong, ive been using it about 6 weeks and i feel like my skin is worse (in terms of big spots, not clogged pores) than it was when i started. Is it okay to just stop? Does anyone else hav any recommendations?\n\nJust after i first started using it i was put on som medication that can apparently mess with your skin as well as do its main purpose, i put it down to this, but ive now been off of it a few weeks so.. Could it be anything to do wit contraceptive pill? I’m thinking about all possibilities but i’m unsure:( Thankyou!",

I have been doing my own hair (bleaching and cutting) using professional products for bleaching and cutting my bangs and some layers with kitchen scissors. My hair has been getting more and more damaged obviously because I'm not a professional. I made an appointment for a haircut and adding colour or toner to my hair to make it look mote natural since I want less frequent maintenance. My hair was a level 10 with some grown out roots. I wanted to go to a dark blonde, being very clear that i wanted a very warm blonde. I also asked for a root shadow to connect my grown out roots to the new color.\n\nIt turned out full on brown. They added a color to my roots and a bit further which matches my original hair color pretty well but then they added very dark toner to the lengths of my hair? I said that I really didn't want to go that dark and showed the picture (see below) again and they said that they'll try to add some warmth. They added another warmer toner which didn't do much.I understand that the darkness of the toner will fade and since my hair is bleached it's hard to put in warmth. I just feel pretty sad that for a big sum of money (a fair price for the services delivered, but still a huge chunk out of my budget as I'm only a student), I feel uglier than before.\n\nWere my expectations unattainable or am I rightfully upset?\n\nI just feel so sad :(\n\nThey say next time they won't do it as dark but why is it as dark then now?\n\nBelow are before and after pictures and the picture I used as inspo for the color (and showed them many times).\n\n(I have nothing to say about the cut, they did what they could with me cutting my bangs too short some time ago. The cut is fine.)",

The problem is, I have no idea if it’s actually effective. You know how companies often claim their products have SPF, but sometimes they really don’t? I feel like Underated might be the same. I couldn’t even find any good reviews on YouTube or Instagram. Can you please help me with your opinion?",

      "content": "Hi! I’m a 29-year-old female with a medium beige/brown skin tone. I tend to scar very easily and struggle with hyperpigmentation and dark marks all over my body. I’ve had acne breakouts since I was around 14, and I still deal with the scars and marks they left behind especially on my back, chest, and arms.\nMy main concern now is the uneven tone and texture of my skin from these old acne scars and pigmentation spots. I’m also getting married soon, so I’d really love to even out my skin and get it looking clearer, smoother, and more radiant before my wedding day.\nWhat can I do at home as i can't afford to get it sorted professionally to help fade these acne scars and hyperpigmentation? Are there any specific products, ingredients, or treatments that work well for medium brown skin that scars and pigments easily?\nAny advice or guidance would mean a lot. Thank you!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

(all while still feeling soft the look is just more puffy) anyways so yesterday, i was able to get it on settings i liked again, hair was looking sleek and nice again and everything was good. unfortunately, yesterday there was a lot of heavy wind and rain and unfortunately a section of my hair on the more damaged side got wet, and then dried in that wet state so it was frizzy. \n\nthat being said, i tried to fix it when i got home but it wasn’t working so i decided to rewash my hair today (so this is now today and yesterday i washed it) and i usually only wash 2 times a week. that section of hair that got rained on is still looking poofy? it’s still soft but it just looks poofy in that one area but i don’t understand how to fix it. \n\nchat gpt told me its something to do with the cuticle drying raised, and that through a couple regular washes and drying on my normal settings it’ll go back to normal but im just crying because my hair always looks perfect and i dont understand how something so small one day like rain can ruin 2 years of perfect hair?\n\nsomeone please help me ",

When my consultation was done, my wife casually asked about her face. She had had these scars from her college days which didn't bother her at all.   \nThe doctor suggested her some treatments,which she got done eventually post some research and had a drastic improvement.   \nThe problem is that she has become a little obsessed now, almost to the point of addiction. She keeps going to the doctor every month or so now for something or the other. This is not a rant about the doctor, she is very sweet and sincere and great at what she does, she would even tell my wife to take it slow. My wife is spending around 30k a month on this.  \nI mean we're well off, own a house in a posh society on the golf course road in ggn. The money is not really a problem, in fact it's a small fraction of what we earn.  \nShe justifies it by saying she feels beautiful and feels very confident and has become more social now, but I feel that this is an unhealthy obsession. I mean, we're all ageing, it's the inevtiable truth.  \nI've tried to have this conversation with her, but she deflects it by saying Zindagi na milegi dobara and other similar bs.

      "content": "I (28f) used to use all kinds of products, including good stuff and pricey natural stuff like the biossance line at night (lactic acid serum and omega repair cream) and senallis hyaluronic acid serum in the mornings. I've tried many, many more. Every day, my face was too red and inflamed to go without makeup. \n\nA month or two ago I switched to only using two daily products on my face -- 100% aloe vera followed by jojoba oil, both night and morning. I wash with an oil cleanser and YTTP  Supershroom Calm Cleanser (also a new product so not sure if it's part of the solution). I use a little bit of The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% once a week after a shower to get rid of flakes and dead skin cells. That's it. \n\n80% of my redness is gone now, but I'm a perfectionist. My next targets are unevenness and discoloration -- I'm pale, and you can see purplish spots from old blemishes (one on chin above and some between eyebrows), burst capillaries under my nostrils, red dots on my upper lip from tweezing, and overall texture/pores. You can't see it in this photo, but I also have some lines beginning around my eyes and forehead -- I'm 28 and want to preemptively anti-age. Is jojoba oil alone moisturizing enough?\n\nThat said, I have no idea what products are worth trying to *add* to my routine without risking the redness and irritation again. I have a .01% retinol cream (Paula's Choice Intensive Repair) but haven't really seen results, but maybe because I don't use it often.\n\nThanks for any direction!",
