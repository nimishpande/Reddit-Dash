      "title": "I think my hairdresser is going to give me a different color because she doesn’t agree with what I want. What should I ask for specifically so she doesn’t do this?",
      "content": "(The first 4 pictures are of the color I want and the last picture is my hair currently)\n\nHi everyone, I need some advice and I want to make sure I explain everything clearly so everyone can understand the situation.\n\nI’ve been wanting to dye my hair magenta pink since September 2024, and this December I finally scheduled a professional appointment to get it done properly. My hair type is 4B, and I’ve tried to get this color by doing it myself FOUR times already. Every attempt didn’t turn out as expected because I don’t know how to do it properly, which is why i decided to go to a professional and pay over $300\n\nRight now my hair has long virgin roots and the ends are a faded ginger color from previous dye attempts. I’ve bleached my hair twice in the past.\n\nToday I had a conversation with my hairdresser (over text) about the color I want. I had already made the appointment before this, and shes already seen the color but I had a few questions on how she was going to do it, and if she thought she would be able to get me to that color. And after the conversation i genuinely think she isn’t going to give me the color I’m asking for because she doesn’t like it. Originally when I showed her the picture she made a face when she saw it. She asked me if I was sure I didn’t want to try out a different one and I told her no, that I was absolutely sure this is what I’ve want and I’ve wanted it for so long. Now back to the conversation tonight, she said she wants to do a bleach and then a “rinse out” to get my hair to the color I want. From what I understand a rinse out usually involves adding a different color first, and then letting it fade to get the color that you want, which is what they do for lighter or pastel colors, not vivid bold colors like what I want\n\nI told her that I didn’t think this really make sense for the color I want, because magenta pink is very saturated and vivid, not light or pastel. But she said this would be the best to get my hair exactly how I want it, and she suggested making the back of my head a darker color/darker version of whatever color she plans to put in for this rinse out in order to get it to “blend in” with the full color. I started getting a little frustrated because I don’t understand what it’s supposed to blend into since the color I want is solid throughout the entire head\n\nThis whole conversation makes me feel like she doesn’t actually agree with the color and might not give me the exact result I want, instead doing something she thinks will “look better” rather than following my reference.\n\nI didn’t want to push it and I didn’t want to upset her, (since you know I’m trusting her with my hair this December) so I just left it there and thanked her for taking the time to speak to me and I wished her a good day\n\nI want to make sure when I go in for my appointment that the hairdresser doesn’t change things up and I want to make sure I get the color I’ve been wanting for over a year, without any unnecessary adjustments or personal opinions about what “suits me.”\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on what exactly I should say or ask to make sure she follows the color I want? On how I can properly and kindly communicate my preferences clearly so there’s no confusion about any rinse outs, a darker back, and sticking to the vivid magenta pink I want? Are there any tips for getting the most vibrant result on 4B hair that has some previously dyed ends?\n\nI really want to get this right because I’ve waited over a year for this color and I’ve tried so many times on my own without success. Any advice, tips, or anything I can use with my hairdresser would be hugely appreciated.\n\n\nI don’t really have any other options except her, I live in a very very small town (I’m talking like one of everything and everybody knows everybody etc) and she is the only hairdresser here unless I want to drive hours to somewhere else and I’ll have to make a whole new appointment for that and look for a new stylist etc. \n\nI’ve seen her do highlights on people with natural/afro hair before and it always looks really good so I have faith in her.

      "title": "[Routine Help] I've been a soap (on the face too) and moisturizer guy all my life. But I've wanted to get an at least half decent skincare routine and I need some tips on it. Please give me advice!!!",
      "content": "So basically, my daily routine looks like this at the moment:  \nWake up, shower before school, moisturize/sunscreen  \nCome back (1-4pm), shower immediately (house rule), moisturize and call it a day\n\nQuick background info: I have combination skin (so an oily T zone, normal everything else). I wake up with my face pretty oily and nasty feeling (probably because of me using soap on my face). I'm planning on adding a double cleansing I also have noticed laugh lines forming on my face (I'm 19) so I'm hoping to clear that up a bit with retinol. I'm also not rich so this has to be affordable\n\nBased on what I looked up here's what I'm planning to do:\n\nMorning routine:\n\n1. Wake up, step into the shower\n2. Clean my body with soap or whatever everywhere but my face which is only touched by water\n3. Either step out or while still in the shower, do a single step cleanse. **Though I'm not sure if it should be with a water based/foam cleanser or an oil cleanser**. Part of me thinks it's supposed to be the oil cleanser because like dissolves like and all that but the other part of me feels like the water cleanser is the better option to avoid over stripping my face (or does that not matter as much here because it's just a single step cleanse?).\n\nEither way, after the single step cleanse, I moisturize with a light, non-greasy moisturizer (would appreciate brand recommendations) and finishing with a generous sunscreen application. I heard mineral sunscreen is good but right now I'm using a chemical sunscreen. From what I understand, the chemical sunscreen isn't going to give me super cancer or anything and is about as effective as a mineral sunscreen, just not as greasy or thick feeling, which I like. Do I have to switch to mineral or is it fine as is? I'm using Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen if anyone was wondering.\n\nEvening/Coming home routine:\n\n1. Come home, immediately step into the shower. Again, clean off the rest of my body except for my face.\n2. **Here's also where I need help**. I'm trying to incorporate double cleansing as part of my skincare. Do I do that now? If so, I'd do it now, and then moisturize. I'd then just apply retinol at the end of the day as part of my bedtime routine when I brush and floss.\n\nHOWEVER, with the way people describe double cleansing at night, it reads to me like a \"right before bed\" kind of thing. But then if I'm supposed to double cleanse at night, what do I do when I'm in the shower in the late afternoon/early evening? A single step cleanse? With what, oil or foam cleanser? I'd presume the oil cleanser to get the cream, sunscreen and grime off my face from the day though I'm not sure. Either way, in this scenario, I'd do that single step oil cleanse, moisturize, and right before bed, do an actual double cleanse and apply retinol, moisturize and then go to bed. But I have a feeling that's doing too much...\n\nIf anyone could validate what I have so far and help me with what I don't get, that'd be really appreciated. I don't know why I've been doing what I'm doing for this long but something has to change. Also, I'm planning on getting my retinol from The Ordinary, as well as the cleansers too: Squalane Cleanser for the first oil step and Glucoside Foaming Cleanser for the second water step",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

Leave in oil\n8. Dry(but not really)\n9. Put in a pineapple looking way and sleep with it cuz I don't have time to dry it\n\nTo be honest, I am just really new to curly hair in general. Since I was young I've been told my hair is wavy in some way, but I was never taught how to even care for wavy hair, so obviously, I don't know how to deal with curly hair either. You can imagine how my hair, which was treated as straight hair would react to that, getting so frizzy and looking terrible. \n\n I've started learning about curly hair this summer. Started following routines and all: Tried just shampooing with normal shampoo I used before and defusing and hair looked like (picture 1), then I tried finger coiling it, which gave it texture but didn't give me what I wanted (picture 2). Over time, I got a new shampoo, a curl cream and a conditioner. So far, that's all I have. It would probably be enough, though I need a gel too, but it's getting better. \n\nThe biggest problem I have right now is learning how to style it cuz scrunching doesn't work perfectly for me, learning how to dry it without a diffuser(cuz the one I had dissapeared= was thrown out by someone who didn't know what it's used for) and learning how to sleep with it. \n\nI've tried hair plopping and that went terrible. For the past few weeks I've been using the pineapple sth method(T shirt and my hair is tied on the top of my head with a scrunchy). It's not great, but, better than most stuff I've tried. Help me out girlies. \n\nSome times my hair kind of coils up. I wish it did that in all the hair but it usually is happening only in the backside of my hair. They're cute though. I wish all of my hair looked like that, all of it.\n\nEven if you don't help I'll still have curly hair, I just won't know what to do with it. Btw, been trying to grow my hair in years. It never reached past my shoulders, but now after using hair oil and some scalp massage it reached past them 🫡 ",
