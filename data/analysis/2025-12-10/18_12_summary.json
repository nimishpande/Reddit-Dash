Bali Curls Moisturizing Conditioner\n\n3. Bali Curls Hydrating Curl Cream\n\n4. Bali Curls Curl Defining Gel \n\n5. Bali Curls Bonding Oil for scrunch out the gelcast.\n\nI never had long hair and had to find out just after my early 40s that i have curly hair (i would say 2c-3a). It is very fine but it seems i still have a lot strands. I was going to cut that dry and frizzy mess short again until i learned how to maintain it after watching videos, search the internet and finally got a \"curlsys\" cut from a hair stylist knowing how to handle curly hair and teach me how to maintain and style it. I also learned that some things makes night and day like avoid friction and sleeping only on a silk pillowcase with a loose bun (also silk scrunchie here). It can get really on my nerves to maintain that mane but i just feel so much better now at my age with my longer hair and while in the beginning people said it looks terrible, now it is more the opposite and it is a great conservation starter to women and man.\n\nI am still searching for maybe some better products for my special hair type and try other things. I just bought the \"Lockenbox\" Christmas calendar with 24 tools and products to try for next year ;) My journey just began (even i am already a 47 years old man) and hope to grow the curls much longer and maintain them better. I still have some bad hair days with a frizzball on my head but now i know how to \"repair\" it. One thing for sure, even if some people try to talk me into a shorter hairstyle i am done with shorter hair.....at least until it might get thinner as an aging man. So far i think i still have some years to go. ",

My hair is thinning fast, including thick terminal hairs, and it’s honestly starting to stress me out a lot.\n\nI wanted to switch to dutasteride, but my doctor refuses to prescribe it because it’s not approved for AGA here (only for prostate issues). Dermatologists in my area also refuse to prescribe it off-label. So I’m stuck.\n\nDoes anyone know a reliable and safe source for dutasteride that ships to Europe / France?\nI’m not looking for anything sketchy, just something legit that people here have used with success.\n\nAny help, advice or personal experience would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks a lot in advance, and good luck to everyone dealing with this.",

      "content": "I am just at a loss with my curls T-T. I have really thick hair and layers. The first pic is my hair after being freshly cut and defused professionally. I can’t STAND the back of my hair. It’s stringy and flat and weird, and only curls at the bottom. I have strands that frizz and don’t define no matter what I seem to do. At the same time, my hair can look flat and weighed down, and only curls at the bottom in most places. I’m not sure what I can do. I don’t know if I should be adding more moisture or if I’m adding too much. How can I get my hair to look less weighed down at the top and in the back? Any help would be appreciated.  \nI usually use Herbal Essences honey shampoo and conditioner, but lately I’ve been using garnier fructis conditioner. I wash my hair maybe 2-3 times a week, or more if it gets sweaty. I try to leave in conditioner for as long as I can before washing it out and I always leave in a tiny bit. I only brush my hair wet, and I apply products while it’s pretty damp. Daily, I use OUAI leave in, or Sleep on it overnight curl cream. Neither really do anything, I still have a ton of frizz and weighed down looking hair. I shower before bed, and let my hair air dry 70% before I clip it up. I swear I could put in the whole bottle of product and my hair would still look dry. The second pic is a failed attempt at defusing. In the 3rd picture I included, I had used gel as well to style my hair, and I like the way it looks. It was completely air dried. It was also summer, and my hair always seems to be prettier in the summer. The fourth pic is just air dried hair after my normal routine. Any advice would be really appreciated. I’m not sure what my hair needs. Plz give tips!!",

I've been using the Thayer's blemish clearing toner and it does work well, but I've been trying to fight dryness and redness on my face. I pretty much have to use salicylic acid, so I'm wondering if there's anything that's a bit gentler than the Thayer's? \n\nCurrently, I wash with the LRP Toleriane gentle cleanser, exfoliate with the Dermalogica microfoliant when needed, and moisturize with the Real Beauty barrier moisturizer. My face is mostly dry, and my nose specifically is both dry and oily. I don't get what I would consider to be \"acne\" but I am prone to pimples if I don't use salicylic acid. I've tried to cut it out again for a couple of weeks now and I've gotten several pimples that don't show any signs of going away. \n\nRight now, I'm looking at the Peach Slices Acne Exfoliating Toner and the Olehenrisken detox drops. The Olehenriksen is a bit pricey than I'd like to spend but I am open to it. \n\nI also have very visible pores on my nose and I'm wondering if there's anything that can help with the pimples and make the pores less visible?

Then after I finish the next section, I look, and everything i just did is loose. \n\nThis is so frustrating. It’s been my whole life. I even took a course to help. Even if I spend so long doing it, it never works out. Maybe I have too thin of hair? My curling iron isn’t very nice. It is a Revlon one I got second-hand. Blue tips on it.

The products I used before and am using recently are the following:\n\nBelo Tinted Sunscreen\n\nNivea Micellar Water\n\nCeleteque No Alcohol Toner (although I recently ran out so i haven’t used it after that)\n\nGarnier Bright Complete 30x Vitamin C Serum \n\nOxecure Acne Mud (for my pimples)\n\nWith this, I need help to fix or build my skincare routine and also need it to be budget friendly since i’m still a student (20 yr old) hehe. I’ve been eyeing The Ordinary’s Salicylic Acid 2% Solution Serum and Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% Serum, but i’m hesitating to purchase because it might worsen my skin condition.

Normally Tuesday and Friday. (I exclude my hair from my daily showers.) Everytime i wash my hair, i use conditioner, leave in and oil. And every second time, i also use shampoo and a hairmask. The routine on a full wash is as follows:\n\nWet hair &gt; shampoo &gt; hair mask (5-10 min) &gt; conditioner(2-5 min) &gt; pat hair to remove excess moisture &gt; leave in &gt; oil &gt; let it air dry.\n\nWould you guys say this is somewhat ideal or is there any room for improvement/anything i should adjust?\n\nThanks a lot for all the advice in advance and cheers!",

I’ve done some rounds of PRP microneedling in the past but was wondering if laser or a deep peel might help correct this - or what else can help? Also any products I should add or take out of my current routine?\n\nAM - LRP Toleriane Cleanser Vitamin C serum with Ferulic Acid LRP Toleriane moisturizer Belif aqua bomb eye cream\n\nPM - same cleanser COSRX 6 peptide serum Ordinary Peptide HA Serum with added cosmetic GHK-CU peptide Same moisturizer/eye cream\n\nI’m also on a cycle of Glow peptide (injectable). I was using tretinoin at night until recently when I switched to the copper peptide serum because I believe they don’t mix - not sure if maybe I should alternate nights with those.\n\nAny help or ideas would be appreciated. I’ve spent most of my life looking in the mirror and hating my face because of my skin :(",
