      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Since then my curls couldn’t hold any shape so I always end up straightening them every week in order to look « decent » at work. I started to take care of my curls again mid October and this is the progress I made so far🥰 I feel more and more confident wearing my not-so-perfect curls everyday and looking forward to grow them longer!\n1st pic is my curls today, 2nd pic was two months ago when I stopped straightening my hair and the 3rd one was when they were freshly bleached and straightened.\n\nHere’s my routine:\n- Shampoo and Condition with Arganicare Coconut line\n- I use a coin amount of Lola Cosmetics Dream cream as a leave in conditioner \n- I finish my routine by scrunching my hair,put them up in a cotton t-shirt and let them air-dry. \nI don’t use gel because I hate the crunchiness . In the beginning of this journey I styled my curls with a brush but found out it made my curls lose all their shape so I just detangle with my hands in the shower while I still have conditioner on before rinsing.\nMy routine is nothing crazy but it works for me and I am happy to share it with you guys☺️",

      "content": "I am just at a loss with my curls T-T. I have really thick hair and layers. The first pic is my hair after being freshly cut and defused professionally. I can’t STAND the back of my hair. It’s stringy and flat and weird, and only curls at the bottom. I have strands that frizz and don’t define no matter what I seem to do. At the same time, my hair can look flat and weighed down, and only curls at the bottom in most places. I’m not sure what I can do. I don’t know if I should be adding more moisture or if I’m adding too much. How can I get my hair to look less weighed down at the top and in the back? Any help would be appreciated.  \nI usually use Herbal Essences honey shampoo and conditioner, but lately I’ve been using garnier fructis conditioner. I wash my hair maybe 2-3 times a week, or more if it gets sweaty. I try to leave in conditioner for as long as I can before washing it out and I always leave in a tiny bit. I only brush my hair wet, and I apply products while it’s pretty damp. Daily, I use OUAI leave in, or Sleep on it overnight curl cream. Neither really do anything, I still have a ton of frizz and weighed down looking hair. I shower before bed, and let my hair air dry 70% before I clip it up. I swear I could put in the whole bottle of product and my hair would still look dry. The second pic is a failed attempt at defusing. In the 3rd picture I included, I had used gel as well to style my hair, and I like the way it looks. It was completely air dried. It was also summer, and my hair always seems to be prettier in the summer. The fourth pic is just air dried hair after my normal routine. Any advice would be really appreciated. I’m not sure what my hair needs. Plz give tips!!",

      "content": "I'm 19FTM and never really had acne when I was younger, maybe a few spots going through puberty, so I never had a skincare routine aside from just washing my face with water and soap. Since starting hormone treatment (about a year ago) I've started getting acne as I'm going through male puberty and I have absolutely no idea how to combat this. All the basic products I see people recommend like Cerave cleansers are at \\*least\\* £10 and people act like this is cheap, plus the amount of people that have like 5+ products in their skincare routine.... ofc I'm willing to spend that money but I want to know it'll actually work if I'm gonna spend a week's worth of food on making my skin clear up :/\n\nRight now I just wash my face with the Simple cleansing facial wash but just ran out of it. I've started infrequently using St Ives apricot facial scrub too which I know is controversial but it seemed like the best option I could afford. I'm going to ask for some specific items for Christmas, so what should I get and how do I build a cheap, \\*easy\\* routine that should actually work to reduce hormonal/puberty acne? My skin is probably on the mildly oily side if that changes things.\n\nThanks so much in advance for reading and for any help!!!",

It's stunning to discover tastes you didn't know before after more than 3 decades on this shitty planet.

I did this as a loading phase to get to the 0.5 mg serum concentration based on my understanding of its accumulation in the blood and tissues.\n\nI’ve had no side effects other than the elimination of my acne, which I’ve struggled with since my early teenage years. I don’t believe I’ve had a single pimple in over five months, where before I had at least 4 to 5 on my forehead at any time. My hair has come back extremely thick and dense, and even darker than it was before. I always had blonde hair, but now it’s coming in very dark blonde/light brown.

My issue is that for the longest time I’ve only ever focused on finding acne-reducing skincare products, and because most of them have things that cannot be used with tret, I don’t know where to start when it comes to finding new products to use when I start the tret.\n\nMy current products: Caudalie cleansing oil, Caudalie vinopure cleanser (has salicylic acid), Caudalie vinopure serum (has salicylic acid), niacinamide serum, Hyaluronic acid serum, and Kiehl’s expertly clear moisturizer (has salicylic acid). \n\nThese products have helped my skin A LOT, and a lot of products break my skin out, so I’m really nervous to try all new products along with the tret. I have combo skin (my t-zone is pretty oily but the rest of my face is dryer) and have never been able to use any thick moisturizers.\n\nAnyone have any advice for products I should look into? I really want to prevent peeling/flaking, I can handle a purge if I need to.

I can't wear my jacket hood because if its down it just pokes out the front and gets in my face. if its in a pony tail or bun it fills my hood and it won't stay up or cover my head properly. Is there a crochet pattern for a beanie to solve this problem? A hairstyle? Please. For the love of God, help me. 😭 I usually wear a bun with no beanie or hoodie on. Or wear it down but it gets super frizzy and because of the hood, sticks straight out over my head. I use the regular girly girl method(no sulfactes, only brush with conditioner in. Wide toothed comb, leave in or definer, moose, gel and air dry as a routine. \n\n\nEdit: Thank you for saving my sanity. I have nobody to talk to about this struggle. Im crocheting a slouch beanie pattern and will sew either my silk scarf or silk bonnet on the inside temporarily.

I also have Aussie mousse that I sometimes use. I have a silk pillow case and don't usually refresh the hair much. I am also interested in protective hairstyles I could do on day 2/3. I know putting my hair in a bun/pony tail is probably not good for it.\n\nI've had so many different routines in the past and they always seem to stop working eventually.

      "content": "Please help! Currently dealing with a massive flare up after having used retinol every night, thinking my skin would be able to handle it as I was using the Kiehl’s retinol daily micro-dose and my skin was fine with actives previously. Admittedly, I think the product was also out of date as my partner first received it over a year ago, used it a couple times, and never used it again so I snatched it up 2.5 months ago and have stupidly been using it every night until about 1.5 weeks ago when my skin had this major outbreak (pictured) and is still like this now. Until then, I’d just thought I was purging as I was getting the odd cystic spot. \n\nI also don’t know if the acne is just from damaged skin barrier etc or if it may also be bacterial/fungal. I had really bad acne when I was younger and the only thing that got rid of it was accutane so I’m really hoping it isn’t one of them times again. My diet also hasn’t been the best coming into December however I wouldn’t say it’s that wildly different to normal.\n\nMy skin is currently super sensitive, tight and also very itchy around where I’m getting the white head spots and also all over my forehead.\n\nTrying to keep it super super simple if I have indeed damaged my skin barrier and want to get it back to normal asap. Also, if you think it looks like it may be another type of acne from your own experience etc, please do let me know! \n\n**Current routine:** \n*AM:*\n- gentle rinse with warm water \n- Cerave moisturising lotion (blue) \nI know I really should be adding spf but I’m now scared to try incase it makes my acne worse! \n\nI also take the Aegles Clear Skin supplement on a morning which was highly recommended online. I started taking it after the big breakout first appeared as I had initially thought it may be hormonal/gut-related and figured it can’t hurt to keep taking?\n\n*PM:* \n- Garnier micellar water with oil\n- Cerave moisturising lotion (blue) \n\n",

My skin tone is cool, so the warmth in my hair is clashing and giving me a such an “off” look.\n\nI’m hoping to achieve a cool, smoky pearl/ash blonde. Would Redken Shades EQ 7N and 7P be good options for this, either together or on their own? \n\nI should note that my hair (or anything) is virgin (lol). My natural level 6 was dyed black for about a year, and then a cpl of weeks ago I spontaneously decided to lighten it again. I bleached and toned with Wella 8A, but I’m now more interested in trying Redken’s toners instead of Wella.\n\nThanks so much in advance! \n\np.s. my hair is actually way lighter than the photo I just took… I’ll have to wait until tomorrow to get a picture in natural sunlight.",
