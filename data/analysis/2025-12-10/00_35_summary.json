      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

For context, before I already shaved my head bald since early pandemic due to barber closures and embraced the shaved look (been experiencing diffuse thinning and frontal balding since I was a teenager, I guess). Recently my new GF kiddingly said want to see me with hair, then due to my curious nature, I start to research about AGA and many things. After a few weeks, I decided to start with 1.25mg of oral fin and 5% topical min in late August. September was a bit of a messy routine due to my father going back and forth to the hospital ICU. Also, I'm adding a derma roller and then switching to a stamp once a week. Kinda surprised with the result just now. At first, I thought it was my bias, but when tried to collage two pictures spanning 2 months apart, it was clear there is progress. I just wish I could shown it to my recently deceased father, he jokingly looking forward to have a same hairstyle with me when I succeeded growing hair lol\n\n*My father died on age 75 with head pretty much full of hair haha Bonus pic of him added 💕",

Conditioner is aussie 3 minute miracle curls. I use different styling products but in these pics I used some curl cream and some deva curl strong hold gel (watered down into a spray). Air dry. I also have Aussie mousse that I sometimes use. I have a silk pillow case and don't usually refresh the hair much. I am also interested in protective hairstyles I could do on day 2/3. I know putting my hair in a bun/pony tail is probably not good for it.\n\nI've had so many different routines in the past and they always seem to stop working eventually. I haven't really found anything that works super well. My hair gets a bit greasy after day 2 too. \n\nI'd love any suggestions you might have. Thanks!",

I started on 2.5 mg of dutasteride daily for the first six weeks, and then switched to 0.5 mg. I did this as a loading phase to get to the 0.5 mg serum concentration based on my understanding of its accumulation in the blood and tissues.\n\nI’ve had no side effects other than the elimination of my acne, which I’ve struggled with since my early teenage years. I don’t believe I’ve had a single pimple in over five months, where before I had at least 4 to 5 on my forehead at any time. My hair has come back extremely thick and dense, and even darker than it was before. I always had blonde hair, but now it’s coming in very dark blonde/light brown. Happy to answer any questions.\n\nFirst three are after photos, and second three are before photos. It is in the same order: left temple, right temple, center hairline.",

It was going okay until there was a problem with the first time they applied the straightening treatment to my roots. I had to wash it and they reapplied it. When I ask them what the problem was, they said it was just a satisfaction issue (bear in mind there is a language barrier). The second time it happens everything is apparently going okay and we washed it and they asked me. Do you want a treatment to help with the hair? I’m like yeah I do. I don’t mind. So they put my treatment in the hair and put it under a heating device wrapped in cling wrap. \n\nThey end up washing the hair and it is absolutely bristle and split ended. The ants have like this white dots at the bottom and breakage is so bad every time I pull my hand through it. They obviously looked panicked but they were trying to convince me that it was okay but like having five people surround your chair at a salon is never a good sign. So my appointment that was meant to be three hours turned into over five hours.\n\nI voiced my complaints and they kept on brushing it off. I just realised I’m in a foreign country. There’s nothing I could do right now. They straightened it and it just still felt really coarse. It’s been 72 hours maybe a bit less. My hair is like slick straight down. Not what I wanted I did highlight to them that I just wanted to control the frizziness. \n\nI’m wondering when I can wash my hair. At first they said wait 72 hours and then halfway they were like wait a whole week before washing. I did a bit of research online and it said that to hair that was done properly and not over processed. I actually like I don’t know what to do. I feel like this really put a damper part on my trip which is really upsetting. \n\nPlease give me advice on how to save my hair, thank you",

      "content": "Please help! Currently dealing with a massive flare up after having used retinol every night, thinking my skin would be able to handle it as I was using the Kiehl’s retinol daily micro-dose and my skin was fine with actives previously. Admittedly, I think the product was also out of date as my partner first received it over a year ago, used it a couple times, and never used it again so I snatched it up 2.5 months ago and have stupidly been using it every night until about 1.5 weeks ago when my skin had this major outbreak (pictured) and is still like this now. Until then, I’d just thought I was purging as I was getting the odd cystic spot. \n\nI also don’t know if the acne is just from damaged skin barrier etc or if it may also be bacterial/fungal. I had really bad acne when I was younger and the only thing that got rid of it was accutane so I’m really hoping it isn’t one of them times again. My diet also hasn’t been the best coming into December however I wouldn’t say it’s that wildly different to normal.\n\nMy skin is currently super sensitive, tight and also very itchy around where I’m getting the white head spots and also all over my forehead.\n\nTrying to keep it super super simple if I have indeed damaged my skin barrier and want to get it back to normal asap. Also, if you think it looks like it may be another type of acne from your own experience etc, please do let me know! \n\n**Current routine:** \n*AM:*\n- gentle rinse with warm water \n- Cerave moisturising lotion (blue) \nI know I really should be adding spf but I’m now scared to try incase it makes my acne worse! \n\nI also take the Aegles Clear Skin supplement on a morning which was highly recommended online. I started taking it after the big breakout first appeared as I had initially thought it may be hormonal/gut-related and figured it can’t hurt to keep taking?\n\n*PM:* \n- Garnier micellar water with oil\n- Cerave moisturising lotion (blue) \n\n",

It gets slightly better when I eat reallllly clean but not significantly enough to make me want to do it.\n\nWhen I work out too much my skin gets worse, sugar and alcohol are obviously also no gos but I don’t consume a lot of either. I‘ve tried countless products, no products, lifestyle changes but nothing seems to help.\n\nWhat feels worst to me is that no matter how healthy a life I live, I look unhealthy in the face and I feel like people treat me accordingly when I‘m not wearing makeup outside. Can anyone with similar medical conditions/skin issues give me tips on how to acquire a healthy looking teint? The only time I look somewhat rosy is in the deepest winter/with the highest fever.\n\nThe acne might increase from sleeping on the side, but I‘m already washing my pillowcase often and use a second encasing for the pillow to uh imprison the mites so I wouldn’t know what else to do.\n\nMy face looks oily in the photos because I applied some face oil I just found in the fridge lol. It’s normally very dry in winter and oily?sweaty! in summer. Usually I use fragrance free face cleanser for atopic skin and neutrogena hydrosomething cream in the evening, just water in the morning before I apply my 50+spf cc cream.",

But now that I moved, I decided to let it grow a bit and now I have this medium length, flowy mullet that I want to wear with curtain bangs.\n\nI am lucky to have this natural wave/curl-ish hair, and recently started adopting a shampoo + conditioner routine which compliments my wave pretty well. However I‘ve been struggling with styling it.\n\nWhenever I use matt paste it just turned greasy. I started using some curl mousse for light hold which worked perfectly, however the next day the hair looks „meh“. I wonder, how do you refresh your hair without shampooing it?\n\nI am a noob on this topic and have been trying to listen to some tiktok gurus who recommend showering every 4 to 5 days, and ever since I did that, my hair doesn‘t look greasy on the 5th day. However it does look all wild and starts to lose more and more wavyness going after the first day.\n\nDo you have any recommendations what I can do inbetween washes? Like I want to achieve this typical curtain mullet that many people are wearing currently, with a long back and the curtains parting in the middle.\n\nI also tried using leave-in on the third day on towel-dry hair but that just made my hair look so greasy I was embarrassed of leaving the house lol.",

Today for some reason I put a fish oil and dutasteride capsule in my mouth and on my way to get some water to swallow them I forgot what I was even trying to do and just bit down on both capsules.\n\nAnd let me tell you: The dutasteride suspension tastes like the concentrated sweat from the wool of an old sheep, a shocking mutton like taste and at the same time it slightly tasted like battery acid. It's stunning to discover tastes you didn't know before after more than 3 decades on this shitty planet. This is like Harry Potters stupid mystery beans.\n\nWhat the fuck are the putting in our pills? Was that the taste of the dut? The (rotten?) suspension? I am enjoying the regrowth though.",

Detangle while conditioning, leave in conditioner, curl cream, Scrunch and finger curling after wash. Diffuse after wash with low heat and low speed.\n\nI just recently started diffusing and using a bonnet. The bonnet seems to have reduced my bed head hair and diffusing has brought some extra volume to my hair. I was messing around with the heat and fan settings but hot and high fan made my hair dry really fast and according to ChatGPT (not the best source ik) low heat and low fan seem to work well for my hair.\n\nI never knew about detangling hair until recently and about curly hair having to have to have this much maintenance so any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nProducts: as I am cowash, Camille rose leave in, ms Jessie’s pillow soft curl creams. Aunt Jackie’s curl custard. I’d like any products recommendations as well because I was using Cantu and Miele before but from what I’ve heard from my friends, they suck since their formula changed. They didn’t do much until I switched to my new products. I’ve heard mixed opinions on shea moisture but I do use one of their scalp conditioner. \n\n(Update I’m currently using as I am leave in and aunt Jackie’s curl custard until they run out. The leave in has coconut and idk if that’s good for my hair type and sometimes it feels weird compared to when I tried out the Camille rose leave in) also I’m using Camille rose shampoo and conditioner for my Monday wash days. I’ve been forgetting to use my bonnet lately but I’m gonna try to remember more from now on, I’ve heard satin pillow cases are good but don’t know where to get. ",

However, I went to the store to buy products for my mom and im thinking maybe I should invest some more effort into it.\n\nCurrently, my routine:\n\nMorning: la roche posay toleriane sunscreen\n\nEvening: Salicylic acid face wash and then CeraVe Healing ointment since the weather is getting dry and cold. Or Shea butter without additives.\n\nThat's it\n\nI have combination skin --- oily t zone and dryer cheeks. I am vegetarian as well, trying to transition to veganism currently.\n\nAny tips on where I should start and products?",

At first, I thought I wasn’t washing my face enough, so I started doing it once in the morning and once at night. No change. Then, my sister who just finished aesthetician school suggested a clay cleanser and hyaluronic acid (as opposed to a lotion moisturizer). That helped a little bit, but now that it’s winter my face feels so dry after I wash it, and an hour later it’s back to being oily. How do I fix this without going broke??? ",

I’d *love* to improve pore size and texture too.\n\n**My routine:**\n\n**AM**\n\n* La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser\n* Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant\n* iS Clinical Pro-Heal Serum Advance+ (almost empty — planning to switch to SkinCeuticals Vitamin C)\n* La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer UV SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n* La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser\n* Estée Lauder nighttime products\n\nI purchased this Estée Lauder set:  \n[https://m.esteelauder.com/product/707/137616/product-catalog/sets-gifts/skincare-sets-gifts/nighttime-experts-skincare-gift-set/repair-bounce-brighten](https://m.esteelauder.com/product/707/137616/product-catalog/sets-gifts/skincare-sets-gifts/nighttime-experts-skincare-gift-set/repair-bounce-brighten)\n\n…but it’s not going well. I think I’m reacting to something in the set.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n  \n**First few nights:** Totally fine.  \n**Yesterday morning:** Woke up with puffy under eyes and deeper-than-usual creases. Nothing wildly noticeable to others, but very noticeable to me.  \n**Last night:** I skipped the eye cream and used just the serum + night cream. My under eyes started lightly burning and feeling dry, so I added the eye cream for moisture.  \n**This morning:** Woke up puffy again — slightly worse — and still stingy.\n\nI’ve used Advanced Night Repair off and on before with no issues, and I use Estée Lauder Double Wear foundation without problems, so I’m thinking the Revitalizing Supreme+ Night cream might be the culprit (maybe fragrance?).\n\nI’m sad because I really wanted these to work, but I'm still hoping to build a really good nighttime routine that’s safe for sensitive, rosacea-prone, acne-prone skin and helps with fine lines, texture, and hydration.\n\nAny recommendations for gentler nighttime products or routines that won’t cause reactions?",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "I’ve always scarred really badly even if it was just a bruise and they last for weeks/months. Recently I have had a flea infestation take over my ankles and slowly up my legs. I have used everything from mederma, botox honey, pimple patches, bio oil, whitening cream, etc. I’m also very fair skinned (i’m usually the fairest foundation in most makeup if that helps) Being 20 and suffering with this my whole life i started tattooing over them but that is getting expensive LOL.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on products for old bug bite scars? I also have sensitive skin and I am a little scared to go and buy products just for them to not work or make the scars worse. I know time is the medicine for most things but I’m really tired of this controlling what i wear because of my fear of being embarrassed.",
