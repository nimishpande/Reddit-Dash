Umberto Giannini and LA Looks Extreme Sport round out the top 3.\n\nWanted to see what this sub actually recommends vs. what influencers push. Pulled 53,962 threads and ran sentiment analysis on 380,000 comments.\n\nResults that surprised me:\n\n* LA Looks Extreme Sport (#3) costs under $5 and sits alongside high-end products - drugstore holding its own\n* MopTop has the highest mention count (513 positive) but lands at #5, not #1 - being popular doesn't mean being loved\n* Olaplex No. 3 at #16 despite the hype - genuinely polarizing here\n* First 24 products all have A grades - y'all really know what works\n\nWhat's your holy grail that didn't make the top 25?\n\n**How this works:**\n\n* Sentiment model trained on 38k samples (\\~96% accuracy)\n* Comments where someone says they actually use the product count more than \"I heard X is good\"\n* Bayesian scoring - needs volume AND consistent positive sentiment to rank high\n\n**Limitations:** Sarcasm slips through, skews toward CGM products, hair type bias (what works for 3a may not work for 4c).\n\nData covers 380,323 comments across 53,962 threads from this sub.\n\nFull rankings and sentiment: [https://dharm.is/beauty/curly-hair-products](https://dharm.is/beauty/curly-hair-products)",

I like having short hair. And it does feel a lot healthier and thicker. All I can hope is that in a month or two it will grow out nicer. \n\nBut this is way too short. I showed my hair dresser the photos OF ME with my short bob and the choppy layers, and specifically told her i wanted to avoid my hair looking like a big ball. She seemed like she really understood and was even saying comments about how we are gonna bring out my curl, avoid flatness, add plenty of choppy layers… but i feel like it came out like a big shapeless ball anyway. It wont curl at all like how it did. Its shorter than I ever wanted. I feel like its an old lady haircut and i know its dramatic but i’ve been crying nonstop. This has completely tanked my self esteem and self image. I can’t even recognize myself, and itll take MONTHS to get to where I’m happy with it. I’m so so devastated that it isnt curling like it did before. I feel so sick and upset and like i cant even go outside. ",

Return both? (not the ideal solution as I’m not a fan of returning gifts - but one is from hubby and he’ll be happy to adapt) Also I feel like my hair takes a really long time to dry. Is that because of my hair type or is it because of the dryer?

Not sure if this is a reliable indicator of my actual hair porosity.\nThe area I live in has what is considered very soft water so i have not worried about it affecting my hair.\n\nI have tried no shampoo routines and curly friendly routines but my hair just always seems to look like the picture below. Lots of frizz and no definition.\n\nI have not used any heat or chemical treatments on my hair but i have started noticing that some parts of my hair that used to be tight ringlets have gone completely straight and limp (cant see it in the photo, thet are hiding at the bottom) and this has gotten me worried that the rest of my hair is set to follow.\n\nAny suggestions on how to fix my frizz and strange straight limp strands will be appreciated!\n\n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I do wash my hair every day, I can’t get away without it and yes I’ve tried the training but it just doesn’t work for me. I also used to be made fun of for looking “greasy” as a child so I have a little paranoia and discomfort around that which makes it hard to skip a hair wash even if I didn’t feel very dirty. \n\nI have never really cared about my appearance but I’ve lost 120+ lbs (397 to the 270s) I actually feel pretty good about myself and want to feel like I look pretty too. \n\nI can’t seem to get the hang of hair care, I’ve tried a few different shampoo and conditioners, from redken to rice water to olaplex and even the dove stuff everyone swears by even though it’s cheap. I’ve tried using oil (sparingly), leave in conditioners, and air dry creams. I use a weekly clarifying shampoo and an argan hair mask. I sleep on a silk pillowcase, my hair brush is a wet brush. I don’t like the feeling of brushing my hair while it’s dry. \n\nI’ve tried blow drying and straightening or air drying but I always have this little fluffy frizzy look going on that I feel makes me look messy and it makes my hair look dry? I don’t know how when I use hydration shampoo, \n\nIf I put it up I get a million threads of hair falling out and looking like I just missed grabbing them with the hair tie. I’m about to ask if they will just shave off the baby hairs at the nape of my neck next time I get my hair cut because I can’t get them to behave. \n\nAny advice to get rid of the frizzy stuff? I am starting to feel like I’m just not meant to have nice hair. It’s discouraging to know no matter how much weight I lose I’ll still be ugly lol. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\nI’m looking for genuine advice because I’m confused and a bit worried about my skin.\nI’ve been using tretinoin 0.025% for about 5 months mainly for acne marks and overall skin improvement. On non-tret nights, I was also using Aziderm (azelaic acid 10%).\nInitially, I expected purging and mild irritation, but over time I started noticing persistent facial redness, which now feels “stuck”.\nFor the past 6 days, I have completely stopped tretinoin and all actives, and I’m only following a very basic routine:\nCurrent routine (last 6 days):\nSimple Gentle Face Wash\nCerave Moisturizer or Minimalist 0.3% Ceramide Moisturizer\nSunscreen every day (Neutrogena or Re’equil)\n\nEven after stopping all actives, the redness is still present, and my skin looks noticeably red compared to how it looked before starting tret. I’ve attached before-tret vs current photos for reference.\nSome background:\nOily, acne-prone skin\nUsed tret consistently but not aggressively\nAlways moisturized and used sunscreen\nNo exfoliating acids, scrubs, or harsh cleansers\nAzelaic acid was used only on non-tret nights\n\nMy questions:\n1)Did I over-stress or damage my skin barrier, especially by combining tret and azelaic acid?\n2)Can long-term tret use (5 months) still cause redness like this, even after stopping?\n 3)Is  this more likely irritation, inflammation, or early rosacea-like reaction?\n4)What’s the best way to calm this redness and return to my pre-tret skin condition?\n5)Should tretinoin be reintroduced later, or is it better to stop completely?",

I just don't have the time or energy anymore to have to style it all the time. My wash day takes 3 hours every 4 days and I just can't do it anymore. Swimming, rain, humidity, etc, it all makes me so scared to just experience life without 24/7 worrying about my hair.\n\nI want to get it straightened, so that even after I wash it, it will come out straight, or like SLIGHTLY wavy is fine, like 1c,2a. **I got a keratin smoothing** done this year, they told me it would not straighten, just defrizz. They said it'd last up to 6 months. I got it done at a salon, and they said to leave it in for 2-3 days before washing, but the longer the better, i left it in for 7 days and then washed. My **hair reverted to curly as usual**, I can't tell if it was less frizzy or not, but wtv. About 2 months later, I had **SO SO MUCH shedding**, idk if it was related to the keratin treatment or not. I did feel a little bit of scalp burning during the treatment. SO MUCH SHEDDING. I was so so worried. The shedding lasted about 4 washes, or a month, and then went away I think.\n\nAnyway, now, I really want straightening done, not smoothing or defrizzing, actually straight. **It needs to be straight after washing too**. BUT, I am worried about damage, specifically shedding/hair loss, **idc if it causes split ends, but I CANNOT have hair loss or too much breakage** again. **I've looked into magic sleek, proaddiction, pura luxe, keratin?, brazillian, etc.** \n\n**Please SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE with the treatments, and if you're a stylist, give recommendations.**",
