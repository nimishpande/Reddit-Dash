As of right now my routine is wash with NYM  curl talk shampoo, use NYM conditioner afterwards from mid length (like ear level) down to the ends and comb through in the shower. Then once out of the shower I use NYM curl talk mousse, about two golf ball size pumps. At this point my hair is dripping (wondering if this is the issue - too much water weighing it down). Praying hands, scrunch with my hands, then scrunch with a tshirt. I follow that up by pixie diffusing. I dry it 90% with the diffuser then I find it falls a good amount in the rest of the time its drying. The first picture is after diffusing, and my texture will certainly fall more throughout the day. As far as day two hair, I wet my hands and scrunch just to bring back some of the texture that may have been lost while sleeping, but even that texture will fall through the day as well. I am frustrated with my hair :/ is there something I am doing wrong?",

      "content": "I’ve been trying to learn more about how to address dull, textured skin, and I’ve come to the conclusion that my skin is likely dehydrated. Because of that, I’ve been focusing on hydrating ingredients and possibly incorporating retinoids. I’ve watched several YouTube dermatologists for guidance. Dr. Daniel Sugai, for example, recommends hyaluronic acid—particularly in serum form—as a key hydrating ingredient.\n\nHowever, after watching another dermatologist, Dr. Shereene Idris, I became confused. She argues that low–molecular weight hyaluronic acid can actually be pro-inflammatory and may contribute to dehydration rather than improving it. After checking the ingredient lists of my own skincare products, I realized that almost all of them contain hyaluronic acid in some form.\n\nThis made me wonder why hyaluronic acid is such a ubiquitous ingredient in skincare if it can potentially be irritating or counterproductive for some people. Is it actually damaging, or does it depend on formulation and skin type? And if hyaluronic acid isn’t ideal for dehydrated or sensitive skin, what alternative humectants or hydrating ingredients should I look for instead?",

Helped immensely my minor stress induced hairloss.\n\nFast forward to january i had  noticable hairloss ( i have long hair) nothing insane but diffuse thinning so noticable. Hopped on fin + min + keto spray, helped immensely - still noticably thinning diffusely when wet but when dry couldn't tell unless you were taller than me and looking closely, max results happened 6-8 months after starting\n\nDecided to hop on 5mg minoxidil and oral 1mg fin as I am on TRT so figured might as well max out. Had an insane shed, hopped on keto 2% shampoo twice a week, MSM, and dermastamping .8mm on head biweekly and .6mm on scalp. My hair grew very fast however the diffuse thinning got really really noticable and my hairline / back of head got worse which had never happened i always had a great hairline. I recently got a haircut shorter just to compare and omg my diffuse thinning is so much worse, it dries and thickens enough but i'm still obviously thinning if yoi look. I'm really distraught, bc at this rate I'll be fully bald within a year. I was planning on hopping on dut  but I'm aftaid of that shedding it to the point of no return; right now I don't need a buzzcut but anybody looking at my hair from the top can tell.\n\nIs this a good sign?? Is it normal for increasing minoxidil dose to basically put you worse than when you started, even after recovering immensely? I'm worried my hairloss is just becoming insanely progrssed and im blinded by minox \"shed\".\nAny advice is appreciated.",

      "content": "So, I looked around and read some previous posts about people deciding whether or not to use hair products that are expired, and unsurprisingly, it’s a mixed bag.\n\nSome people say the expiration dates have to do with the bottle (plastic) itself, the preservatives in the product, or possibly scents/texture/efficacy/etc.\n\nAll of that being said, times are hard and there’s a deal on eBay of a small bulk supply of my go-to shampoo and conditioner that equates to getting about 3.5 out of 6 boxes (1 shampoo/1 conditioner per box) basically for free, given current pricing. With the caveat that they “might be a little out of date”\n\nIn the photos, there’s an F: 09/2020 and V: 09/2023. assuming possibly the V is the expiration date or sell by date? (The company has products in Spanish if that helps clarify this for anyone)\n\nRegardless, everything is new/still in box. No idea how or where it was stored. Is it worth it? It’s basically a year+ supply, which obviously pushes it even further past whatever expiration date, since it would be used spread out/as needed.\n\nTLDR: is a year supply of unopened but expired shampoo and conditioner worth buying?\n\n\\-\n\nNot sure if it matters, but for context, the shampoo and conditioner are specifically for post-keratin straightened hair.\n\nI use the same brand for at-home keratin treatments and have found their shampoo and conditioner to work better than basic “sulfate free” and keratin options. And it takes so much energy and time to do the treatment, iykyk, that it sucks when something messes up the results. So, stuck to them for now. open to suggestions, but obviously that’s not the main point of this post.",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I’m looking by for some recommendations on skincare and hair products as the title says haha. I usually just use products I can buy cheap and in bulk, so I’m not the most knowledgeable about this stuff.\n\nFor skin care, I’ve been using neutrogena  scrub and cerebral moisturizer most recently. I use it in the mornings and that’s it. I feel like my skin can be very sensitive and break out in response to things easily (especially certain animal coats and that’s going to be surrounding me in my career and some will make me break out in a rash on my face, hands, arms, neck, basically anywhere the animal touches me and that sometimes also happens if they’re outside a lot because I have a lot of pollen allergens as well). I don’t wear makeup a lot, right now for events and that’s it and that’s not frequent. I don’t start with putting foundation on more frequently but I’m just too lazy with my clinical schedule while finishing school\n\nAs for hair care, I’ve been using Aussie multi miracle shampoo and conditioner. My hair is extremely straight, I done dye it (sometimes I think about highlights but don’t act on it haha). I shower at night. Wash and condition it daily (sometimes I’m lazy and skip conditioner). It gets horribly greasy if I don’t  wash it every day. It’s just overall as flat as possible and holds no volume.\n\nSo honestly any recommendations for products or routines would be fantastic. Thanks in advance!!!",
