As of right now my routine is wash with NYM  curl talk shampoo, use NYM conditioner afterwards from mid length (like ear level) down to the ends and comb through in the shower. Then once out of the shower I use NYM curl talk mousse, about two golf ball size pumps. At this point my hair is dripping (wondering if this is the issue - too much water weighing it down). Praying hands, scrunch with my hands, then scrunch with a tshirt. I follow that up by pixie diffusing. I dry it 90% with the diffuser then I find it falls a good amount in the rest of the time its drying. The first picture is after diffusing, and my texture will certainly fall more throughout the day. As far as day two hair, I wet my hands and scrunch just to bring back some of the texture that may have been lost while sleeping, but even that texture will fall through the day as well. I am frustrated with my hair :/ is there something I am doing wrong?",

Basically no one knows how to take care of it and I think my hair could look a lot better if I knew how to. \n\nMy current routine consists of Hairitage shampoo applied thoroughly and then rinsed, followed by Hask argan oil conditioner and combing it all the way through my hair, letting it sit for 2-3 minutes and then rinsing. I scrunch it while towel drying but leave it alone to air dry after that and don’t do anything else to it. I don’t add curl cream or any leave in conditioners because I hate the feeling of stuff being left in my hair. My hair also gets greasy really quickly so I don’t know if that’s a problem with the products I’m using or what, it might be the conditioner or just my pillows. Any tips are welcome, my hair might also be damaged from bleaching it but that was a few months ago as you can see from the grow out at my roots. ",

It started about two years ago and has progressively gotten worse.\nI know I’m at an age where hormones can shift, so I suspect it may be hormonal acne (though I’m not 100% sure). I’ve been taking a hormone balance supplement, but I haven’t seen much improvement. This has honestly been really hard on my confidence, I haven’t felt this insecure about my skin since middle school, and it’s painful to look in the mirror.\nMy acne is mostly on my cheeks. I also have blackheads on my nose, but my main concern is the acne and the hyperpigmentation left behind after breakouts. I feel like I’ve tried everything, but nothing fully clears it. \nCurrent simple routine: \nAM: Rinse with water, moisturizer, sunscreen\nPM: wash with youth to the people superfood cleanser, apply azelaic acid, moisturizer. I have combination skin. I’ve included some photos of the products I’m currently using for reference.\nI’ve also tried toners like Paula’s Choice exfoliating toner and Byoma Hydrating Milk Toner, but neither seemed to help, so I just keep my routine simple now to avoid using any products that may break my skin out further. \nAs for my lifestyle, I eat fairly healthy, stay hydrated, and only drink alcohol on occasion. I do vape sometimes, which I suspect may be affecting my skin barrier. \nI would really appreciate any insight on whether I should make any routine adjustments or ingredient changes. I have seen a dermatologist in the past, but she prescribed me winlevi, which broke my skin out horribly, and I haven’t returned since. I do plan on scheduling an appointment soon though. Thank you for reading!! \n\n\n",

I’ve had a butterfly cut the last few times, but I don’t think I want to get another (my last hair dresser talked me into it because he said it would look great on me). \n\nI have a chronic illness that makes styling my hair extremely difficult. Realistically, I just put my hair in a low ponytail and call it a day. I wanna be able to wear my hair down occasionally with little to no styling (I usually put an anti frizz in and maybe some curl cream or mousse if I’m gonna wear it down, but that’s it). \n\nI’m thinking of getting it cut to just below my shoulders/collarbone and internal layers. Is this a good idea? Does anyone else have a better suggestion? I’m open to doing pretty much anything as long as I can still tie my hair back and it’s light and manageable. ",

I have to say this product is kinda decent, especially for oily acne-prone skin like me. I heard someone said it might ball up after layering makeup, but I normally just use a hydrating serum, moisturizer and sunscreen, so it works for me. The reason I bought this is because I want to address my redness and hyperpigmentation, and it indeed removed my hyperpigmentation but it really takes time. Lots of TikTok videos show that the hyperpigmentation would just be gone within a week, and I have to say, it’s not that magical. Aside from that, the texture likes a silky gel, which I like.\n",
