As of right now my routine is wash with NYM  curl talk shampoo, use NYM conditioner afterwards from mid length (like ear level) down to the ends and comb through in the shower. Then once out of the shower I use NYM curl talk mousse, about two golf ball size pumps. At this point my hair is dripping (wondering if this is the issue - too much water weighing it down). Praying hands, scrunch with my hands, then scrunch with a tshirt. I follow that up by pixie diffusing. I dry it 90% with the diffuser then I find it falls a good amount in the rest of the time its drying. The first picture is after diffusing, and my texture will certainly fall more throughout the day. As far as day two hair, I wet my hands and scrunch just to bring back some of the texture that may have been lost while sleeping, but even that texture will fall through the day as well. I am frustrated with my hair :/ is there something I am doing wrong?",

      "content": "For some context, I had been on oral minoxidil since around  last year with topical maybe beginning of last year. Helped immensely my minor stress induced hairloss.\n\nFast forward to january i had  noticable hairloss ( i have long hair) nothing insane but diffuse thinning so noticable. Hopped on fin + min + keto spray, helped immensely - still noticably thinning diffusely when wet but when dry couldn't tell unless you were taller than me and looking closely, max results happened 6-8 months after starting\n\nDecided to hop on 5mg minoxidil and oral 1mg fin as I am on TRT so figured might as well max out. Had an insane shed, hopped on keto 2% shampoo twice a week, MSM, and dermastamping .8mm on head biweekly and .6mm on scalp. My hair grew very fast however the diffuse thinning got really really noticable and my hairline / back of head got worse which had never happened i always had a great hairline. I recently got a haircut shorter just to compare and omg my diffuse thinning is so much worse, it dries and thickens enough but i'm still obviously thinning if yoi look. I'm really distraught, bc at this rate I'll be fully bald within a year. I was planning on hopping on dut  but I'm aftaid of that shedding it to the point of no return; right now I don't need a buzzcut but anybody looking at my hair from the top can tell.\n\nIs this a good sign?? Is it normal for increasing minoxidil dose to basically put you worse than when you started, even after recovering immensely? I'm worried my hairloss is just becoming insanely progrssed and im blinded by minox \"shed\".\nAny advice is appreciated.",

Threw up multiple times and started freaking out. So she just stopped doing it infront of them.\n\nHowever, I have 3 lizards in my room. Which, I might be incorrect, but the smell of acetone hurts reptiles way more than cats. Additionally, I hate the smell of acetone.\n\nI’m curious to know, if any of you own pets and do nails (bonus points if you hate the smell of acetone), what helps you?\n\nBeing in another room? Keeping them out of the room? Using a fan? Using an air freshener? Opening a window? Or should I just wait until I move out to start it as a hobby?\n\nAny advice helps! ❤️",

However, I'm not sure this one is the best option? It sounds great EXCEPT for those cooling pads, which I don't think will do much for me since my under eyes are hollow (tear throughs) and not puffy (my eyelids are though ..sigh). I also really want the light around my eyes, since my skin there is very crepe-y which maybe the light can help with? And this mask blocks that light?\n\nBut in my country the only other mask option (without ordering from other countries with expensive shipping) is the current body version one, which from what I understand only has one program?\n\nWould I maybe be better off keeping the shark and just getting one of those small wands or something for around my eyes? (Does anyone have a recommendation there?)\n\nSorry for the wall of text, I just get really stressed about getting the best possible product when its such expensive items, but I also really want to start using it! 😅",
