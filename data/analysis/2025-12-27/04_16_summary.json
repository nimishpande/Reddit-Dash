If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

As of right now my routine is wash with NYM  curl talk shampoo, use NYM conditioner afterwards from mid length (like ear level) down to the ends and comb through in the shower. Then once out of the shower I use NYM curl talk mousse, about two golf ball size pumps. At this point my hair is dripping (wondering if this is the issue - too much water weighing it down). Praying hands, scrunch with my hands, then scrunch with a tshirt. I follow that up by pixie diffusing. I dry it 90% with the diffuser then I find it falls a good amount in the rest of the time its drying. The first picture is after diffusing, and my texture will certainly fall more throughout the day. As far as day two hair, I wet my hands and scrunch just to bring back some of the texture that may have been lost while sleeping, but even that texture will fall through the day as well. I am frustrated with my hair :/ is there something I am doing wrong?",

      "content": "I’ve been trying to learn more about how to address dull, textured skin, and I’ve come to the conclusion that my skin is likely dehydrated. Because of that, I’ve been focusing on hydrating ingredients and possibly incorporating retinoids. I’ve watched several YouTube dermatologists for guidance. Dr. Daniel Sugai, for example, recommends hyaluronic acid—particularly in serum form—as a key hydrating ingredient.\n\nHowever, after watching another dermatologist, Dr. Shereene Idris, I became confused. She argues that low–molecular weight hyaluronic acid can actually be pro-inflammatory and may contribute to dehydration rather than improving it. After checking the ingredient lists of my own skincare products, I realized that almost all of them contain hyaluronic acid in some form.\n\nThis made me wonder why hyaluronic acid is such a ubiquitous ingredient in skincare if it can potentially be irritating or counterproductive for some people. Is it actually damaging, or does it depend on formulation and skin type? And if hyaluronic acid isn’t ideal for dehydrated or sensitive skin, what alternative humectants or hydrating ingredients should I look for instead?",
