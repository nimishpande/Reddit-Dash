I like having short hair. And it does feel a lot healthier and thicker. All I can hope is that in a month or two it will grow out nicer. \n\nBut this is way too short. I showed my hair dresser the photos OF ME with my short bob and the choppy layers, and specifically told her i wanted to avoid my hair looking like a big ball. She seemed like she really understood and was even saying comments about how we are gonna bring out my curl, avoid flatness, add plenty of choppy layers… but i feel like it came out like a big shapeless ball anyway. It wont curl at all like how it did. Its shorter than I ever wanted. I feel like its an old lady haircut and i know its dramatic but i’ve been crying nonstop. This has completely tanked my self esteem and self image. I can’t even recognize myself, and itll take MONTHS to get to where I’m happy with it. I’m so so devastated that it isnt curling like it did before. I feel so sick and upset and like i cant even go outside. ",

I’m also autistic so I think I just have trouble knowing things others people seem to just naturally know how to do. \n\nI’ve always just washed it and then brushed it wet and then carried on with my day. I do wash my hair every day, I can’t get away without it and yes I’ve tried the training but it just doesn’t work for me. I also used to be made fun of for looking “greasy” as a child so I have a little paranoia and discomfort around that which makes it hard to skip a hair wash even if I didn’t feel very dirty. \n\nI have never really cared about my appearance but I’ve lost 120+ lbs (397 to the 270s) I actually feel pretty good about myself and want to feel like I look pretty too. \n\nI can’t seem to get the hang of hair care, I’ve tried a few different shampoo and conditioners, from redken to rice water to olaplex and even the dove stuff everyone swears by even though it’s cheap. I’ve tried using oil (sparingly), leave in conditioners, and air dry creams. I use a weekly clarifying shampoo and an argan hair mask. I sleep on a silk pillowcase, my hair brush is a wet brush. I don’t like the feeling of brushing my hair while it’s dry. \n\nI’ve tried blow drying and straightening or air drying but I always have this little fluffy frizzy look going on that I feel makes me look messy and it makes my hair look dry? I don’t know how when I use hydration shampoo, \n\nIf I put it up I get a million threads of hair falling out and looking like I just missed grabbing them with the hair tie. I’m about to ask if they will just shave off the baby hairs at the nape of my neck next time I get my hair cut because I can’t get them to behave. \n\nAny advice to get rid of the frizzy stuff? I am starting to feel like I’m just not meant to have nice hair. It’s discouraging to know no matter how much weight I lose I’ll still be ugly lol. ",

Return both? (not the ideal solution as I’m not a fan of returning gifts - but one is from hubby and he’ll be happy to adapt) Also I feel like my hair takes a really long time to dry. Is that because of my hair type or is it because of the dryer?

I also have in the past had them tinted darker, more ashy but dark brown is not a good idea for me either.\n\nI currently tint the transparent hairs with just for men beard dye in blonde (which isn’t mean to be warm) and use fenty light blonde brow pencil (love how light it is but too yellow).\n\nWould appreciate hearing ideas - I’ve heard there are Asian brow gels that lighten? Or maybe there’s another lightening product?\n\nThanks everyone 🙏",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Not sure if this is a reliable indicator of my actual hair porosity.\nThe area I live in has what is considered very soft water so i have not worried about it affecting my hair.\n\nI have tried no shampoo routines and curly friendly routines but my hair just always seems to look like the picture below. Lots of frizz and no definition.\n\nI have not used any heat or chemical treatments on my hair but i have started noticing that some parts of my hair that used to be tight ringlets have gone completely straight and limp (cant see it in the photo, thet are hiding at the bottom) and this has gotten me worried that the rest of my hair is set to follow.\n\nAny suggestions on how to fix my frizz and strange straight limp strands will be appreciated!\n\n",

I’m 70% happy with how that’s controlled my skin’s congestion and sensitivity but I want better ROI for the time/money/consistency I’m putting in. I plan to skin cycle exfoliation/tret/break and look forward to seeing how it goes.\n\nHere’s where it gets complicated - they also prescribed clindamycin? And I feel like the reviews and information I’m getting about clinda are so mixed. I’m hesitant to try it at all after the horror stories I’ve read about acne coming back with a vengeance. I COULD use it as a short term bridge through any tret purging but I’m not sure where to add it into my routine - especially since concurrent BP use is recommended and that seems like a lot. Should I even bother? Has anyone actually had a great experience with it (including coming off, because the nurse in me is very opposed to using an antibiotic indefinitely).\n\nAny advice and experience is appreciated!!",

      "title": "[ROUTINE HELP] Expanding from just a nighttime wash + lotion",
      "content": "I've read countless threads about skincare and my head is *spinning*. I've only ever had face wash and moisturizer, so trying to sort between toners, exfoliators, sunscreens, serums, gels, retinols, BHA, AHA, azelaic acid, tret, spearmint, etc etc etc is overwhelming.\n\n**Skin background:** 26 years old and I believe I have hormonal acne since it exclusively flares on my chin/jawline, and especially when I'm near my period. My skin is somewhat sensitive but rather moderate in terms of oiliness and dryness, but I'd lean toward dryness if anything. I'm prone to very mild eczema on my hands that is easily controlled with moisturizer, if that matters. My acne isn't over the top, just a few pimples at a time and the occasional cystic acne spot, but it's *all* the time. It's admittedly made worse by a mild skin picking habit that I'm working on and have greatly improved on. I just feel like my skin holds onto everything and it takes pimples/spots a very long time to go away, so I'm frustrated by feeling like I can never have a clear face.\n\n**My current routine:** Before bed, I remove my makeup with reusable cloth pads that work with water and wash using the CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser, then Cetaphil moisturizing lotion after. I also use lotion in the morning and mix a small amount of my foundation into it. I also have hypochlorous acid spray that I was using morning and night pretty consistently but fell off, I'm now getting back into that habit and I do think it helps.\n\n**What I think I should do:** Based on my research, I assume that feeling like my skin \"holds onto\" everything is due to a lack of exfoliation, so I want to try that. I am eyeing Paula's Choice [6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant](https://www.paulaschoice.com/skin-perfecting-6pct-mandelic-acid-and-2pct-lactic-acid-liquid-exfoliant/1470-1477.html) or the [1% BHA Sensitive Skin Exfoliant](https://www.paulaschoice.com/calm-1pct-bha-sensitive-skin-exfoliant/921A-9217.html). I also know adding sunscreen should be at the top of my list, but I haven't narrowed my choices for that yet.\n\nOtherwise, I am working on increasing water intake, I'm already dairy free, I exercise 4+ times per week and am generally low-stress.\n\nPlease let me know if I left any important information out, but I'm hoping to get some advice on what I should add/change about my routine. I know this is a mid routine compared to what a lot of y'all got going on, but if there are 1-2 products that anyone can recommend, I am all ears and appreciate your time :)\n\nEdit to add: I did read the suggested SCA Routine and since I already have that, minus sunscreen, I am looking for next steps specific to the situation I described",

      "content": "hi guys! I have been on a wavy hair journey for some years now and on and off I will try new products in hopes of defining my waves and taming my frizz without weighing my hair down. here is my daily routine currently:\n\n1. wash hair with Paul Mitchell Clean Beauty Anti-Frizz Shampoo, condition with Paul Mitchell Clean Beauty Hydrating Conditioner (I have found these products make my hair very soft without build up or residual residue) I also brush my hair in the shower while the conditioner is in my hair.\n2. post shower with hair very wet, I have just purchased and am trying out Oribe Curl Gloss. I add a quarter size amount and smooth through my hair then do the scrunch method for 5-10 minutes.\n3. when my hair is absolutely dried I apply Kerastase hair oil.\n\nthat is my whole routine. I find that with low porosity hair the less products the better because even though my hair is dry and frizzy it gets weighed down easily.\n\nthe one issue I’m trying to figure out is how to maintain my waves the next day after sleeping on it. I sleep on a satin pillow case. my hair creases easily so I don’t put my hair up in a pony tail or bun or else the next day my hair looks dented. I have read that some people next day “rewet” their hair with a spray bottle and rescrunch to activate the product from the day prior but I find adding water and scrunching makes my hair frizzy. am I doing something wrong?\n\nI just want luscious, defined, and soft curls. I don’t care if I have to spend money on high quality products to achieve this either. any product or routine recommendations? I also used to shower at night but I have no switched to morning in hopes of my hair drying more “nicely“ while my styling products are in.\n\nhere is a video of my post shower routine. ignore the Kerastase night serum I have got rid of that because I think applying it on top of my Oribe curl gloss was weighing my waves down. also shown is my hair dried with just the Oribe curl gloss and Kerastase hair oil. my hair still looks a bit dry to me. what else can I do?!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1beki0p0yr9g1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8104cf85a8e4204648e3b854e15df7f73abf275\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mi6rm4p0yr9g1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29547b4294d8700436deba6eb2c34bce28907d54\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lttvo0p0yr9g1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf2e0599e9dbb9fb8234d9778d88958f4e8d1c8a\n\nedit: I guess the video cannot be uploaded :/",

On non-tret nights, I was also using Aziderm (azelaic acid 10%).\nInitially, I expected purging and mild irritation, but over time I started noticing persistent facial redness, which now feels “stuck”.\nFor the past 6 days, I have completely stopped tretinoin and all actives, and I’m only following a very basic routine:\nCurrent routine (last 6 days):\nSimple Gentle Face Wash\nCerave Moisturizer or Minimalist 0.3% Ceramide Moisturizer\nSunscreen every day (Neutrogena or Re’equil)\n\nEven after stopping all actives, the redness is still present, and my skin looks noticeably red compared to how it looked before starting tret. I’ve attached before-tret vs current photos for reference.\nSome background:\nOily, acne-prone skin\nUsed tret consistently but not aggressively\nAlways moisturized and used sunscreen\nNo exfoliating acids, scrubs, or harsh cleansers\nAzelaic acid was used only on non-tret nights\n\nMy questions:\n1)Did I over-stress or damage my skin barrier, especially by combining tret and azelaic acid?\n2)Can long-term tret use (5 months) still cause redness like this, even after stopping?\n 3)Is  this more likely irritation, inflammation, or early rosacea-like reaction?\n4)What’s the best way to calm this redness and return to my pre-tret skin condition?\n5)Should tretinoin be reintroduced later, or is it better to stop completely?",

Copious amounts of gel won’t define that section. I still have to use a lot of gel on the rest of my hair to get ok definition. Was wondering what I could do (like hair treatment or mask) to fix this frizziness. I don’t have a consistent routine. I’m kind of bouncing around products to see what will work or fix the frizz. In the first photo, I have only mousse in my hair- my hair is more curled around the perimeter of my head. In the other three, my hair has a leave in and gel. ",

      "content": "Hi all, I wanted to come on and share my skincare routine and get some feedback to see what I may be doing wrong/what I can improve :) \n\nI’ve been doing this routine consistently (every night no skips) for around 3-4 months now. \n\nI am 25 female in the UK, I eat fairly well (fruit and veg every day, I tend to stay away from most refined sugars/processed foods and white carbs - I eat mainly meat, healthy carbs like rice, lentils and sweet potato, plenty of fruit and veg, eggs and oily fish). I drink plenty of room temp water every day (usually 1.5-2 litres). I don’t really drink fizzy drinks (occasionally a Diet Coke or a Guinness once a week at most) \n\nMy skin is quite oily around my forehead, nose and chin. I get the occasional spot but never full blown acne or more than one spot. I get bumps and blemishes (pictured in comments!). My skin is quite textured on my nose and forehead and chin also. Kinda like teeny little bumps, it’s worst under my bottom lip/on my upper chin which I’ve attached a photo in the comments \n\nAt night I take supplements which are magnesium citrate, vitamin C and zinc, omega 3 oil, and iron. Every morning I take vitamin D and B12. \n\nI have a super bad habit of always touching my face so I’m guessing that needs to stop lol\n\nMy skin routine is as follows (which all takes place in the evening, in the shower):\n\n1. Remove makeup and wash face with this: \n\nSimple Kind to Skin Refreshing Shower Gel - https://www.simple.co.uk/p/kind-to-skin-refreshing-shower-gel.html/08720181336195\n\n2. Double cleanse my face with this, which I usually rub really well particularly in to my forehead, nose and chin: CeraVe SA Smoothing Cleanser - https://www.cerave.co.uk/skincare/cleansers/sa-smoothing-cleanser\n\n3. Pat skin dry with towel but still damp, and rub 2-3 drops of this all over my face and down my neck - The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid Serum https://theordinary.com/en-gb/hyaluronic-acid-2-b5-serum-with-ceramides-100637.html\n\n4. Two pumps of this and rub into my skin all over and down my neck - Boots Collagen Booster https://www.boots.com/boots-ingredients-collagen-booster-30ml-10321557?traffic=paid.shopping&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad\\_source=1&amp;gad\\_campaignid=21096115648&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-AdmwQioxZONcKRqldsHl9YSGZmj&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiApL7KBhC7ARIsAD2Xq3CwtipKJicE2QH4zGuVOdvy5tifBHudXFemNs6fCOPIpa4jVHz5GiMaAuiGEALw\\_wcB\n\n5. Pea sized amount of this and rub into my skin all over and down my neck - Boots Azelaic Acid Gel Cream https://www.boots.com/boots-ingredients-azelaic-acid-gel-cream-30ml-10320619\n\n6. Pea sized amount of this and rubbed into my skin all over and down my neck - Nivea Soft Cream https://www.nivea.co.uk/products/soft-moisturiser-face-body-and-hands-40058085155540045.html\n\nIn the morning I just use a Simple brand makeup wipe to clean my face before I start my makeup - here: https://www.simple.co.uk/p/kind-to-skin-cleansing-facial-wipes.html/05011451103979\n\nAny feedback appreciated :) thanks!

More of a self care thing than a routine if that makes sense! I’m just having a hard time finding anything without actives in it, as I’m afraid of overwhelming my skin.\n\nIf it helps, here’s my previous and current skincare lineup!\n\nPrevious:\n\nLa Roche Posay purifying face wash (M+N)\n\nBenzoyl peroxide 10% (N)\n\nWeleda skin food light version (M+N)\n\nSupergoop unseen sunscreen (M)\n\n\nCurrent:\n\nCerave hydrating cleanser (M+N)\n\nTretinoin .025% (N) 2x per week\n\nWeleda skin food heavy version (M+N)\n\nSupergoop unseen sunscreen (M)\n\n\nAny recs or thoughts very welcome !! \n\nEdit: formatting and clarity on tret routine!\n",
