      "title": "Curls are starting to go straight even with product / No consistency (UK)",
      "content": "Hair type: Low density, Course, High porosity 2c/3a (I think)\n\n\nHi, so I started growing my hair during Covid and by Oct 21 it was shoulder length (pic 1), and it looked pretty good considering I did nothing with it except wash (Aussie Miracle Moist) and condition (Tresemme rich moisture), then air dry.  I have satin pillowcase and a silk bonnet that I wear to bed.  I also turned 50 in October 25, and my hair has definitely got thinner in the last 5 years.\n\n\nAt some point in early 22 I had my hair done to make it lighter halfway down and the following year (2023 - pic2) I discovered Flora &amp; Curl curl lotion - I would use a blob of that after washing (hair still wet) and comb it through root to tip with a curly hair comb, then let it air dry which worked great for a while (pics 3-5).  Unfortunately at some point mid-late 2024/early 2025 F&amp;C changed the lotion in some way and it changed consistency.  After that it felt greasy and heavy, although it did still help a bit with the curl (pic 6).\n\n\nAfter that I noticed that intermittently my hair would go straight halfway down the strand, and be super frizzy and or lose definition (pics 7 &amp; 8).  After that point if I washed it and didn't use anything except shampoo &amp; conditioner + air dry it turned into a horrible frizzy mess (pic 9).\n\n\nI tried Curl Smith, Curl Show, Camille Rose, Only Curls, Cantu and some others but they all did the same thing as the single F&amp;C lotion after it changed, and some of them were really heavy.\n\n\nIn mid December (25) I had my hair coloured (just a dark red, no bleach) and just after I went and picked up the 3 stage F&amp;C line (lotion, gel and mousse) to see if those together would do anything.  For my work Xmas party I washed it the night before, and then used the F&amp;C lotion, then mousse, and then used my hands to remove excess water and then scrunched my hair for the first time ever, and did that for about 30 mins.  I then used a hairdryer on low blowing up at me to try with my head upside down to try and remove some moisture and add volume.  When it had finished and I took the picture the next day (pic 10) I had the best curls I've seen in years, and a ringlet one I could put a pencil up at the front.\n\n\nWeirdly I've not been able to recreate what I had at Xmas since - Over the holiday period I was told I should be using a defuser, so I brought one (Tresemme Pro Pure Curl Define).  Yesterday I tried using all 3 F&amp;C products + the defuser (watched some vids on how to use it) and it went horribly.  About £50 in product + defuser and to be honest it looks the worst it has in SO long I just want to give up (pic 11).\n\n\nIt looked so good right after I had it coloured and just using the lotion and mousse + hand scrunch, and now I'm wondering if the colouring is doing something to the hair that makes the product work better.  Of course as I'm washing it now no colour runs out so if that was the case that would help explain the texture change.  The last 2 pics don't even look like the same hair!\n\n\nI originally wrote this back in November 25 but with the colour and my lucky Xmas hair I thought I had cracked it, but that turned out to be a one off so here I am, asking for any hints or tips on what to do next.",

I straightened my hair last night to see if I would look better with straight hair, I decided to keep it for yesterday and today to see if I like it or not, the truth is I genuinely feel like I'm prettier with straight/wavy hair and not curly hair. I know curly hair is a blessing but I look like a mess because I dont know how to keep care of it and i don't have the products to do so and my mom won't buy them for me so I'm stuck with floofy outrageous and unkept curls. I got the curls from my dad as you can tell and my mom has beautiful dark wavy hair, something I've always wanted ever since I was a little girl.\n\nPretty much what happened today: I came out my room to do chores this afternoon and my mom spotted my hair and absolutely lost her shit. She explained to me that most girls have to spend a lot of money for curls like mine and that I just wake up with them everyday and that I should feel greatful to have good genetics and that my hair is my personality and who I am.\n\nBut I feel so ugly with them. It doesn't compliment my face shape, my face looks square with my curls while with straightened hair my face looks slim and my face is more graceful.\n\nI need opinions so I've attached what I look like with curls vs straight hair. Thank you!\n",

      "content": "Hello! Another mixed girl with a yt mother who didn’t know or care to learn how to do her hair 👋🏼😐 As of the last 2 years, I haven’t gotten any chemical treatment and it is now almost completely grown out (I’ve also been cutting it off in like 2-3in increments periodically). Now I just have terrible heat damage. I have NO IDEA how to do anything with my hair. I’ve been educating myself in the last couple weeks and bought a whole bunch of products. As of the last week, I stopped using heat on my hair and learning how to manage it day to day with no heat &amp; no slick backs. I’m going to be trying to learn how to braid, too, but that’s gonna take me a minute 🤣\n\nAnyway, right now my routine: I use Camille Rose Curl Love shampoo, conditioner, and leave in. During the day, I’ve been working on learning how to define my curls (that are currently non-existent). I start with a wet head, leave in (Curl Love), comb that in, section hair, curl crème (As I Am), scrunch, gel (Combat Gel watered down a bit), scrunch, then air dry or regular hair dryer. I bought a diffuser but I don’t have it yet At night, I rinse the day products out and put in a mask. I’ve been alternating every other day with Texture ID deep treatment mask and Shea Moisture Intensive Hydration mask.\n\nI am getting a hair cut (not a big chop, but the rest of my processed hair) next week, I wanted to get it professionally cut since I’ve been doing it myself. What else? What other products? Advice? Anything haha. Thank you!\n\n*First pic is dried, styled, scrunched, all that lol. Second pic is wet with leave-in",

Here's the boring routine that actually worked: \n\n1. Face wash: If your face feels squeaky after washing, congrats, you just irritated it. Gentle&gt; deep clean always.\n\n2. One serum. literally one: Not a cocktail. Not skin cycling. Just pick your fighter: \n\ndull--&gt;vitamin C\n\noily/breakouts --&gt; niacinamide\n\ndry/tight --&gt; hydrating serum\n\n3. Moisturiser : yes, even if you have a oily skin. Skipping this made my skin more bad.

Been shaving bald from 2021, lately just wondering is medication works for me or not. \n\nUsing fin 1.25mg and topical min once at night since early oct. But I just found out my early bottle of min is fake, so probably my min treatment is considered started since november. \n\nAlso adding dermastamp once a week since october\n\nSo far pretty satisfied with the result, perhaps another 3-6 months and I'll get rid of my diffuse thinning 🤞\nGo try it if you're still hesitating, you never know if you don't try. Good luck guys\n\n*PS I'm pretty lucky to not have any sides. My scalp is actually healthier since adding the stacks, no more flaky or dry skin\n\nThe second photo is when I use hair fiber, almost seems like no thinning at all in the crown 😂",

The plus side was my skin everywhere else looked so good but my lower eyelid was so inflamed. Lots of burning, swelling and redness around my eye. Oddly this all went away soon as stopped using it. I switched to Dieux air Angel and it leaves my skin very dry and I need something more moisturizing. \n\nVanicream gentle face wash makes my skin look very inflamed after I come out of the shower. Lots of redness on my checks and tiny bumps everywhere. I stopped using this the redness has reduced quite a bit. \n\nI’m using a Clinique face wash which doesn’t leave my skin red but it feels very drying. \n\nI heard about fungal acne recently and was told to use zinc face shampoo on my face and all the tiny bumps have drastically reduced but now my skin just feels dry and a new stye formed on my lower eyelid after using aestura atobarrier 365 serum. \n\nAnyone here dealt with skincare causing styes around the eyes, fungal acne, redness and extreme dryness? Any advice or recommendations on which face wash, makeup remover and moisturizer to purchase when experiencing these issues? \n\nI feel so exhausted ever since I ruined my skin barrier. I was new to acids, used strong blackhead removal tools and was too abrasive when using a physical exfoliant on my face a year ago.  My skin now reacts to so many things and the dryness is now the newest big problem. \n\n",

      "content": "I'm trying to choose a retinoid with the main intent of reducing wrinkles. I'm a male in my mid 30's, and the wrinkles on my forehead have gotten pretty aggressive in the past year or so, as well as around the eyes (same as everyone else).\n\nI used the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle repair in the past for a bit over a year with limited to no side effects, but also no notable benefit. It is possible that I started using it when wrinkles would have began to form and get worse so the net effect balanced out. I'm looking for a retinoid product that will best treat wrinkles and be more aggressive than the Neutrogena product I used. To my knowledge, the retinoid products are retinol, retinal, adapalene (Differin), and prescription rentin-a (Tretinoin). I see conflicting information regarding their effectiveness for reducing wrinkles as the intent of some of them is something else and treating wrinkles is a secondary outcome.\n\nCan anyone provide some clarity if any product treats wrinkles the best? I don't know how I would get a prescription for tretinoin, so the other types of retinoids are probably the better option. Additionally, does anyone have any specific product recommendations? I know many retinoids are susceptible to breakdown and oxidation, so there are likely products that are largely inert. I'm hoping to choose a product from a reputable brand that protects against product breakdown and tests for it.\n\nThe product I was looking at was the Avène Retrinal 0.1 Intensive Multi-Corrective Cream (retinal), but it is expensive and I'm still unsure of how retinal compares to adapalene or tretinoin for the treatment of wrinkles. Thanks in advance for any help.",

The only “sin” I can think of is that I got kind of overweight around the same time I got into skincare and recently lost a lot of weight quickly and plan to lose even more.\n\nI don’t have pictures of me from when I was I leaner pre weight gain and subsequent loss so I’m not sure if i looked like this before or if it’s recentish phenomenon \n\nI also unfortunately sit a lot at my desk on my computer so maybe bad posture causes my skin to droop as well.\n\nIs there anything I can do to fix this that’s not surgical? And is the “skin suck up technique” I’m doing bad long term? Cause I’ve been doing it all the time now.\n\nIf I can’t fix it without a face lift or something what can I do in terms of prevention from it not getting any worse? \n\nThanks",

      "content": "For well over a decade, my routine has been to use this Pantene Extra Strong Hold Gel in my hair, and then Tigi Bedhead Manipulator in the front.  That gel was discontinued a few years ago, and I have literally bought nearly a dozen different gels since then, hoping that one of them would be similar, with nearly zero success.  The only one I've tried that is even remotely close is Aussie's Instant Volume Gel, but it's only 60-70% close and my hair just does not cooperate with it very well.  I've resorted to paying overinflated prices on ebay, but it's even getting hard to find on there.  I even emailed Pantene Customer Service recently, and their recommendation (Pantene Flexible Waves &amp; Curls Gel) was absolutely terrible - very watery, zero Hold.  If anyone used to use this gel and has found something that is very similar in texture and hold, PLEASE let me know.  Here is a list of everything that I've tried and doesn't come even remotely close:\n\n* Aussie Instant Freeze\n* Pantene Flexible Waves &amp; Curls Gel\n* L'Oreal Studio Line Clean Gel\n* L'Oreal Studio Line Mega Gel\n* American Crew Firm Hold Styling Gel\n* Agadir Men Oud Wood Firm Hold Gel\n* Johnny B Fuddy Matte Styling Gel\n* Garnier Pure Clean Extra Strong Styling Gel\n* Aussie Instant Volume Gel\n* Redken Hardwear 16 from like 15 years ago",

      "content": "I (white) have roughly 2c hair prone to frizz that has breakage. I know some of this is mechanical damage from claw clips and the like, but I'm thinking a product or two might help, though I'm pretty minimalist with my routine. I'd say my hair is probably medium thickness and maybe medium density, maybe less dense not sure\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nWash every 4 or so days with Biotera color safe orchid shampoo (my hair isn't currently color-treated but I started using this when it was and kept it).\n\nPantene conditioner in the shower, rinse partly and leave in (bad, I know). Recently I've started rinsing most to all of it out in favor of hair oil. \n\nTwist my hair up in a T-shirt, take down, brush and let it air dry or put it in a bun and go to bed (I know, I know).\n\nWhile brushing wet add Garnier Marvelous oil, also as  needed in between washes. Better and this oil seems to nice and lightweight, but I'm reading that too much hair oil is bad for your hair too. I also just ordered a Denman wet brush that I'm hoping will be better for my hair. \n\nSo I'd like to try a hair mask or leave-in conditioner that will help hydrate my hair, tame frizz and accentuate waves or curls. I'll still probably use the hair oil but I can cut back on it. \n\nI need to avoid anything too heavy for my hair and anything that makes my hands feel gross after handling my hair (why I avoid styling gels and mousse but I'm open to ideas).\n\nIdeally reasonably inexpensive and accessible. \n\nThanks all :) \n\nAny recommendations?
