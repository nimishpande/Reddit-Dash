One serum. literally one: Not a cocktail. Not skin cycling. Just pick your fighter: \n\ndull--&gt;vitamin C\n\noily/breakouts --&gt; niacinamide\n\ndry/tight --&gt; hydrating serum\n\n3. Moisturiser : yes, even if you have a oily skin. Skipping this made my skin more bad.

A good facewash should cleanse without stripping, and honestly that's where gentle, microbiome-friendly formulas make a difference.\n\nWhat I've noticed with pond's hydra miracle facewash is that it cleans well but still feels soft on skin. It lathers nicely, has minimal fragrance (huge win for sensitive skin), and doesn't leave that Squeaky-dry feeling. The whole idea of balancing your skin's microbiome actually matters because when your barrier is happy, your skin stays hydrated longer.\n\nIt also helps that it's not crazily priced, only slightly more than regular facewashes, but nowhere near those expensive \"gentle\" cleansers. With ingredients like Cera Hyamino (hyaluronic acid + ceramides + glycerine), it focuses on hydration while cleansing, which honestly feels like an upgrade for everyday skincare.\n\nIf you've been stuck in the dry-skin-after-washing cycle, this might be the switch your skin has been asking for.\n\nWould love to know, does your face feel tight after cleansing or comfy?",

Typically by end of the week I’m wearing it up as it’s more frizzy/lost definition but I’d like other up-dos than just a low bun. I just have no idea and googling short curly hairstyles isn’t coming up with much for my texture or length. \n\nRoutine:\n-Love beauty planet nourished softness shampoo and conditioner, detangle while conditioner is in\n-While wet from shower, add blueberry curls leave in conditioner and Ouidad climate control heat and humidity gel. Rake products in then scrunch and loosely wrap in microfiber towel\n-Remove towel and let airdry\n-I sleep with it in a loose bun and in a silk bonnet\n-Each morning, I spray with water and add a bit of gel or leave in conditioner to reshape curls a bit   ",

I shower everyday day of course but use a shower cap to keep my hair dry.\n\nMy curls have never been healthier, almost no frizz at all.\n\n\n\nBut because I do feel an itch in my scalp on the seventh day, I wonder if I am hurting my hair long term and should instead switch to twice a week shampooing ? Or is it ok to let your head get a little grimy on the final day. Not sure what is the healthiest approach ?\n\nThe other thing is that now that my hair is shoulder length detangling is taking a long time ! almost 30 minutes because I try to be gentle to avoid breakage. I wonder if my \"no touch\" rule is extreme and if it is ok to detangle everyday. \n\nWhat do you think ? What can I change to optimize? I am satisfied with the visual results though. ",
