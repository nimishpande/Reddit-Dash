      "content": "After 30 days!! Im back again with my reviews. + I USED AZIDERM 15\n\nDifference: Well ignore the huge brown one in the centre that scar is quite recent so i dont expect it to be gone anytime soon. THE SCARS AROUND IT HOWEVER. I have had them for around 2 and 1/2 years after picking on  my folliculities. MY DERMAT DIDNT HELP BTW. And just after 30 days THEY ARE FINALLY FADING OMG IM GONNA CRY. EVEN MY MOM (BIGGEST HATER BTW) SAID THEY BE FADING 😭🙏🙏🙏🤙🤙🤙🤙💌💌💌💌. I wear makeup everyday to hide em marks but well except for hiding that big centre one i got recently others require minimal to no makeup AT ALL. BLESSING OH GOSH 🙏🙏🙏🙏🥀🥀🥀  ANYWAY ONTO THE REVIEW\n\nFIRST OF ALL ID LIKE TO THANK \n\nAZIDERM 15 \n\nI used to use azeliac acid 10% The ordinary. Never really worked much. BUT THIS STUFF CHANGED EVERYTHING. Its very grainy and if you dont pat ur face fully dry before applying IT ITCHES AND STINGS but worth everything. I use it every next night, pea sized amount WHOLE FACE. Dot forget ur Sunscreen!! 8/10 \n\nMOVING ON TO SUNSCREEN\n\nUV DOUX D TAN \n\nWell sorry but it works but does have its own disadvantages. You need to blend it in superhard until all the white stuff disappears and trust me 2 fingers worth of it dont blend in that easily. Its quite moody AND PILLS OCCASIONALLY. Enough blending prevents pilling but if ya dont blend it for 15 full mins 🥰🥰💔💔💔💔 u are cooked. But I do feel like it provides awesome protection. 6/10\n\nMOISTURIZER\n\nHOLY GRAIL. ATODERM IS PEAK IN THESE HARSH WINTERS OH GOD. LOVE LOVE LOVE 10/10 💌💌💌🙏🙏🙏🙏\n\nSERUMS\n\nMINIMALIST NIACINAMIDE,ALPHA ARBUTIN AND RETINOL I think play a pretty huge role too \n Niacidnamide 9/10\nArbutin 8/10 (too foamy)\nRetinol 7/10 (I dont like the base oil)\n\nEYE CREAM\n\nMinimalist Retinal eyecream. Does literally nothing btw. Waste of money 3/10 just for the cooling effect. \n\n\nTHATS IT YALL BYE BYE 🔥🔥🔥🤙🤙🤙🐎🐎💦💦💦💦",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "I’m very new to skincare, and I don’t know much about the different products. But after a horribly stressful year, I have fine lines that I’ve *never* seen before. I was hoping I could tackle it myself with the advice of some friends, who said adding in a retinol would help. But in doing even an ounce of research, I think I’m in over my head when it comes to mixing and matching products. \n\nSo, my two questions are: (1) should I add a retinol to my current routine? If not, what should I add? (2) Are there any other changes you’d recommend? \n\nI’m currently using the Neutrogena hyaluronic acid serum and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer (salicylic acid 0.5%) every morning or immediately after I shower. I only wash my face every couple of days when I shower with the Neutrogena oil-free acne wash (salicylic acid 2%). I’m not passionately attached to Neutrogena; it’s just what my mom bought me most often when I was a teenager. I’ve never had an issue switching things up if she brought home something different. \n\nThe combo is okay, but I don’t see much of a difference using the acid + moisturizer vs just the moisturizer. I think it might be the brand of hyaluronic acid because I was in love with the Quench hyaluronic acid serum from Ever. (It was a magical thing when coupled with the Hawaiian Tropic aloe after-sun lotion when I got really sunburnt. I was glowing.)\n\nOne of my biggest issues with skincare is that I hate the feeling of lotion more than the average person. If the product feels like it’s still moist or oily after a couple of minutes, I won’t use it. It makes me want to crawl out of my skin. Sunscreen and I are mortal enemies for this exact reason. (I still use it when I’m at the pool/beach, but I’m not happy about it.) With this in mind, it’s even harder for me to know what products I’d like **and** will accomplish my goals. I’d love any and all guidance! \n\n",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

He was always hesitant about finasteride, but in August 2024, when I was 23, he finally prescribed finasteride 1 mg every other day after I pushed for it.\n\nI'm now 25 (turning 26 later this year).\n\nMy routine over the past year:\n\n\\-Finasteride 1 mg EOD (I tried daily for \\\\\\~3 months on my own and saw better stabilization)\n\n\\-Minoxidil 5% foam\n\n\\-Minoxidil 5% spray infused with dutasteride\n\n\\-Dermarolling once a week\n\n\\-Blood work twice a year (all normal)\n\nI'm still losing hair, but at a much slower rate, and things felt more stable overall.\n\nAt my last visit (1 week ago), he suddenly told me: -Stop all minoxidil\n\n\\-Stop dermarolling\n\n\\-Reduce finasteride from EOD to twice a week\n\n\\-Switch to a foam called GrowPlex / VitaFoam (minoxidil + “natural DHT blockers”)\n\nHe also said he “doesn’t usually prescribe finasteride for guys my age,” which confused me since I’ve already been on it for over a year. He even said something like “let’s see how long your hair lasts”, which is exactly what I’m trying to avoid.\n\nMy goal has always been to preserve what I have, not let it thin out and then rely on a transplant later. I’ve already tried PRP and even dutasteride mesotherapy in the past.\n\nThis sudden switch feels like a downgrade from proven treatments to something much weaker.\n\nI’ve booked a second opinion, but wanted to ask here:\n\n\\-Does reducing finasteride to twice a week make sense?\n\n\\-Do “natural DHT blockers” in foams actually do anything?\n\n\\-Has anyone had a doctor suddenly pull them off fin/min after long term use?\n\nAny insight would really help.",

      "content": "Hey,\n\nI have been dealing with acne for 8 years now. I was on accutane for 3 years and then stopped. My acne returned after about 8 months. I then just decided to live with it for some time until it bothered me enough to go to the derm again. This was 10 months ago. My derm prescribed me adapalene 0.1 which I took for 4 months. Because my acne didn’t resolve completely, my derm switched me to erythromycin + 0.025 tretinoin. I applied this for another 5 months. Because it didn’t work fully either, my derm switched me to tretinoin 0.05 with no antibiotics. I have been using it for about 5 weeks now.\n\nMy current routine is:\n\nAM:\n\n\\- shaving (with DE razor, with the grain only)\n\n\\- cleanser\n\n\\- azelaic acid 15%\n\n\\- moisturizer\n\nPM:\n\n\\- cleanser\n\n\\- tretinoin 0.05\n\n\\- moisturizer\n\nMy problem is that I still get breakouts. Mostly around the jawline but some also on my cheeks where I shave. My guess is that the azelaic acid irritates my skin after I shaved which causes the pimples as they only appear in areas I shave. Could this be the issue or do you have any other suggestions? Just to clarify, my skin stings a little when I apply the azelaic acid in the areas I shaved. It doesn’t seem to be irritated by the tret as I get no redness or peeling.\n\nThanks for your help!",

Sebomoist – moisturizer \n\n2. Benzoyl peroxide gel – He told me to apply it daily in the morning on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer \n\n3. Clindamycin + Nicotinamide gel – To apply in the afternoon for 1 hour and then wash my face \n\n4. Tretinoin gel 0.025% – He told me to apply it in the evening for ½ hour on the affected areas on alternate days, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer \n\n5. He also prescribed some tablets \n\nI asked him which moisturizer I should use, so he wrote one himself. I also asked him about sunscreen, and he said there was no need since there would already be a lot going on on my face, and suggested that I just cover my face if I go out. I told him I have to attend a wedding, and he then said it was fine to use sunscreen, but he didn’t suggest any specific one.\n\nI currently use Neutrogena sunscreen. Should I continue with that?\nAlso, which face wash should I use with this routine?",

I live in a northern climate and wash about every other day with a good conditioning. I need to use dry shampoo the night after a wash to even make it two days. It's sometimes wavy to slightly curly in the summer. Recently, I spent a week down south and my hair became curly in the humidity. It was fun to try work with. Back to the northern climate, and I'm a dry, mostly flat mess. It's shorter than this photo now, since I can't grow length well with the dryness. ​\n\nHow can I care for hair that really only curls when the climate suits it? (Unless I use a zillion products.) How can I deal with fine, dry hair frizz and an oily scalp? What does this mess need? Please help. 🙈\n\nCurrent routine: Whole Foods brand unscented shampoo &amp; conditioner. Comb through conditioner in the shower, let sit. Rinse. Air dry. I very rarely use heat on my hair.",

      "content": "Skincare rookie here who's excited to learn more! I would love your advice on my skincare routine and whether there are things I should be thinking about adding or deleting...there are so many actives, etc. out there and it's hard to know where I should be focusing from here. \n\nContext: 33F, combination skin (leaning quite dry in winter), relatively sensitive especially when trying out new products (can cause inflammation and breakouts). As long as I'm not fiddling with too many face products, my skin is generally very clear and I get complimented a lot on the glow. Pores seem fine, a little enlarged on the nose but the normal kind. \n\nPlease note that before I started working on my skincare I was using Oil of Olay on its own and nothing else - has been that way since I was a teen. I was taught less is more and was scared to cause inflammation or breakouts by changing things up and also used to not believe in clinical studies funded by the companies themselves, so took a very uneducated / ignorance-is-bliss approach to skincare...which seemed fine given my skin was also very healthy. However I am now 33 and eager to pay more attention to my skin.  \n\nP.S. Avene Cicalfate works so ridiculously well at moisturising my skin without causing any inflammation risk at all that I was also deliberating on using it as my one-and-done night time skincare routine, but it's so gentle that I can't help but think it's missing a lot of the actives, etc. that you'd ideally want to incorporate at night...what do you guys think?\n\nMy current routine is (bear in mind I am completely new to skincare so just learning as I go) -  \n\nAM\n1. La Roche Posay Effaclar foaming cleansing gel\n2. Estee Lauder night repair serum \n3. Beauty of Joseon Dynasty cream\n4. La Roche Posay Anthelios SPF 50\n5. ...Followed by makeup (NARS radiance primer, Charlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin foundation, NARS creamy concealer, etc.)\n\nPM\n1. La Roche Posay Effaclar foaming cleansing gel\n2. Weleda skin food (however I'm seeing early signs of clogged pores so have stopped this for now and replaced with BoJ Dynasty...considering Avene Cicalfate. I need some moisture in the winter)\n\n",
