One serum. literally one: Not a cocktail. Not skin cycling. Just pick your fighter: \n\ndull--&gt;vitamin C\n\noily/breakouts --&gt; niacinamide\n\ndry/tight --&gt; hydrating serum\n\n3. Moisturiser : yes, even if you have a oily skin. Skipping this made my skin more bad.

I have been struggling with my acne recently and wanted some recommendations for gentle exfoliator for sensitive skin and acne advice if anyone has some! \n\nI started getting acne when I was a junior in college after never having had it before. I originally started using tretinoin for about 5 months but it honestly broke me out worse so I stopped. I recently graduated and want to get my skin under control. My dermatologist recently prescribed me clindamycin (which I’ve been using for about a month), 100mg of spironolactone (which I’ve been taking for about a week), and aklief (which I have used twice this week). I can tell that I am going to get some peeling from the aklief. I was wondering if anyone could suggest a exfoliator that is gentle yet will help with the peeling skin. I’ve tried Paula’s but it was to harsh for me. I was my face with cerve hydrating facial cleanser and moisture with cerve daily moisturizing lotion. Although up until recently I was using keihls anti acne moisturizing cream. Please let me know what you guys think about this mix/ any advice that might be helpful! Sorry this was so long winded and thank you if you read all this! ",

A good facewash should cleanse without stripping, and honestly that's where gentle, microbiome-friendly formulas make a difference.\n\nWhat I've noticed with pond's hydra miracle facewash is that it cleans well but still feels soft on skin. It lathers nicely, has minimal fragrance (huge win for sensitive skin), and doesn't leave that Squeaky-dry feeling. The whole idea of balancing your skin's microbiome actually matters because when your barrier is happy, your skin stays hydrated longer.\n\nIt also helps that it's not crazily priced, only slightly more than regular facewashes, but nowhere near those expensive \"gentle\" cleansers. With ingredients like Cera Hyamino (hyaluronic acid + ceramides + glycerine), it focuses on hydration while cleansing, which honestly feels like an upgrade for everyday skincare.\n\nIf you've been stuck in the dry-skin-after-washing cycle, this might be the switch your skin has been asking for.\n\nWould love to know, does your face feel tight after cleansing or comfy?",

We’ve tried a number of different shampoos, conditioners, gels, overnight curlers, skala, etc and nothing seems to help. Hairdressers have suggested shorter layers at the back, which we’ve done, and using pipe cleaners as overnight curlers but that didn’t keep either. \n\nWe do air dry as kiddo has AuDHD and can’t handle the sound of the hairdryer, and we use silk pillowcases as he also doesn’t like keeping bonnets on - he’s a side sleeper so he’s not laying directly on the back. We’ve also tried using a mini curling iron which worked for short periods, but I mostly avoid using that sort of heat on his hair. \n\nI assume it’s just two different hair types but it drives me nuts because he’s so beautifully curly at the front. Does anyone here have experience with this sort of thing and have advice or things I haven’t tried yet? TIA. ",

I shower everyday day of course but use a shower cap to keep my hair dry.\n\nMy curls have never been healthier, almost no frizz at all.\n\n\n\nBut because I do feel an itch in my scalp on the seventh day, I wonder if I am hurting my hair long term and should instead switch to twice a week shampooing ? Or is it ok to let your head get a little grimy on the final day. Not sure what is the healthiest approach ?\n\nThe other thing is that now that my hair is shoulder length detangling is taking a long time ! almost 30 minutes because I try to be gentle to avoid breakage. I wonder if my \"no touch\" rule is extreme and if it is ok to detangle everyday. \n\nWhat do you think ? What can I change to optimize? I am satisfied with the visual results though. ",

      "content": "Hello! Another mixed girl with a yt mother who didn’t know or care to learn how to do her hair 👋🏼😐 As of the last 2 years, I haven’t gotten any chemical treatment and it is now almost completely grown out (I’ve also been cutting it off in like 2-3in increments periodically). Now I just have terrible heat damage. I have NO IDEA how to do anything with my hair. I’ve been educating myself in the last couple weeks and bought a whole bunch of products. As of the last week, I stopped using heat on my hair and learning how to manage it day to day with no heat &amp; no slick backs. I’m going to be trying to learn how to braid, too, but that’s gonna take me a minute 🤣\n\nAnyway, right now my routine: I use Camille Rose Curl Love shampoo, conditioner, and leave in. During the day, I’ve been working on learning how to define my curls (that are currently non-existent). I start with a wet head, leave in (Curl Love), comb that in, section hair, curl crème (As I Am), scrunch, gel (Combat Gel watered down a bit), scrunch, then air dry or regular hair dryer. I bought a diffuser but I don’t have it yet At night, I rinse the day products out and put in a mask. I’ve been alternating every other day with Texture ID deep treatment mask and Shea Moisture Intensive Hydration mask.\n\nI am getting a hair cut (not a big chop, but the rest of my processed hair) next week, I wanted to get it professionally cut since I’ve been doing it myself. What else? What other products? Advice? Anything haha. Thank you!\n\n*First pic is dried, styled, scrunched, all that lol. Second pic is wet with leave-in",

It comes down to my Cupid’s bow (area between nose and upper lip). If I’m missing something obvious please explain it to me like I’m 5 because I can be incredibly slow. My goal is to try and get to shoulder length and have it hang there. (I’m sure a shower cap would probably be helpful after researching for myself but I’d love your input)\n\nROUTINE:\nShampoo in the shower once every 3 days with Aussie\n\nCondition pretty much everyday in the shower with Aussie. Put it in, let it sit for about 3 minutes and wash it out\n\nCantu shea butter every 3 days, slick my hair back with it, leave it for about a minute before shaking my hair, leave it in for the entire day, wash it out the next morning\n\nAir dry after every shower (I don’t use any shower cap and my hair gets wet literally every shower which I know I need to change)\n\nSleep on satin pillowcase\n\n(If you’re gonna flame me, fair. However please try to be nice I know my hair’s a mess lmao)\n",
