If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

My usual nighttime skincare routine is double cleansing + Niacinamide serum + La Roche-Posay repair cream.\n\nDuring this time, I've noticed my skin becoming smoother and more hydrated but the dullness hasn't changed significantly.

I can just see everything (dead skin, peach fuzz) and I think it’s more noticeable because I don’t shave my face.\nDo I actually need to start shaving for a clearer looking face or can this be managed through skincare alone ?\nAlso : \n• nose skin starts to peel off when I don't moisturize \n• I'm getting early forehead lines\n• slightly puffy and red eyes\n• skin has become very sensitive over the years \n\npls suggest me affordable AM &amp; PM routine with budget friendly product recos . I can’t invest in expensive products .\nAny help would be appreciated , thanks!",

      "title": "[before and after] stretch marks update",
      "content": "First three pictures are of the knee area and last three are of the hip area.\n\nAs you can see, melanin has been successfully restored in my stretch marks, indicating recovery of the dermal epidermal junction (DEJ). In mature stretch marks, the DEJ is flattened and dysfunctional, preventing proper melanocyte attachment and pigment transfer. The return of pigment shows that melanocyte keratinocyte signaling has been re established and the epidermis is behaving more like normal skin rather than scar tissue. This repigmentation is a biological sign of structural repair, not just a cosmetic color change. This improvement has been facilitated by tattoo microneedling combined with tretinoin.\n\nAdditionally, my stretch marks prior to treatment were very indented and would indent further upon stretch. Now, they are completely flat, both at rest and under tension, which suggests that the underlying dermal structure has been rebuilt rather than just masked. This flattening reflects real collagen remodeling and improved dermal support, not temporary swelling or surface changes. However, they still appear as faint ghost lines, mainly under certain lighting or when the skin is stretched. This is likely due to ongoing collagen remodeling and incomplete optical blending, rather than active scarring. At this stage, the skin structure has improved significantly, but full visual integration takes more time as collagen continues to mature and reorganize. This will probably take an additional 2-3 sessions and time…time is key. \n\nThe stretch marks are no longer behaving like inactive scars; they are now receptive to topical treatment and ongoing remodeling. This suggests the tissue has shifted into a responsive, regenerative state rather than remaining fibrotic and non receptive to treatment. Took me a very long time to reach this.\n\nI do tattoo microneedling (so I use a tattoo cartridge) every 6-8 weeks using a hyaluronic acid serum. I’ve learned that allowing longer healing intervals is critical because collagen remodeling is a slow process. After microneedling, the initial inflammation resolves within days, but true dermal repair, fibroblast activation, collagen III deposition, and later collagen I maturation, continues for several weeks. If the skin is re-injured too early, this remodeling phase is interrupted, leading to disorganized collagen, persistent inflammation, and stalled progress rather than true regeneration. By spacing sessions further apart, the tissue is allowed to fully transition from inflammation into maturation, which results in stronger dermal support, better flattening, and more stable pigment restoration over time.\n\nI also use tret daily, I used to use 0.1% but switched to 0.05% because it dried my skin. Both are effective. I also use the hydrating cerave cream after. If you have a red light panel, I suggest you also use it to speed up the process. I sadly do not. \n\nKeep in mind that this is a long and arduous process, but worth it. Don’t give up and keep going. Stretch marks are scars, they will not reverse overnight. It takes years and many sessions, not 6 or 8. In theory, meaningful reversal of mature stretch marks can take 20–30 properly performed sessions, depending on their age, depth, and initial severity. Early sessions mainly re-activate the tissue and restore responsiveness, while later sessions contribute incremental gains in collagen density, elastin organization, flattening, and optical blending.

Looked like a rough scab and it wouldn't go away no matter how much moisturiser I put on it.\n\nI decided to stop using all facial products, so no lotion, no face cream, no face wash, no soap with fragrance or acids in and no makeup. It's actually finally starting to heal a bit - but I'm worried when i reintroduce these things, it'll flare up again.\n\nAny suggestions for safer alternatives I suppose? I think it's become a sensitive area. I currently use Johnson's baby lotion and Cerave face wash and kojic acid + turmeric soap. Any good alternatives to these? And as for makeup, will it just be okay to reapply once its totally gone?",

My face doesn’t look VERY shiny. My forehead is pretty clear but not 100% clear. I think my chin is oilier than other parts of my face. I think none of my face feels dry. What skin type do I have? Thank you. ",
