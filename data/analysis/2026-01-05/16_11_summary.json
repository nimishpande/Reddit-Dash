Im back again with my reviews. + I USED AZIDERM 15\n\nDifference: Well ignore the huge brown one in the centre that scar is quite recent so i dont expect it to be gone anytime soon. THE SCARS AROUND IT HOWEVER. I have had them for around 2 and 1/2 years after picking on  my folliculities. MY DERMAT DIDNT HELP BTW. And just after 30 days THEY ARE FINALLY FADING OMG IM GONNA CRY. EVEN MY MOM (BIGGEST HATER BTW) SAID THEY BE FADING 😭🙏🙏🙏🤙🤙🤙🤙💌💌💌💌. I wear makeup everyday to hide em marks but well except for hiding that big centre one i got recently others require minimal to no makeup AT ALL. BLESSING OH GOSH 🙏🙏🙏🙏🥀🥀🥀  ANYWAY ONTO THE REVIEW\n\nFIRST OF ALL ID LIKE TO THANK \n\nAZIDERM 15 \n\nI used to use azeliac acid 10% The ordinary. Never really worked much. BUT THIS STUFF CHANGED EVERYTHING. Its very grainy and if you dont pat ur face fully dry before applying IT ITCHES AND STINGS but worth everything. I use it every next night, pea sized amount WHOLE FACE. Dot forget ur Sunscreen!! 8/10 \n\nMOVING ON TO SUNSCREEN\n\nUV DOUX D TAN \n\nWell sorry but it works but does have its own disadvantages. You need to blend it in superhard until all the white stuff disappears and trust me 2 fingers worth of it dont blend in that easily. Its quite moody AND PILLS OCCASIONALLY. Enough blending prevents pilling but if ya dont blend it for 15 full mins 🥰🥰💔💔💔💔 u are cooked. But I do feel like it provides awesome protection. 6/10\n\nMOISTURIZER\n\nHOLY GRAIL. ATODERM IS PEAK IN THESE HARSH WINTERS OH GOD. LOVE LOVE LOVE 10/10 💌💌💌🙏🙏🙏🙏\n\nSERUMS\n\nMINIMALIST NIACINAMIDE,ALPHA ARBUTIN AND RETINOL I think play a pretty huge role too \n Niacidnamide 9/10\nArbutin 8/10 (too foamy)\nRetinol 7/10 (I dont like the base oil)\n\nEYE CREAM\n\nMinimalist Retinal eyecream. Does literally nothing btw. Waste of money 3/10 just for the cooling effect. \n\n\nTHATS IT YALL BYE BYE 🔥🔥🔥🤙🤙🤙🐎🐎💦💦💦💦",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I'm from Pakistan and there are not many curl hair products /brands available here. most of my faimly has staright hair, so no one to ask what to do with these curls.)",

I live in a northern climate and wash about every other day with a good conditioning. I need to use dry shampoo the night after a wash to even make it two days. It's sometimes wavy to slightly curly in the summer. Recently, I spent a week down south and my hair became curly in the humidity. It was fun to try work with. Back to the northern climate, and I'm a dry, mostly flat mess. It's shorter than this photo now, since I can't grow length well with the dryness. ​\n\nHow can I care for hair that really only curls when the climate suits it? (Unless I use a zillion products.) How can I deal with fine, dry hair frizz and an oily scalp? What does this mess need? Please help. 🙈\n\nCurrent routine: Whole Foods brand unscented shampoo &amp; conditioner. Comb through conditioner in the shower, let sit. Rinse. Air dry. I very rarely use heat on my hair.",

      "content": "\n\nI’ve had a blunt bob for about a year, and have decided to grow it out. My stylist suggested adding layers so that the bottom doesn’t get too heavy as I grow it out, since I have quite a bit of hair. I’ve had the layers for a month now and thought that they’d grow in a bit and that I’d get used to them, but I’m still struggling. \n\nMy main struggle is that I feel like I lost too much volume at the bottom, resulting in the hair silhouette curving in towards my chin when I blow it out (pic 4). I also feel like it can look pretty dated when I blow it out and try to add more volume, kind of reminiscent of Rachel Greene’s 90’s layered bob. When I curl it, the ends of the hair flip outward and, in my opinion, kind of look like frayed ends (pics 1, 2, and 3). \n\nI had layers when my hair was long and I always loved them, but this is proving to be such a struggle. It looks fine when I put my hair half up because it hides the layers, but I don’t want to pull my hair back every day. Does anyone have any tips for styling in a way that will make it look a little more current/modern?",

      "content": "Skincare rookie here who's excited to learn more! I would love your advice on my skincare routine and whether there are things I should be thinking about adding or deleting...there are so many actives, etc. out there and it's hard to know where I should be focusing from here. \n\nContext: 33F, combination skin (leaning quite dry in winter), relatively sensitive especially when trying out new products (can cause inflammation and breakouts). As long as I'm not fiddling with too many face products, my skin is generally very clear and I get complimented a lot on the glow. Pores seem fine, a little enlarged on the nose but the normal kind. \n\nPlease note that before I started working on my skincare I was using Oil of Olay on its own and nothing else - has been that way since I was a teen. I was taught less is more and was scared to cause inflammation or breakouts by changing things up and also used to not believe in clinical studies funded by the companies themselves, so took a very uneducated / ignorance-is-bliss approach to skincare...which seemed fine given my skin was also very healthy. However I am now 33 and eager to pay more attention to my skin.  \n\nP.S. Avene Cicalfate works so ridiculously well at moisturising my skin without causing any inflammation risk at all that I was also deliberating on using it as my one-and-done night time skincare routine, but it's so gentle that I can't help but think it's missing a lot of the actives, etc. that you'd ideally want to incorporate at night...what do you guys think?\n\nMy current routine is (bear in mind I am completely new to skincare so just learning as I go) -  \n\nAM\n1. La Roche Posay Effaclar foaming cleansing gel\n2. Estee Lauder night repair serum \n3. Beauty of Joseon Dynasty cream\n4. La Roche Posay Anthelios SPF 50\n5. ...Followed by makeup (NARS radiance primer, Charlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin foundation, NARS creamy concealer, etc.)\n\nPM\n1. La Roche Posay Effaclar foaming cleansing gel\n2. Weleda skin food (however I'm seeing early signs of clogged pores so have stopped this for now and replaced with BoJ Dynasty...considering Avene Cicalfate. I need some moisture in the winter)\n\n",

Looked like a rough scab and it wouldn't go away no matter how much moisturiser I put on it.\n\nI decided to stop using all facial products, so no lotion, no face cream, no face wash, no soap with fragrance or acids in and no makeup. It's actually finally starting to heal a bit - but I'm worried when i reintroduce these things, it'll flare up again.\n\nAny suggestions for safer alternatives I suppose? I think it's become a sensitive area. I currently use Johnson's baby lotion and Cerave face wash and kojic acid + turmeric soap. Any good alternatives to these? And as for makeup, will it just be okay to reapply once its totally gone?",
