If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I’m seeing my derm again in March and will likely ask for a biopsy or skin swab.\n\nWhen it gets to this point (thickened skin, itchy, bumpy, a slightly yellowish crust), it only goes away after using Protopic 0.1%. Using it once a day, it’s gone within about 4 days. \n\nMy rosacea is mostly on my nose and causes redness, enlarged pores and pustules. I’m recently on metrogel and ivermectin for that. \n\nMy seb derm is mostly my scalp and behind my ears, I also get randomly dry, flaky and slightly swollen eyelids (unsure if seb derm or atopic derm). \n\nI started getting this rash next to my nose in March this year and it did start of sort of like seb derm, just a dry flaky patch that no moisturising helped. It slowly got worse, spread in size and to the other side of my nose (despite using Nizoral shampoo on it, which works for my scalp and ears) and no other seb derm treatments helped. \n\nI ended up needing to use Trimovate cream after it ended up crusty, weeping and painful, and then Protopic for a week or two which finally sorted it all out. \n\nSince then it comes back every month, and I just manage it with Protopic (which I’d rather not need long-term). \n\nHas anyone had anything similar and/or figure out what it is or how to manage it without Protopic?

Context &amp; History:\n​I consulted a dermatologist in Dec 2024 for \"white pimples\" on my scalp and face acne.\n​Prescription: Salicylic Acid Shampoo, a Salicylic Acid solution (for face), and Aquasoft FC cream.\n​Result: The scalp pimples reduced significantly over 3 months.\n​The Problem: The routine was too harsh for me. Even the Aquasoft FC stung my face, and I started experiencing hair fall, so I stopped everything.\n​2. Current Situation:\n​Face: I have stubborn texture and clogged pores on my cheeks/nose (see photo) and dark circles.\n​Scalp: The white pimples (folliculitis) have been still there slightly—I get about one active pimple a week.\n​3. Face plan (Gentle Approach):\n​Cleanser,\n​Serum,\n​Sunscreen.\n​4. Scalp Plan:\n​Shampoo: Scalpe Pro (Climbazole + ZPTO).\n​Growth: I want to use Rosemary Oil + Derma Stamp for the hair fall.\n​My Questions:\n​Face Sensitivity: Since Aquasoft FC stung my face last time, does that mean my barrier is damaged? \n​Scalp Safety: I still get 1 active pimple/week on my scalp. Is it safe to use a Derma Stamp now?\n​Hair Fall: Could the drying effect of the Salicylic Acid shampoo have caused the hair fall previously? Or the it's because of the white pimples?\n​Thanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Got it recommended by my aesthetician after doing my first facial ever (F38). I went there to treat my sensitive / dry skin, hopefully to remove the first lines around my mouth. My routine until then was:\n\n* Cleasing\n* Serum (Vitamin C in the morning / tretinoin in the evening)\n* Cream for dry skin, in the evening mixed with Argan oil\n\nShe told me it was wrong, because my skin is thin I should not use tretinoin at all. If my skin becomes thicker, the wrinkles will get better. Also, apparently, my skin was quite red (which I didn't notice). She recommended the following routine/cosmetics twice daily, which I now follow:\n\n* Cleansing with Net-Apax\n* Soin-Apax serum (for sensitive skin)\n* Red-Apax serum (only on cheeks and nose for the cuperosis I didn't know I have)\n* Salva-derm cream (for winter, for summer she suggests another one)\n\nThis cost a lot, then again, the cosmetics I've used before were just slightly cheaper. If it does anything, I'd consider it worth it, but tbh, it's been almost a month now and the results are underwhelming. My skin feels better (very even) and is indeed less red, which makes for a better skin-tone. At a distance, I do look better because of it.\n\nHowever, I went there to treat my wrinkles and if anything, they look worse now. Also, my skin feels less moisturized. My aesthetician told me that my skin could feel weird in the beginning because the prebiotics need time to work, but I should trust the process. By now everything should be normalized and while I see how there are improvements with skin-tone and texture the problems I've addressed are still there and even worsened.\n\nSo... Do any of you have experiences with this? Have I been scammed? She was very professional and offered budget-friendlier alternatives, by the way. It was me who said I'll try the best and decide later if it's worth it. Also, the product lasts a long time, you really don't need much. She's offering micro-needling which I considered and she basically talked me out of it, saying I'm too young and that I can achieve good results with the right skincare. I'm doubting that.",

I did a balayage about a year ago, and yesterday I went back in to redo it (I know its been a while, but hadn't made time and was okay with it growing out). I was in the salon from about 10am to ~6:30/7pm, which I expected given my hair color.\nIn the salon it looked good, but this morning I’m noticing random brassy/orangey pieces that weren’t obvious yesterday. It’s not everywhere, just certain strands.\nFor context:\nI have very dark hair and regularly dye my roots about every 3 weeks because my greys come in fast (my stylist does this).\nMy stylist said the brassiness is likely where old dark dye was present and the cuticle didn’t fully lift. She said with toning and washing over time, it should start evening itself out\nWhile I was there, she actually toned me twice, the first toner came out very brassy, to the point where even other stylists in the salon mentioned it needed to be re-toned. The second toner definitely improved things, but now I’m still seeing brassiness the next morning.\n\nI’m not trying to bash my stylist, I genuinely just hate sitting in the chair for 6+ hours and want to understand if:\nThis is genuinely normal immediately after balayage on very dark, frequently dyed hair?\nOr if this usually means it needs another tone or correction sooner rather than later?\nStylists or anyone with similar hair, is this expected, or is it something I should address now?\n\n\nTL;DR: Very dark hair, frequent root dye every ~3 weeks, refreshed balayage yesterday. Toned twice (first was very brassy). Looked fine in salon, but next morning I’m seeing random brassy pieces. Stylist says it’s from old dark dye and will even out with washing — is this normal or does it usually need another tone?",

Got graduation coming up in a few months and in a last ditch effort to have something decent on my head by the time that comes, I've switched from finasteride to 0.5mg dutasteride and Oral Minoxidil 2.5mg. (My university life was shit because I was a 30 year old looking man in a class of people in their 20s).\n\nIt's truly tiring. You wake up, brush your teeth and the first thing your reminded of is how old you look, because of your balding. You can't escape it, the beast follows you everywhere you go, you're about to leave the house, but of course you've forgotten that it isn't actually a key that lets you out of your door, it's a hat. \n\nI'm tired man. This constant battle is exhausting. I'm desperately searching for a part-time job, so that I can save up for a hair transplant, but nothing yet. My parents aren't rich so that isn't an option. But even if I do get a hair transplant, I have diffuse thinning, so my hair still looks shit. I'll wait 6 months and see what this new treatment plan does for me.\n\nI've been balding since 13 so I've been living with this my whole adolescent and adult life damn near. I can't even image what it was like to have a full head of hair. It sucks man. And so many guys in here are dealing with the same shit, we are under 25 and are at the balding stage of a man in his mid 30's. Being an incel isn't a choice as the name suggest. I know some fools say it is but they can go fuck themselves. Then you have those idiots in balding sub that tell teens and young men to shave their heads and lose any chance they have at getting laid or being confident loooll. \"It's freedom!\" they say lol. Bro I shaved my head and I looked fucking ugly haha. \n\nWhy should a young guy have to be thinking about balding bro? This is actually comical to me and the worst part is NO ONE your age is going through the same thing cuz your young asf and look 30 without a hat ahhahaaha. Fuck this world, I swear this hair loss shit at a young age gives you a mental disorder. \n\nAnyway super depressed rn, will be fine in the morning probably, but yeah that's an update.",
