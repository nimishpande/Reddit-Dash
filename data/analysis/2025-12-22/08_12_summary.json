It did nothing. I was on spirinolactone and it helped slightly but still not completely, and I moved to a different country in the meantime where that is harder to access.\n\nI did lasers and chemical peels and they also helped a bit but still not 100%. Topicals did nothing for me but make my skin burn and peel. I’m 26 now and was just about ready to give up. I started drinking 1-2 cups of peppermint tea a day about 2 weeks ago, and then also got spearmint supplements and take 800mgs of that in the morning.\n\nMy skin is finally clearing up and I’m trying not to be overly hopeful just in case it doesn’t work but i’m so so happy about it. Even my new breakouts are small, normal looking pimples that I can actually ignore and treat properly instead of cysts that scar and hurt if I do nothing. It’s still not 100% but it’s just so much better and i’m sure with more time (especially for my discoloration to go away)  it will be soooo much better.",

I started treatment back in 2020 during covid, starting on 1 mg of Fin which I split up into multiple doses. After a couple of months of that with no sides, I started taking the full dose. At that time, I also was microneedling, but that has fallen out of my routine (fear of needles, youch).\n\nI'd still catch photos of myself from behind and get self conscious about my large bald spot, so last January I started on a Fin + oral min dose and I feel like it helped me regrow a lot.

      "content": "(reupload cause I made a mistake adding photos to first post)\n\nHello skincare junkies, thank you for reading. As the title hints, I have been experiencing discouraging results with my skincare journey. I've been working on my routine for quite a while, but my acne never seems to get better, even though the quality of my skin has improved.\n\nI've attached some images showing what I look like right now at my worst, what my skin looks like at its best, and the products I use. My morning routine involves washing my face with warm water and Round Lab Birch Juice Cleanser, rinsing with cold water, and then applying Madagascar Centella Ampoule, snail mucin, and finally CeraVe AM moisturizer. At night, I use Benzoyl Peroxide 10% and 2.5% Retinol for my acne while keeping my face washing the same.\n\nThe skin on my face has become much softer and better-looking after sticking with this routine for three months, but as I said, my acne has stayed the same. I've tried different diets: over a month with no dairy and 2-3 months without sugar while eating healthier in general, but there is no visible change. My normal diet consists of mostly unprocessed foods and very little sugar, with tea and water being my main drinks. I also work out consistently and shower every day, and sweat and body odors are not something I struggle with at all.\n\nAll this leads me to believe my acne is either hormonal or caused by stress (engineering classes😭). I have visited a dermatologist and was prescribed retinol and a topical antibiotic for six months, but this did not seem to affect my condition either. Some have suggested spearmint tea helps with hormonal acne, which I am considering trying, but as of right now, I'm lost on what to do. Could my current skincare routine be making it worse? Or is there something else I'm missing? I'm getting really tired of looking at myself with shame and losing my confidence. I find it hard to take myself seriously when I know I look like this. I love public presentation and I think I would be so much more confident if I could overcome this.\n\nThank you guys for reading this even though it's long. I appreciate your help and what you all provide to this sub. 🥺😖🥰",

If all else fails, I’ll use it on something I purchase at Ulta frequently, but I also think this may be a good opportunity to branch out and buy something that I may not always think to buy for myself. I don’t wear a ton of makeup and the makeup I do wear I do the same basically every day, so I’m thinking more along the lines of skincare or hair care or other self-care things. Is there anything along those lines I could purchase at Ulta that you swear by? I’m particularly interested in recommendations of things such as face/hair masks and products to help my skin texture (I have mostly clear skin but my forehead texture is a bit rough and could use some clarifying) and some face/undereye puffiness (I’m a teacher so I def don’t get enough sleep haha), but any recommendations are welcome! Sorry if this is a vague question just searching for some general recommendations :) ",

They don’t “pop” like blackheads, and even when I extract or exfoliate, they come back within days.\n\nSome context:\nMy nose feels dry or tight sometimes, but clearly still produces oil because these are always visible\nI used to scrub/exfoliate a lot earlier, which I’ve stopped\nI don’t use pore strips anymore\nI do have slight pigmentation around the nose, so I’m cautious about irritation\nCurrently not using a retinoid yet, but researching adapalene/retinoids for long-term control\nWhat I’ve noticed:\nSalicylic acid helps temporarily, but the filaments always return\nClay masks give short-term smoothness only\nOverdoing anything makes my nose darker and more irritated\nFrom what I understand, sebaceous filaments are normal structures and can’t be “removed permanently”, only managed. But I’m curious about real experiences, not marketing claims.\nMy questions:\nDo you have similar sebaceous filaments on your nose?\nWhat actually helped you long-term (months, not days)?\nDid retinoids make a noticeable difference for you? If yes, which one and how often?\nDid anyone notice worsening pigmentation or irritation around the nose, and how did you handle it?\nAt what point did you just accept them vs actively treating them?\nI’m not chasing glass skin or filters. I just want to reduce how prominent they look without damaging my skin barrier.\nWould really appreciate experiences from people who’ve dealt with this consistently, especially oily/dehydrated skin types.",

I haven’t changed anything major, so I’m confused why this is happening all of a sudden.\n\nI’m trying to keep my routine very minimal and gentle right now, but the bumps don’t seem to be calming yet.\n\nHas anyone with dry or sensitive skin experienced something like this?\nDid it turn out to be temporary irritation, hormonal, or something else?\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would really help.

      "content": "hi, im not an expert on skincare stuff but i do know a bit of basics after a bit of research, so pls go slowly on me ^^ this is a routine help and also a product request btw, so i have lots of questions\n\ni have broken skin barrier since probably i was a teen, i never know what it was cause i always have acne prone, sensitive, and combo skin so i thought its how that is. i just learned about it cause i recently have redness and dryness around my mouth either caused by eczema (which i have but never happened on face before) or perioral dermatitis. i just got avene cicafate like earlier today to repair it tho, maybe will also get lrps cicaplast to maintain afterwards.\n\nanyways im aware that repairing my skin barrier is quite simple, its just using gentle cleanser (cetaphil gentle cleanser), moisturizer for hydration (cerave moisturizing cream), and sunscreen for day (skin aqua uv brightening moisture gel). i will be adding cicafate after moisturizer and skin barrier will be expected to heal about 6 weeks. also gotta look for hydrating ingredients like ceramide and hyaluronic acid.\n\nnow my main questions r in the next sections so pls bear with me...\n\nafter repairing, i want to try healing my acne spots, acne scars, prevent acne and brighten uneven skintone. i decided to get salicylic, hyaluronic acids, and niacinamide, would it be too much to use them together everyday? if not, i probably won't be able to get them so soon anyways, im a student on a budget 😅 i also heard that its not good to use cicafate/cicaplast with acids, so how do i maintain the skin barrier? i saw someone said that they maintain by using cicafate as a sleep mask twice a week, would this work without using the acids on those nights or is there a better method? also after using cicafate/cicaplast for a long time, do i still continue using it to maintain or i can leave them if i can maintain my skin barrier properly?\n\ni do need recommendations for salicylic, hyaluronic acids, and niacinamide. the only ones ik about r the ones from the ordinary. i used anua peach niacinamide before a year ago but didnt see any improvements, now im not sure if i should give it a go again considering it may be blocked by my broken skin barrier. or maybe its 5% so its not stronge enough for me, if thats the case, should i try with the ordinary 10% niacinamide instead?\n\ni also need toner recommendations, rn im using simple soothing toner for awhile which is a very budget drugstore, got it purely cause i have no choice since im only allowed budget options but its obvious that i dont see any improvements from using it at all... so i really need a good budget option like less than usd20? i do have a few options i found may be good but im not confident:\n1. anua heartleaf soothing toner\n2. round lab dokdo toner\n3. anua rice toner\n4. skin1004 centella toner\n5. ordinary glycolic acid toner\n\nlastly, what would be the ideal routine after all these? this is what i wrote in my notes: cleanse, toner, salicylic acid (bha, not to use for repair skin barrier), hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, mask, moisturize, cicalfate (maintain as night use for overnight mask no moisturizer), and sunscreen.\n\n(btw i also have anua cleansing oil, tho i rarely use cause i dont wear makeup and dont see any improvements so idk if i should might as well continue using until finish)\n\nedit: forgot to add this, but i actually always rinse my face like once or twice during the day cause of my oily face, like around 1pm and 6pm. i always reapply moisturizer after that, do i also need to reapply sunscreen and cicafate too?",

Ouidad Anti-frizz shampoo \n2. InnerSense Conditioner- BounceCurl detangler brush \n3. AG Beach Bomb Cream - rake\n4. Either BounceCurl clump cream or AG Recoil - rake\n5. InnerSense I Create Volume serum - rake\n6. InnerSense I Create Curl Memory gel - rake\n7. BounceCurl EdgeLift brush - sections \n8. Biosilk Rock Hard gelee - glaze &amp; scrunch \n9. Laifen SE diffuser \n10. Righteous Roots hair oil- scrunch out the cast  \n\nTonight it was just shampoo, conditioner (rinsed well) and BounceCurl brush, and diffuser. \n\nWhat I think this affirmed for me is that:\n1. My many curly-hair products do not \"weigh down\" my wavy-curly hair\n2. My hair without products still looks much better and less frizzy than it used to when I brushed it after towel drying because I'm treating it like curly hair and not defective straight hair.\n3. With products and styling, my hair is glossier, shiny-er, curlier, and more defined.\n4. Instead of looking great with a little refreshing, my hair will be a frizzy bush tomorrow and the days following, and will go up in a silicone curly tie and stay there until I feel up to (or be allowed to) take a shower and do my full routine \n5. And most importantly, that there is immense value in my twice-a-week routine that makes my time &amp; money well spent.\n\nI love my wavy-curly hair!!!!",

I used to use Dr Sheth for a long time and stopped using it a year back because A. It’s owned by Honasa now and B. It didn’t help with tanning, at all, even with reapplication throughour the day. \n\nPlease suggest some good reccos for dry, acne prone sensitive skin, even if they’re Pharmacy sunscreens, I’d love to go for them, in fact, I think I’d be able to trust it more.
