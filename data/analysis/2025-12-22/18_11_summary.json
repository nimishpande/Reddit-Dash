      "content": "Hi everyone, I’m looking for advice because this has been persistent for over a year and I’m running out of ideas.\n\nI have ongoing red, inflamed bumps on the same cheek area (sometimes extending toward the nose/mouth). They feel burning and tight rather than itchy, and when squeezed they sometimes release a white head, but they don’t behave like typical acne. The rest of my face is usually clear. What I’ve tried so far:\n\n\t•\tGentle cleansers and soothing serums\n\t•\tBarrier creams (Cicalfate-type products)\n\t•\tBenzoyl peroxide\n\t•\tAlcohol-based clindamycin (made it worse)\n\t•\tOral doxycycline\n\t•\tZero therapy (helped calm it but didn’t fully resolve it)\n\nDespite antibiotics and simplifying my routine, it never fully clears and always comes back in the same area. I’ve also seen a dermatologist, but the main suggestion was to try Roaccutane again. I previously started isotretinoin and had to stop after about 4 weeks because it significantly affected my stomach/gut and appetite, to the point where I was struggling to eat.\n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "First time posting here, but I've been getting facials off and on for almost 2 years. My last one was about 2 months ago, but my regular esthetician was unavailable so one of her colleagues did it. My skin looked great afterwards, though I was a little put off by some of the comments she made regarding my regular esthetician's product advice and recommendations. She also went on a whole tangent about how Cerave cleansers are trash.\n\nSo, I'm wondering what your thoughts are and specifically, which products from Dermalogica tend to be worth the cost? I already use the milkfoliant to exfoliate 2-3x a week (suggested by regular esthetician over a year ago) but this other colleague suggested the daily cleansing gel and active moist moisturizer. I don't have the money to purchase all Dermalogica products, but I do think they work well on my skin and would be open to purchasing those that would give the best benefits.\n\nQuick overview of my skin:  \n\\- fair, 27F, often described as \"dehydrated\" but \"healthy\"  \n\\- tend to get congestion in my T zone and behind the ears, esp in the summer because I exercise a lot  \n\\- recently have been picking a lot...squeezing whiteheads and sebaceous filaments which is causing redness, breakouts (I know, I know...I need to stop)\n\nGeneral skincare routine:  \n\\- Cerave hydrating cleanser (once a day in the winter, 2x rest of the year)  \n\\- The Ordinary hylauronic acid  \n\\- Vitamin C serum  \n\\- Neutrogena sunscreen (pls if anyone has good recs lmk because I have yet to find something I actually like)  \n\\- Dermalogica milkfoliant as an exfoliator (2-3x a week)  \n\\*\\* I tend to fall out of this routine when I'm really stressed...but at a minimum I wear sunscreen every day!",

Personally, I’d like to wean off the Cabtreo cream because I just don’t like the thought of using a topical antibiotic regularly for so long. I’d like to switch over to adapalene instead since my skin has already been exposed to it in the cream formulation.\n\nMy dermatologist said I can just start straight away with Azelaic Acid daily, but I’m nervous because I have VERY sensitive skin. I’m trying to figure out how best to incorporate it into my morning routine and how often in the beginning phase. Can it go after my toner and serum? Or does it need to go directly on dry cleansed skin? Also, is there a ‘’purge’’ or adjustment period?\n\nMy next question would be when/how to add in adapalene to the mix here. Any suggestions would be very helpful!\n\nThank you all in advance!",

      "content": "I’m looking for recommendations for an affordable (under $30 a tube) daily face sunscreen that won’t burn my eyes. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and eyes, and some undiagnosed skin condition that is probably eczema. I need something 50+ SPF or higher, preferably not drying, strongly scented, tinted (I’m really pale and tinted sunscreen oxidizes orange on me), no oxybenzone or other common allergens, and not overly oily.\n\nIdeally I'd like it to be moisturizing enough to not need a separate moisturizer underneath, with a dewy or skin-like finish, as I get dry, flaky spots with matte formulations.\n\nI’ve tried a TON of sunscreens, as I use tretinoin. I’ve only found one sunscreen that doesn’t burn unbearably AND feels okay on the skin- Trader Joe’s Enrich Moisturizing Face Lotion with SPF 15. But SPF 15 is too low.\n\nThree other sunscreens don’t burn, but I hate how they feel: Vanicream Facial Moisturizer for Sensitive Skin SPF 30, Eucerin Gentle Protection Daily Lotion &amp; Sunscreen SPF 30, and Abib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar SPF 50++.\n\nI’m going to offer a lot of information that I hope helps, but I’ll have a TLDR too.\n\nFeel free to critique other parts of my routine- I’m always looking to improve it.\n\n**Skin Type:** I have pretty dry, mildly acne-prone, and flaky skin that gets irritated extremely easily. I react really poorly to most skincare- I get dry flaky patches, redness, itchiness, tightness, painful burns, or I break out. Sunscreen is the worst culprit of all- not only does my skin react (usually with itchiness or stinging), but most sunscreens sting my eyes unrelentingly, no matter how far away I keep the product from my eyes.\n\n**Current Skincare Routine:**\n\n**Night:**\n\nCleanser: Either La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser or CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, if I’m wearing light makeup I remove it with water or argan oil, if heavy makeup (almost never) I’ll double cleanse with Ponds Cold Cream.\n\nActives: Tretinoin 0.025% Cream every 1-2 nights (this is new, started about 6 months ago). I wait about 10 minutes after washing before putting it on, and then about 20 after putting it on before moisturizing.\n\nMoisturizer: I mix Egyptian Magic with Vanicream. I put extra Egyptian Magic on my eyes and lips.\n\n**Morning:**\n\nCleanser: My skin doesn’t react well to over-cleansing, so I usually just do nothing or rinse with water and pat my skin dry.\n\nSunscreen: I follow up with my current pick (that I don’t like), Abib Quick Sunstick.\n\n**Sunscreens I’ve Tried (and why I hated them):**\n\nTrader Joes Daily Facial Sunscreen SPF 40: burns eyes, formula sucks, so oily and drying at the same time.\n\nTrader Joes Daily Facial Mineral Sunscreen SPF 40: burns eyes, formula sucks, oily and drying.\n\nVanicream Facial Moisturizer for Sensitive Skin SPF 30- doesn’t burn but formula sucks, thick and oily, never dries down.\n\nByoma Ultra-Lightweight Face Fluid SPF 30;’ I like the way it looks on the skin, and it didn’t break me out in scales, but burns my eyes.\n\nEucerin Gentle Protection Daily Lotion &amp; Sunscreen SPF 30: doesn’t burn, but I’d like longer-lasting hydration, the formula enhances my dry patches by 1000x.\n\nCerave Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50: burned a bit but tolerable, way too greasy and has a strong blue tint, even on pale skin.\n\nNeutrogena Ultra-Sheer Dry Touch : This hurt my eyes so badly, they were red and teary for hours.\n\nAbib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar SPF 50++: The best so far! It’s a little too greasy, but I liked the stick application, it didn’t burn my eyes or accentuate my dry spots.\n\nRaw Elements Face+Body SPF 30: I liked the tin, but the formula was thick and greasy.\n\nSun Bum SPF 50: Burned my eyes.\n\n**TLDR;** Looking for a semi-affordable face sunscreen for very sensitive skin that is natural or dewy finish, moisturizing without being too greasy, SPF 50 or higher, not tinted, and won't burn my eyes.",

Ouidad Anti-frizz shampoo \n2. InnerSense Conditioner- BounceCurl detangler brush \n3. AG Beach Bomb Cream - rake\n4. Either BounceCurl clump cream or AG Recoil - rake\n5. InnerSense I Create Volume serum - rake\n6. InnerSense I Create Curl Memory gel - rake\n7. BounceCurl EdgeLift brush - sections \n8. Biosilk Rock Hard gelee - glaze &amp; scrunch \n9. Laifen SE diffuser \n10. Righteous Roots hair oil- scrunch out the cast  \n\nTonight it was just shampoo, conditioner (rinsed well) and BounceCurl brush, and diffuser. \n\nWhat I think this affirmed for me is that:\n1. My many curly-hair products do not \"weigh down\" my wavy-curly hair\n2. My hair without products still looks much better and less frizzy than it used to when I brushed it after towel drying because I'm treating it like curly hair and not defective straight hair.\n3. With products and styling, my hair is glossier, shiny-er, curlier, and more defined.\n4. Instead of looking great with a little refreshing, my hair will be a frizzy bush tomorrow and the days following, and will go up in a silicone curly tie and stay there until I feel up to (or be allowed to) take a shower and do my full routine \n5. And most importantly, that there is immense value in my twice-a-week routine that makes my time &amp; money well spent.\n\nI love my wavy-curly hair!!!!",

The past 2 years it's been a lot better and now I only get a few breakouts here and there if any.*\n\nI currently have 4 main skin issues I'd like to address:\n\n**1.** Very **enlarged pores** (and I mean it. It looks like I have holes on my skin)\n\n**2.** A few **scars** from picking on my skin (I have a nail scar on my left cheek lol) and **icepick scars**\n\n**3.** **Discoloration** (not a huge issue, but it's quite there) \n\n**4.** **Rough texture** on forehead and cheekbones\n\nI am thinking about investing on getting professional microneedling. My questions are:\n\n**1.** Approximately, **how many sessions** are needed?\n\n**2.** I've found a place that offers **microdermabrasion and microneedling in the same session**. Any thoughts about that? Has anyone tried this before?\n\n**3. When should I expect to see results**, assuming I'm getting my first session on January? Is May/ June too early/ unrealistic?\n\n**4.** Has anybody addressed any of the mentioned issues using micronedling? If so, how long did it take? Do you think it's worth it?\n\n**5.** I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's true: I have chubby cheeks and chubby face in general that has led to me having some minor jowls that make me look older that I am. **Could microneedling help address jowls?**\n\nAlso, if you have any other recommendation for a facial treatment that would help me address my concerns please write me in the comments :(\n\n*My current routine is:*\n\n***DAY***\n\n*1. cerave hydrating cleanser*\n\n*2. skin1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum SPF50+* ***OR*** *summer fridays mineral milk suncreen* ***OR*** *la roche posay anthelios (the green tube)*\n\n***NIGHT***\n\n*1. the inkey list oat cleansing balm*\n\n*2. cerave hydrating cleanser*\n\n*3. paula's choice salicylic acid toner (3 times a week)*\n\n*4. skin1004 centella amplule*\n\n*5. cosrx advanced snail 92 all in one cream*\n\n*(I also normally use tazarotene, but it's been a month since I finished my tube and if I'm getting into microneedling, I'll probably take a break from it)*",

The next up thing that irritates me about my skin is how clogged/dry/ rough it looks. I want to know what procedures dermatologist can do in office that can help with this. No product, and i mean NO product has helped. Anything applied topically has never helped, to clear my acne I literally had to get on accutane. I’ve been using tazarotene for about 6 months now and it’s done nothing for me, specifically my t zone. Now I’m looking for procedures. I will eventually get rf micro needling done. But I want to clear up these CCs first preferably.  Open to answer and questions. Currently I use a very simple skin routine. Cetaphil morning and night(some days just water if I feel dry) and tazarotene nightly.",

      "content": "hi! id like to seek recommendations on what skincare routines can be done if panoxyl benzoyl peroxide 4% cleanser will be used? a lil bit of context, i used this since 2024 along with a cica moisturizer gel, and incorporated the omi sun bears sunscreen last month, and cleared my hormonal acne as i had it since junior high. yet, i chose to stop it recently because i felt that my skin barrier got damaged and pimples had appeared.\n\nso, i replaced it with a salicylic cleanser one as i have an oily, acne-prone skin, only for cystic acne to appear all over my face and worsen what i initially had. i used the salicylic for 3 days. now, i returned to the panoxyl, hoping to shrink the cystic pimples, and it did prevent those that are about to appear yet.\n\ncurrently, my cystic acne is inflamed and i don't think it's the salicylic acid cleanser purging because pimples appeared on less acne-prone areas. i was hoping to hear out some recommendations. thank you so much! :D",
