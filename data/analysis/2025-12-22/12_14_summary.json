I started treatment back in 2020 during covid, starting on 1 mg of Fin which I split up into multiple doses. After a couple of months of that with no sides, I started taking the full dose. At that time, I also was microneedling, but that has fallen out of my routine (fear of needles, youch).\n\nI'd still catch photos of myself from behind and get self conscious about my large bald spot, so last January I started on a Fin + oral min dose and I feel like it helped me regrow a lot. I didn't really notice a lot of shedding then, and I'm really happy with the progress I've since.\n\nJust wanted to share my success with you all. I know that some of us have worries about sides, but I got really lucky with that.\n\n\\-Edit- Treatment details:\n\nDecember 2020 - 2025 Jan. 1 mg of Fin and Nizoral (every other shower) from 2020 - 2025 Jan.\n\n2025 Feb - Current: 1.2 of fin and 3 mg of min orally, Nizoral shampoo ever other shower.",

      "title": "[Acne] Skin is improving 😁🥹 but acne is getting worse 😮‍💨😭",
      "content": "(reupload cause I made a mistake adding photos to first post)\n\nHello skincare junkies, thank you for reading. As the title hints, I have been experiencing discouraging results with my skincare journey. I've been working on my routine for quite a while, but my acne never seems to get better, even though the quality of my skin has improved.\n\nI've attached some images showing what I look like right now at my worst, what my skin looks like at its best, and the products I use. My morning routine involves washing my face with warm water and Round Lab Birch Juice Cleanser, rinsing with cold water, and then applying Madagascar Centella Ampoule, snail mucin, and finally CeraVe AM moisturizer. At night, I use Benzoyl Peroxide 10% and 2.5% Retinol for my acne while keeping my face washing the same.\n\nThe skin on my face has become much softer and better-looking after sticking with this routine for three months, but as I said, my acne has stayed the same. I've tried different diets: over a month with no dairy and 2-3 months without sugar while eating healthier in general, but there is no visible change. My normal diet consists of mostly unprocessed foods and very little sugar, with tea and water being my main drinks. I also work out consistently and shower every day, and sweat and body odors are not something I struggle with at all.\n\nAll this leads me to believe my acne is either hormonal or caused by stress (engineering classes😭). I have visited a dermatologist and was prescribed retinol and a topical antibiotic for six months, but this did not seem to affect my condition either. Some have suggested spearmint tea helps with hormonal acne, which I am considering trying, but as of right now, I'm lost on what to do. Could my current skincare routine be making it worse? Or is there something else I'm missing? I'm getting really tired of looking at myself with shame and losing my confidence. I find it hard to take myself seriously when I know I look like this. I love public presentation and I think I would be so much more confident if I could overcome this.\n\nThank you guys for reading this even though it's long. I appreciate your help and what you all provide to this sub. 🥺😖🥰",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n​I need help building a safe routine for my face and scalp. I have a history of successful but harsh dermatological treatment and I want to restart carefully.\n​1. Context &amp; History:\n​I consulted a dermatologist in Dec 2024 for \"white pimples\" on my scalp and face acne.\n​Prescription: Salicylic Acid Shampoo, a Salicylic Acid solution (for face), and Aquasoft FC cream.\n​Result: The scalp pimples reduced significantly over 3 months.\n​The Problem: The routine was too harsh for me. Even the Aquasoft FC stung my face, and I started experiencing hair fall, so I stopped everything.\n​2. Current Situation:\n​Face: I have stubborn texture and clogged pores on my cheeks/nose (see photo) and dark circles.\n​Scalp: The white pimples (folliculitis) have been still there slightly—I get about one active pimple a week.\n​3. Face plan (Gentle Approach):\n​Cleanser,\n​Serum,\n​Sunscreen.\n​4. Scalp Plan:\n​Shampoo: Scalpe Pro (Climbazole + ZPTO).\n​Growth: I want to use Rosemary Oil + Derma Stamp for the hair fall.\n​My Questions:\n​Face Sensitivity: Since Aquasoft FC stung my face last time, does that mean my barrier is damaged? \n​Scalp Safety: I still get 1 active pimple/week on my scalp. Is it safe to use a Derma Stamp now?\n​Hair Fall: Could the drying effect of the Salicylic Acid shampoo have caused the hair fall previously? Or the it's because of the white pimples?\n​Thanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Got it recommended by my aesthetician after doing my first facial ever (F38). I went there to treat my sensitive / dry skin, hopefully to remove the first lines around my mouth. My routine until then was:\n\n* Cleasing\n* Serum (Vitamin C in the morning / tretinoin in the evening)\n* Cream for dry skin, in the evening mixed with Argan oil\n\nShe told me it was wrong, because my skin is thin I should not use tretinoin at all. If my skin becomes thicker, the wrinkles will get better. Also, apparently, my skin was quite red (which I didn't notice). She recommended the following routine/cosmetics twice daily, which I now follow:\n\n* Cleansing with Net-Apax\n* Soin-Apax serum (for sensitive skin)\n* Red-Apax serum (only on cheeks and nose for the cuperosis I didn't know I have)\n* Salva-derm cream (for winter, for summer she suggests another one)\n\nThis cost a lot, then again, the cosmetics I've used before were just slightly cheaper. If it does anything, I'd consider it worth it, but tbh, it's been almost a month now and the results are underwhelming. My skin feels better (very even) and is indeed less red, which makes for a better skin-tone. At a distance, I do look better because of it.\n\nHowever, I went there to treat my wrinkles and if anything, they look worse now. Also, my skin feels less moisturized. My aesthetician told me that my skin could feel weird in the beginning because the prebiotics need time to work, but I should trust the process. By now everything should be normalized and while I see how there are improvements with skin-tone and texture the problems I've addressed are still there and even worsened.\n\nSo... Do any of you have experiences with this? Have I been scammed? She was very professional and offered budget-friendlier alternatives, by the way. It was me who said I'll try the best and decide later if it's worth it. Also, the product lasts a long time, you really don't need much. She's offering micro-needling which I considered and she basically talked me out of it, saying I'm too young and that I can achieve good results with the right skincare. I'm doubting that.",

      "content": "I’m attaching a close-up photo of my nose because I want genuine opinions, not influencer advice.\nI’m pretty sure these are sebaceous filaments, not blackheads. They’re evenly spaced, greyish dots, mostly on the tip and sides of my nose. They don’t “pop” like blackheads, and even when I extract or exfoliate, they come back within days.\n\nSome context:\nMy nose feels dry or tight sometimes, but clearly still produces oil because these are always visible\nI used to scrub/exfoliate a lot earlier, which I’ve stopped\nI don’t use pore strips anymore\nI do have slight pigmentation around the nose, so I’m cautious about irritation\nCurrently not using a retinoid yet, but researching adapalene/retinoids for long-term control\nWhat I’ve noticed:\nSalicylic acid helps temporarily, but the filaments always return\nClay masks give short-term smoothness only\nOverdoing anything makes my nose darker and more irritated\nFrom what I understand, sebaceous filaments are normal structures and can’t be “removed permanently”, only managed. But I’m curious about real experiences, not marketing claims.\nMy questions:\nDo you have similar sebaceous filaments on your nose?\nWhat actually helped you long-term (months, not days)?\nDid retinoids make a noticeable difference for you? If yes, which one and how often?\nDid anyone notice worsening pigmentation or irritation around the nose, and how did you handle it?\nAt what point did you just accept them vs actively treating them?\nI’m not chasing glass skin or filters. I just want to reduce how prominent they look without damaging my skin barrier.\nWould really appreciate experiences from people who’ve dealt with this consistently, especially oily/dehydrated skin types.",

If all else fails, I’ll use it on something I purchase at Ulta frequently, but I also think this may be a good opportunity to branch out and buy something that I may not always think to buy for myself. I don’t wear a ton of makeup and the makeup I do wear I do the same basically every day, so I’m thinking more along the lines of skincare or hair care or other self-care things. Is there anything along those lines I could purchase at Ulta that you swear by? I’m particularly interested in recommendations of things such as face/hair masks and products to help my skin texture (I have mostly clear skin but my forehead texture is a bit rough and could use some clarifying) and some face/undereye puffiness (I’m a teacher so I def don’t get enough sleep haha), but any recommendations are welcome! Sorry if this is a vague question just searching for some general recommendations :) ",
