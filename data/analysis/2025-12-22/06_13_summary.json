At that time, I also was microneedling, but that has fallen out of my routine (fear of needles, youch).\n\nI'd still catch photos of myself from behind and get self conscious about my large bald spot, so last January I started on a Fin + oral min dose and I feel like it helped me regrow a lot. I didn't really notice a lot of shedding then, and I'm really happy with the progress I've since.\n\nJust wanted to share my success with you all. I know that some of us have worries about sides, but I got really lucky with that.\n\n  \n\\-Edit- Treatment details: \n\n\n\nDecember 2020 - 2025 Jan. 1 mg of Fin and Nizoral (every other shower) from 2020 - 2025 Jan. \n\n2025 Feb - Current: 1.1 of fin and 3 mg of min orally, Nizoral shampoo ever other shower.

Topicals did nothing for me but make my skin burn and peel. I’m 26 now and was just about ready to give up. I started drinking 1-2 cups of peppermint tea a day about 2 weeks ago, and then also got spearmint supplements and take 800mgs of that in the morning.\n\nMy skin is finally clearing up and I’m trying not to be overly hopeful just in case it doesn’t work but i’m so so happy about it. Even my new breakouts are small, normal looking pimples that I can actually ignore and treat properly instead of cysts that scar and hurt if I do nothing. It’s still not 100% but it’s just so much better and i’m sure with more time (especially for my discoloration to go away)  it will be soooo much better.",

If all else fails, I’ll use it on something I purchase at Ulta frequently, but I also think this may be a good opportunity to branch out and buy something that I may not always think to buy for myself. I don’t wear a ton of makeup and the makeup I do wear I do the same basically every day, so I’m thinking more along the lines of skincare or hair care or other self-care things. Is there anything along those lines I could purchase at Ulta that you swear by? I’m particularly interested in recommendations of things such as face/hair masks and products to help my skin texture (I have mostly clear skin but my forehead texture is a bit rough and could use some clarifying) and some face/undereye puffiness (I’m a teacher so I def don’t get enough sleep haha), but any recommendations are welcome! Sorry if this is a vague question just searching for some general recommendations :) ",

      "content": "(pics are after showering and moisturizing) I have struggled with acne all my life. For about 8-9 years I was on hormonal BC and Spironolactone which kept my skin pretty clear. For personal reasons I stopped this combo and would prefer to avoid starting it again if possible. I also used to be on 0.05% Tretinoin but my skin started having adverse reactions so I went down to a gentler retinoid. I stopped the aforementioned medications over a year ago and my skin was mostly fine until a few months ago, and it has looked like the pics ever since.\n\nI was using a lot of Korean skincare but have cut down a lot on products to try different things and simplify my routine but nothing seems to be helping much.\n\nI double cleanse with Cerave oil cleanser &amp; hydrating water cleanser. I alternate using Beauty of Joseon Retinal eye cream (on my whole face) and Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid. I've been alternating using The Ordinary Salicylic Acid &amp; The Ordinary Azelaic Acid as well. Then I moisturize with Soonjung 2x barrier cream\n\nI'm honestly at a loss for what kind of acne this even is. I'm sure its partially still hormonal? But also wondering if I have some fungal acne or demodex? My chin area is definitely the worst of it.\n\nI just re-ordered Cosrx cica-7 toner which I had stopped for a while but liked a lot, and ordered Differin to try once my retinal cream runs out. Any other advice GREATLY appreciated.",

      "content": "hi, im not an expert on skincare stuff but i do know a bit of basics after a bit of research, so pls go slowly on me ^^ this is a routine help and also a product request btw, so i have lots of questions\n\ni have broken skin barrier since probably i was a teen, i never know what it was cause i always have acne prone, sensitive, and combo skin so i thought its how that is. i just learned about it cause i recently have redness and dryness around my mouth either caused by eczema (which i have but never happened on face before) or perioral dermatitis. i just got avene cicafate like earlier today to repair it tho, maybe will also get lrps cicaplast to maintain afterwards.\n\nanyways im aware that repairing my skin barrier is quite simple, its just using gentle cleanser (cetaphil gentle cleanser), moisturizer for hydration (cerave moisturizing cream), and sunscreen for day (skin aqua uv brightening moisture gel). i will be adding cicafate after moisturizer and skin barrier will be expected to heal about 6 weeks. also gotta look for hydrating ingredients like ceramide and hyaluronic acid.\n\nnow my main questions r in the next sections so pls bear with me...\n\nafter repairing, i want to try healing my acne spots, acne scars, prevent acne and brighten uneven skintone. i decided to get salicylic, hyaluronic acids, and niacinamide, would it be too much to use them together everyday? if not, i probably won't be able to get them so soon anyways, im a student on a budget 😅 i also heard that its not good to use cicafate/cicaplast with acids, so how do i maintain the skin barrier? i saw someone said that they maintain by using cicafate as a sleep mask twice a week, would this work without using the acids on those nights or is there a better method? also after using cicafate/cicaplast for a long time, do i still continue using it to maintain or i can leave them if i can maintain my skin barrier properly?\n\ni do need recommendations for salicylic, hyaluronic acids, and niacinamide. the only ones ik about r the ones from the ordinary. i used anua peach niacinamide before a year ago but didnt see any improvements, now im not sure if i should give it a go again considering it may be blocked by my broken skin barrier. or maybe its 5% so its not stronge enough for me, if thats the case, should i try with the ordinary 10% niacinamide instead?\n\ni also need toner recommendations, rn im using simple soothing toner for awhile which is a very budget drugstore, got it purely cause i have no choice since im only allowed budget options but its obvious that i dont see any improvements from using it at all... so i really need a good budget option like less than usd20? i do have a few options i found may be good but im not confident:\n1. anua heartleaf soothing toner\n2. round lab dokdo toner\n3. anua rice toner\n4. skin1004 centella toner\n\nlastly, what would be the ideal routine after all these? this is what i wrote in my notes: cleanse, toner, salicylic acid (bha, not to use for repair skin barrier), hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, mask, moisturize, cicalfate (maintain as night use for overnight mask no moisturizer), and sunscreen.\n\n(btw i also have anua cleansing oil, tho i rarely use cause i dont wear makeup and dont see any improvements so idk if i should might as well continue using until finish)\n\nedit: forgot to add this, but i actually always rinse my face like once or twice during the day cause of my oily face, like around 1pm and 6pm. i always reapply moisturizer after that, do i also need to reapply sunscreen and cicafate too?",

I also got some dry skin under my beard and when I itch it starts to snow. \n\nI'm using CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser all over my face and trying to get under my beard onto the skin, the ordinary niacinamide and zinc serum on my nose and forehead, the T zone I presume, for the oily bits, and CeraVe pm moisturizing lotion at the end also tryna get under my beard. \n\nI'm currently only doing this at night but I also wanna add something to get rid of the black heads so I would like y'all's suggestions.

With products and styling, my hair is glossier, shiny-er, curlier, and more defined.\n4. Instead of looking great with a little refreshing, my hair will be a frizzy bush tomorrow and the days following, and will go up in a silicone curly tie and stay there until I feel up to (or be allowed to) take a shower and do my full routine \n5.

His little addiction is cute, but any variation of it makes my lips burn and I can barely kiss him when he has it on. I tried to stick it out in case it was just one but it’s all of them. \n\nSo given my skin is kind of sensitive anyway he asked if I’d find a new type because I’ll know what’s best for me and he wants me to use them all with him lol\n\nSo here I am on the search. Chapstick similar to Burt’s that won’t burn me\n\nThank you!!",
