At that time, I also was microneedling, but that has fallen out of my routine (fear of needles, youch).\n\n  \nI'd still catch photos of myself from behind and get self conscious about my large bald spot, so last January I started on a Fin + oral min dose and I feel like it helped me regrow a lot. I didn't really notice a lot of shedding then, and I'm really happy with the progress I've since. \n\n  \nJust wanted to share my success with you all.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Any antibiotic I can guarantee I've tried, creams, spironolactone - even accutane! It always comes back :/ \n\nWithin the past few months I feel like my acne has come back with a special vengeance and I have noticed an increasing amount on my jawline (which I haven't ever noticed before). I know that is typical of hormonal acne, which I even went to get my hormones checked and everything came back normal on that front too. Being almost in my 30s now, I am just praying to have clear skin for ONCE. I figured I would come ask you lovely people for any advice before I just accept that maybe this is just going to have to be my skin. \n\n  \nAM:\n\n\\- cleanse with water \n\n\\- Mineral sunscreen (current Ultra Violette Future Screen)\n\nPM:\n\n\\- Oil cleanse with Bioderma Sensibio Micellar Cleansing Oil\n\n\\- Youth To The People Superfood Cleanser\n\n\\- La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer\n\n\\- Trying to incorporate differen adapalene gel (recent addition) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ot6pe31hn8g1.jpg?width=1576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a356814d0de1b770e2ee99da238076e43bb91225\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13h3qd31hn8g1.jpg?width=1576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35f4035a8b5fb5e2d0a57445955960d8657dd894",

It’s my first time posting, I’ve included everything about my current routine + pictures and what I’m looking to fix. \n\nFor the last 6 months I’ve been washing my face at night with a prescribed Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% - Sulfur 5% cleanser, and following with Clindamycin Phosphate 1% lotion (and sometimes Cera Ve Daily Moisturizer if my face felt extra dry). This is just what the dermatologist prescribed, but I’m still left with lots of small bumps under my skin and the occasional larger whitehead. I change my pillowcase very regularly and am consistent about washing my face daily. I’ve included pictures below, the bumps aren’t too visible from far away but I can definitely see them in direct light and can feel them under my skin around my chin, cheeks, and forehead. \n\nI’m very new to all things skincare and I’m looking for any advice on what products I should keep or switch out if going back to the dermatologist isn’t an option for me. I’m looking to get rid of the texture in my skin and keep it hydrated without being oily. Thank you for any advice in advance! :)",

At the end of October/early November I had to take Plan B, it was the first time I’ve ever taken it - immediately I got a couple of breakouts, but I was also getting my period soon so I didn’t think much of it. but now it’s late December and I feel like my acne is at its worse. for reference, I have been on a consistent diet and a skin care routine, including taking 100 mg of spironolactone every day, my skin was at its best, so it’s very discouraging to be breaking out again after a year and a half of fully clear skin. does anyone have any experience in this? How long will it take for it to stop? Should I start using my tretinoin again on the affected areas? Any advice would be appreciated. I wish i had a before picture but i had stopped tracking my acne because its been good for so long",

      "content": "My wife was pregnant last year and developed severely dry and cracked hands. Our son is 9 months and hands have never improved. She used to put aquaphor on each night with gloves on throughout the night. And she puts on average moisturizing Cream. The aquaphor didn’t seem to help and just made her gloves thick with oil and was pain to clean. She then tried CeraVe with Vaseline at night with gloves, but didn’t work. Now she’s been using Renew Intensive Skin Therapy through the day with cerave periodically and then renew with Vaseline on top with gloves at night. She feels the renew helps a little but burns like lava when she puts it on and hasn’t made anything go away completely. I bought her some whipped beef tallow, which seems to be hit or miss online - so we will see. Another issue is she has an obsession with washing her hands which I know doesn’t help. She’s a nurse so feels like she has to wash her hands all the time. Is there any recommendations for her?",

Unlike the cleanser which I got from an actual store the moisturiser I ordered from Amazon and it was non-refundable so I've been using it for a month or two now. However, I've checked the ingredient list thoroughly and obviously although it doesn't have high concentration of good ingredients the normal Cosrx moisturiser would have, the ingredients aren't bad which is why I've just stuck with it and my skin has just stayed the same too\n\n**Concerns**\n\n* There are 2 areas where I get acne commonly which is my forehead and also that side of the cheek area you can see in the pics - **what do I do for that (I've just started with the adapalene+benzoyl peroxide gel)**\n* I also have alot of dark spots on my cheek sides from all those small comedones (might not be able to see in the pics) - **should I get a Vitamin C serum or a Niacinamide serum I gotta get one of those only.**\n* I also have a deep smile line on the right side of my cheek. I sleep on the left side so no idea how that's so deep other than because maybe when I smile, I smile to that side. **That cheek is sagging a bit (1st pic) - what do I do to firm the skin there?**",

      "content": "Hey friends\n\nBeen a while since I posted here. I'm 30m, and I have always had a full head of long hair. Never had any hair issues. Always grew quickly.\n\nAbout a year ago, my girlfriend was going through my hair and said I was thinning.\n\nShe took a picture and I was shocked. My vertex was completely bald. My hairline was fine, just my vertex was BALD bald. Freaked me OUT.\n\nSo I went out and bought topical minoxidil, and it has been a life-changer.\n\nI started on 2 doses of high-strength topical minoxidil a day, and it was awful. I never get headaches, but I was getting awful headaches.\n\nI cut it down to one dose a day, and I had no symptoms.\n\nA year later, boom, my hair is 100% back. Thick hair on my vertex, even a little bit of filling out of my hairline. I plan on staying on this topical forever. It's amazing and very cheap. Maybe $12 for a 3-month supply.\n\nSome background on fin.\n\nI actually have high testosterone. Maybe that contributes to my hair loss? Not sure, but through stress tests and exercise tests, I have very high exercise capacity. I'm a long-distance runner, and I love my high libido.\n\nI'm not some overcompensating dude bro, I'm just a real person with higher than normal T, high exercise tolerance, and very high libido.\n\nI've only ever been this way, and I do not want to take anything that would mess up my mood, exercise tolerance, and especially my sex life. Sex life is very important to me.\n\nSo hey, maybe in the future I'll dabble in finasteride, but for now, Min has brought my hair back to how it was in high school!\n\nEdit: what I mean to say, is that min works for me now. When it really starts to hit me hard, I’ll go bald.\n\nI’d rather fuck bald than risk not fucking with hair",

No spf currently and yes I know I need to wear it but it's been hard ok 😭 \nI have the la roche posay anthelios sunscreen. I was doing curology for a bit but haven't seen great results. It's tret clindamycin and azelaic acid. My skin does feel a lot softer after applying but I'm still getting blackheads and some pimples though not many. I sometimes apply Tatcha overnight repair after the curology, otherwise I use the curology gel moisturizer.

Mainly I am looking for nail strengthening tips, but anything is welcome.\n\nI have been a terrible nail biter for as long as I can remember and in the last year or so I have broken this habit. Now I really want to grow my nails out because I don’t like how my fingers look with such short nails, but it’s hard because my nails are so weak. My thumbnails seem to be the strongest and break the least.. but I spend so long growing them out just to break one and have to trim them all the way down again. I currently have some “B-Pure” cuticle oil/ nail strengthener that I use almost daily, but don’t think it’s doing much more than some hydrating. Which I didn’t have the highest hopes for it since I got it at the Dollar Tree. \n\nI don’t have a lot of money so cheaper reccomendations are appreciated.. And thank you in advance :)",

Benzoyl peroxide gel – He told me to apply it daily in the morning on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer.\n(He didn’t suggest any moisturizer; I’m using the Minimalist Vitamin B5 moisturizer)\n\n2. Tretinoin gel 0.025% – He told me to apply this in the evening around 6–7 pm on the affected areas for 1 hour, then wash my face and apply a moisturizer.\n\n3. Vitamin C serum – He told me to apply this at night after washing my face (he didn’t mention applying a moisturizer after it)\n\n4. He also gave me tablets, which I have to take once daily for 30 days\n\nToday is my second day of following this routine, and my skin feels itchy, looks reddish and I’m noticing more acne/bumps.\n\nIs this normal?

Currently washing once a week, and applying the gel and smoothie everyday to style my curls but my hair normally looks like the picture attached on a normal no product day. Are there products out there that will help me with this? Feel like my hair is entirely reliant on products and I am not sure what to do.\n\nMy routine is current:\n\nSheaMoisture Shampoo (coconut and hibiscus)once a week and co wash everyday.\n\nI pat my hair to get excess water off.\n\nI use about a quarter sized amount of SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie followed by a quarter sized amount of Curling gel. Both of these products i just rake through my hair with my fingers. At the end of the day I will do wash everything out and pat dry once again before going to bed. I use a satin pillow case\n\nPS The second picture is what my hair looks like after showering before any products \n\nI’d appreciate any advice!",
