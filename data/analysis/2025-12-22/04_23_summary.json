At that time, I also was microneedling, but that has fallen out of my routine (fear of needles, youch).\n\n  \nI'd still catch photos of myself from behind and get self conscious about my large bald spot, so last January I started on a Fin + oral min dose and I feel like it helped me regrow a lot. I didn't really notice a lot of shedding then, and I'm really happy with the progress I've since. \n\n  \nJust wanted to share my success with you all.

How long will it take for it to stop? Should I start using my tretinoin again on the affected areas? Any advice would be appreciated.

I had a terrible habit of popping/picking at them, which led to this massive cluster of PIH/PIE(?).\n\nThe active acne is finally under control. I’ve been using Differin (Adapalene 0.1%) nightly and Azelaic Acid for months. While I’m not getting new breakouts anymore, the marks themselves haven't faded at all.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

If all else fails, I’ll use it on something I purchase at Ulta frequently, but I also think this may be a good opportunity to branch out and buy something that I may not always think to buy for myself. I don’t wear a ton of makeup and the makeup I do wear I do the same basically every day, so I’m thinking more along the lines of skincare or hair care or other self-care things. Is there anything along those lines I could purchase at Ulta that you swear by? I’m particularly interested in recommendations of things such as face/hair masks and products to help my skin texture (I have mostly clear skin but my forehead texture is a bit rough and could use some clarifying) and some face/undereye puffiness (I’m a teacher so I def don’t get enough sleep haha), but any recommendations are welcome!

      "content": "(pics are after showering and moisturizing) I have struggled with acne all my life. For about 8-9 years I was on hormonal BC and Spironolactone which kept my skin pretty clear. For personal reasons I stopped this combo and would prefer to avoid starting it again if possible. I also used to be on 0.05% Tretinoin but my skin started having adverse reactions so I went down to a gentler retinoid. I stopped the aforementioned medications over a year ago and my skin was mostly fine until a few months ago, and it has looked like the pics ever since.\n\nI was using a lot of Korean skincare but have cut down a lot on products to try different things and simplify my routine but nothing seems to be helping much.\n\nI double cleanse with Cerave oil cleanser &amp; hydrating water cleanser. I alternate using Beauty of Joseon Retinal eye cream (on my whole face) and Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid. I've been alternating using The Ordinary Salicylic Acid &amp; The Ordinary Azelaic Acid as well. Then I moisturize with Soonjung 2x barrier cream\n\nI'm honestly at a loss for what kind of acne this even is. I'm sure its partially still hormonal? But also wondering if I have some fungal acne or demodex? My chin area is definitely the worst of it.\n\nI just re-ordered Cosrx cica-7 toner which I had stopped for a while but liked a lot, and ordered Differin to try once my retinal cream runs out. Any other advice GREATLY appreciated.",

It likes to go in little ringlets at the end, but the base is super heavy and wavy.\n\nCurrently i use a moisturizing hair mask for the main section of my hair (scalp and length) and then a revitalizing leave in conditioner on the ends and lower section then wrap in a silk wrap.\n\nI leave that for a night with my hair in a bun after washing, then in the morning i use a mousse on the scalp and hair rubbing that in and finger separating, then a gel thing i was recommended that helps it coil up. Then i just towel dry and leave it the rest of the day\n\nI feel like this is too much product for my hair, even if it was minimal use. It stays looking super wet and i think my hair gets too heavy to get its nice waves. If i dont use any product its just fluffy and frizzy. I also dont really like how the gel feels and how my hair feels afterward.\n\nAny recommendations for products, styles, things that can help get the nicer waves/curls? I used to have them as a kid, but ive killed my hair and have just been regrowing it for about 3-4 years. Its been about 2 years since my last haircut.\n\nThank you!!! I have really really thick hair thats hard to layer so id love any help or reccs.\n\nThis was after a full day xmas party too, so even after HOURS in dry air it still doesnt look dry. Just oily. My scalp normally also isnt oily and my hair needs to be washed every 2 days or it gets dry instead of every day.\n\nSorry for the bad camera quality.",

Mainly I am looking for nail strengthening tips, but anything is welcome.\n\nI have been a terrible nail biter for as long as I can remember and in the last year or so I have broken this habit. Now I really want to grow my nails out because I don’t like how my fingers look with such short nails, but it’s hard because my nails are so weak. My thumbnails seem to be the strongest and break the least.. but I spend so long growing them out just to break one and have to trim them all the way down again. I currently have some “B-Pure” cuticle oil/ nail strengthener that I use almost daily, but don’t think it’s doing much more than some hydrating. Which I didn’t have the highest hopes for it since I got it at the Dollar Tree. \n\nI don’t have a lot of money so cheaper reccomendations are appreciated.. And thank you in advance :)",

      "content": "My wife was pregnant last year and developed severely dry and cracked hands. Our son is 9 months and hands have never improved. She used to put aquaphor on each night with gloves on throughout the night. And she puts on average moisturizing Cream. The aquaphor didn’t seem to help and just made her gloves thick with oil and was pain to clean. She then tried CeraVe with Vaseline at night with gloves, but didn’t work. Now she’s been using Renew Intensive Skin Therapy through the day with cerave periodically and then renew with Vaseline on top with gloves at night. She feels the renew helps a little but burns like lava when she puts it on and hasn’t made anything go away completely. I bought her some whipped beef tallow, which seems to be hit or miss online - so we will see. Another issue is she has an obsession with washing her hands which I know doesn’t help. She’s a nurse so feels like she has to wash her hands all the time. Is there any recommendations for her?",

      "content": "Hey friends\n\nBeen a while since I posted here. I'm 30m, and I have always had a full head of long hair. Never had any hair issues. Always grew quickly.\n\nAbout a year ago, my girlfriend was going through my hair and said I was thinning.\n\nShe took a picture and I was shocked. My vertex was completely bald. My hairline was fine, just my vertex was BALD bald. Freaked me OUT.\n\nSo I went out and bought topical minoxidil, and it has been a life-changer.\n\nI started on 2 doses of high-strength topical minoxidil a day, and it was awful. I never get headaches, but I was getting awful headaches.\n\nI cut it down to one dose a day, and I had no symptoms.\n\nA year later, boom, my hair is 100% back. Thick hair on my vertex, even a little bit of filling out of my hairline. I plan on staying on this topical forever. It's amazing and very cheap. Maybe $12 for a 3-month supply.\n\nSome background on fin.\n\nI actually have high testosterone. Maybe that contributes to my hair loss? Not sure, but through stress tests and exercise tests, I have very high exercise capacity. I'm a long-distance runner, and I love my high libido.\n\nI'm not some overcompensating dude bro, I'm just a real person with higher than normal T, high exercise tolerance, and very high libido.\n\nI've only ever been this way, and I do not want to take anything that would mess up my mood, exercise tolerance, and especially my sex life. Sex life is very important to me.\n\nSo hey, maybe in the future I'll dabble in finasteride, but for now, Min has brought my hair back to how it was in high school!\n\nEdit: what I mean to say, is that min works for me now. When it really starts to hit me hard, I’ll go bald.\n\nI’d rather fuck bald than risk not fucking with hair",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

It didn’t help with tanning, at all, even with reapplication throughour the day. \n\nPlease suggest some good reccos for dry, acne prone sensitive skin, even if they’re Pharmacy sunscreens, I’d love to go for them, in fact, I think I’d be able to trust it more.
