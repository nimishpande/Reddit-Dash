      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I recently learned that silk-lined beanies exist, and I’m wondering if they actually help with curls or if they’re just another trend. Anyone with 2c–3c hair tried them and noticed a difference? Do they reduce frizz and keep definition better than regular hats? I’d really like to hear real experiences before buying one. For routine context, I use Treecell Moisture Rich shampoo and conditioner, Cantu Curl Activator and Eco Style Olive Gel, and I diffuse my hair on low to medium heat. I sleep on a satin pillowcase.",

I just can’t get through a day without my hair at least half up to be out of my face and last time I got my hair cut, my stylist said that I do have a good bit of physical damage and no heat or chemical damage. Are there any protective hairstyles or better products I can do/use instead? It gets to a point that my buns and ponytails have a massive about of tiny hairs sticking out and I don’t wanna keep ruining my hair, but I don’t know what to really do about it. Pics of hair up vs down for reference on hair type and curl pattern on different parts of my head lol. \n\nRoutine: California Naturals shampoo and conditioner, comb conditioner and let sit before rinsing. Harmonize Beauty leave in. Micro plop. Olaplex 10 gel (or CurlSmith bouncy strength mousse, if I don’t feel like gel). Diffuse. Olaplex 7 oil. (I do only use olaplex because I was sent the full size products in a Curls Monthly subscription, otherwise I can’t afford them lol). ",

Any suggestions on how to improve my skins texture, hydration and overall life? \n\nRoutine: \nI’m using dermalogica daily exfoliate with Luke warm water at nights and just rinse with water in the morning, toner is the innisfree hyaluronic acid toner, topped with sometimes both cetaphil moisturizer and my skinfix moisturizer on top. The last few days I’ve felt that my skin was irritated just by using the toner and moisturizer so I had to wash it off gently and use my Vaseline cocoa moisturizer just to calm it \n\nI use sunscreen daily (a Korean skincare brand I’m blanking on) \n\nI changed my MAC foundation from the matte formula to the non matte but anytime I use setting powder (or even when I don’t) you can see just how flakey and dehydrated my skin is - it’s gross and looks so bad. \n\nI avoid super hot showers, drink 3-5 glasses of water if not more when working out and don’t use rough towels on my face. \n\nAny guidance?

I’m doing the sandwich method and using it only 2–3 nights a week.\n\nHere’s the weird part:\nMy right side is healing beautifully\nBut my left cheek suddenly got 2–3 new inflamed bumps\n\nIs this normal?? Is it purging even if it’s happening on just one side of my face?\n\nFor context: this left cheek is where the hydroquinone damaged my barrier the most, and where I had the earlier breakouts.
