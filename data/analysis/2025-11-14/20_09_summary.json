      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Somewhere during that time I started using adapalene and then a year later transitioned to tretinoin. They did wonders for my skin for a while, but eventually I overused and destroyed my skin barrier. My skin was always super raw and every morning I would discover new little red bumps and tiny pustules that would pop super easily. Fast forward to now, for 1.5 months I’ve cut back on all actives and only cleanse, moisturize and spf. This week I slowly reintroduced azelaic acid back in only 2-3x. My skin feels stronger and isn’t as raw anymore but these bumps still appear all over my face almost every morning, mostly on my cheeks and temples. No changes to my diet or lifestyle (I’ve always prioritized eating healthy and exercising). I sleep with my hair in a bonnet and wash my sheets regularly. I’m also ocd about never letting anything touch my face. I’m exhausted trying to figure out what’s going on. Pls help!\n\nMy routine:\n- Aestura atobarrier365 cleanser\n- DDG red light mask\n- Aestura atobarrier365 cream mist\n- S.nature squalane moisturizer\n- AM only: Innisfree daily uv defense sunscreen (blue one)\n- PM 2-3x/wk: Shani Darden azelaic rescue serum before moisturizer",

      "content": "Hi, I have 3a-3b hair and almost a month ago I decided I needed to start taking care of it properly and stop only using one product every single morning. I was excited to start taking care of my hair, but I’ve had the hardest time managing it. I have a horrible problem with frizz and I’m truly at a loss on how to handle it. I feel like I’ve tried everything and I have a million bajillion product attempts, but nothing has given me any sort of progress. I’ve followed hair routines that are similar to my hair type and porosity type, I’ve bought Camille Rose shampoo and conditioner that are supposed to mend frizz, I tried Not Your Mothers Sculpting gel and after that didn’t work I tried the same brands Flash Freeze gel. I’ve also tried using Not Your Mothers mousse- that didn’t work so I tried Doux’s mousse, but I still had frizz. I have tried SO. MANY. CURL. CREAMS. I’ve tried Rizo’s, Not Your Mothers, LUS, everything I could find; the only one that showed clear signs of decreased frizz was Rizo’s, but there’s still frizz galore. I’ve even been spending a good 3 hours after wash and routine day diffusing my hair with cold air. I’m not sure if it’s the way I’m applying products or the order I rake them in?\n\nMy routine right now consists of:\n\nSoaking wet hair washed by Camille Rose shampoo and conditioner, then I section and spray Not Your Mothers leave conditioner. I then rake in Rizo’s curl defining cream followed by Doux’s texture foam enhancer. After that I take a styling brush and brush out each section. Finally, I use Not Your Mothers flash freeze gel and I scrunch each section and then I diffuse on the coldest setting and allow a gel cast to form. (I’m not sure if this helps, but I have a medium hair strand, it’s not super think, but a strand is noticeable between my fingers and is far from thin.)\n\nAfter the routine, sometimes my curls with separate from each other and I’ll have really small strings of curls that look super weird. The shape and frizz-less curls will usually last the day, but once I’m home from school, my hair is ridiculously frizzy and it won’t last make it another day. I am truly at a loss and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Any advice is super welcomed. I’ve never dyed my hair or had any treatments done, my hair is completely virgin- not sure if that information makes a difference.\n\nI never realized how difficult curly hair can be.",

I need hydration, but not pore clogging. My acne is around my mouth, on my cheeks, and a few spots on my forehead occasionally. I’ve tried the recommended actives (Salicylic acid, glycolic acid, hypochlorous acid, benzoyl peroxide) and they WRECK my skin. \n\nCurrent routine-\n- 1st cleanse (only if I’m wearing makeup)- MadHippie cleansing oil\n- 2nd cleanse (only cleanse in AM &amp; PM if wearing no makeup)- dermae pure biome balancing cleanser \n- If I’m going to apply makeup- topicals clearly clarifying and calming mist \n- Moisturizer- vanicream\n- SPF - eltamd uv clear\n\n\n1. Makeup remover//first cleanse- the wipes burn my face VERY badly. Im trying an oil cleanser but it’s a lot of work and I think it’s clogging my pores. I’m not opposed to an oil cleanser, but what brands/types of makeup removers won’t leave my pores clogged?\n\n2. Something to calm the acne- the topicals spray works great for temporary calming, but I’ve seen no long term results. It also dries my face out so bad it’s almost not even worth using. What can I use to manage my breakouts that won’t wreck my barrier or irritate my skin?\n\n 3. Moisturizer- I’ve been using vanicream for years but lately it hasn’t felt the same. my skin soaks the vanicream up in about 45 seconds &amp; it burns SO BAD. it also smells like alcohol (as of recently, I’ve never noticed it before). What is an acne friendly moisturizer I can use that won’t clog my pores/break me out, but that can also fix my skin barrier because clearly it’s messed up😂\n\nThank u in advance!!!!",

Skin is also sensitive and acne prone. I am starting to get some sagging in my lower cheeks and one side of my face is drooping more than the other. I have chubby cheeks and want definition in my jaw, chin, neck, and cheekbones. I’ve seen so many options online, and just don’t know what to choose! A lot of them are way too expensive for me too, but I am willing to spend a few hundred on each device, if the results are promising.\n\nI’m just struggling pretty badly with my self-confidence due to this and would appreciate any recommendations y’all have.\n\nRecommendations for skincare, supplement, techniques, etc. are also welcome!!

I always thought Cetaphil was the safest product for my face because of its reputation for being good for sensitive skin. But recently, after showering, I applied the moisturizer and suddenly felt a burning sensation on my jaw and chin — only in those areas, which was really strange.\n\nAfter that, I broke out, but only on the parts that burned. The acne wasn’t the usual closed kind; they were smallest white bumps that popped easily, and the type that multiplies a lot. This has never happened before with Cetaphil, but suddenly it burned me out of nowhere.\n\nI’m really confused and kind of scared to use it again. Has anyone experienced something like this? It’s frustrating because this was the only moisturizer I trusted for my dry skin, and now I have no idea what to use.",

      "title": "So, I tried out DIY Amla, Reetha, and Shikakai Shampoo (and a DIY Conditioner Too!)",
      "content": "I tried making my own shampoo at home.  \nAfter moving, we realised the water here is Hard, and was causing lumps and chunks of hairfall. Like, within 3 months, my hair was halved.\n\nNow, I have low-porosity strands and shoulder-length hair. Plus, I learnt it the hard way not to apply heavy oils and protein-rich products that weigh hair down. Moreover, my shampoo + Hard water were not helping.  \nSo, I decided to get the three ingredients and try making my own!\n\n# My Hair Pack\n\nI also make a monthly hair pack with\n\n* Cloves (Just 2. The hair pack lasts a week in powdered form)\n* Fenugreek\n* Kalonji\n* Rosemary (dried), and\n* Curry leaves\n\nI have been using this combo since 2024, and it has been great. Just needed to dial down on the cloves count xD\n\n# Shampoo Curation\n\nNow, the shampoo curation procedure is 2 hours. You heat it for 30 minutes, let it cool a little and then squish out the shampoo through a strainer.  \nThat is excluding the overnight soak in hot water. The result was pretty foamy with water. I did not add any essential oils. And I did soak dried hibiscus petals alongside the three ingredients overnight. For the colour, really.\n\n# Shampoo Usage\n\nI noticed that using water from our drinking water filter was the way to go. So I took a bucket for the shampoo day. The shampoo itself had foam, but did not foam up more as I massaged it into my scalp. I did feel my strands drying up quickly, almost hay-like.  \nSome videos say to add regular Paraben and SLS-free shampoo to it, but I wanted to try the real deal once. After washing it off, my hair felt like needles for a solid minute.\n\n# DIY Conditioner Curation and Usage\n\nAdditionally, I made a conditioner with\n\n* Fenugreek\n* Flaxseed\n* Vitamin E oil\n* Sweet Almond Oil\n* Lil bit of glycerine\n\nI soaked the seed and the fenugreek the night before and let it bloom. Now, this conditioner has no preservative, so I used it all up in one go. I kept it for 30 minutes under a shower cap and washed it off.\n\n# Result\n\n**Day 1**: My Hair felt like a gourmet meal for cows. So dry, so hard to touch  \n**Day 2**: My hair suddenly softened up and felt full to the touch. Hairfall was there, but much less.  \n**Day 3** and onwards: Hair feels full, the raw ingredients' smell is gone, and it still feels soft. Hairfall again, is there. But little bit less than the last few months.\n\nWould I want to make this again? Sure. It had a very different result than whatever I had anticipated (my entire hair volume falling off with the shampoo wash).\n\nBut can I do this weekly? Probably not. 2 hours for shampoo curation, and another hour for the conditioner. Plus, take an extra hour for the cleanup routine. I think this works well as a bi-weekly shampoo if you are preparing it on your own.\n\n# Does it work?\n\nI wish to use it again after another week to see how it goes. Hoping for the best. Thanks for reading! &lt;3",
