      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "title": "[Routine Help] 45yo in a tropical country, getting wrinkles, please advise on my 1st ever skin care routine",
      "content": "I have never had a skin care routine before now, and have cobbled this together over the last 3 months based almost exclusively on conversations with ChatGPT. It started out with a doctor prescribing tretinoin, and spiralled quickly from there\n\nI thought I would submit my routine to this excellent community to solicit wisdom. Unlike AI you are actual humans with actual faces of your own. Keep in mind that I probably don't even know how to apply many of these products properly (I still don't know where exactly the eye cream is to go: not on the lid?!) so any tips however basic are welcome\n\nMe: 45yo white man from a northern climate (Canada) now living in a humid tropical place (Singapore). Starting to get wrinkles and aging noticeably\n\n  \nHere is my current daily skin care routine.\n\n\n\n**AM (in photo, from left to right)**\n\n**1. ⁠Cleanse.** Allies of Skin Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser. Previously used Malin &amp; Goetz Grape Fruit Face Cleanser, but came to find it much to harsh. This product is much softer and nicer. You can strangely apply it to a nearly dry face and leave it on for a bit before washing off. Leaves face clean and soft.\n\n**2. ⁠Shave.** Aesop Moroccan Neroli Shaving Serum. I only shave 2-4 times per week. I have experimented with shaving before or after cleanse, and found this order works best.\n\n**3. ⁠Spot Exfoliate.** Paula's Choice 2% BHA Gel. I do not do this step every day, and rarely go outside the \"T-Zone\". I have a propensity to have large pores, so this helps loosen them up. Good on neck &amp; shoulders too where I occasionally have acne.\n\n**4. ⁠Antioxidant.** SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic Serum. I have read that this is the hero product on which SkinCeuticals was founded and that kicked off the whole antioxidant product category. Vitamin C continues to be the most clinically proven treatment (along with retinols) and this was the first formulation that suspended it in a stable delivery vehicle. The patent recently expired, so I am curious about less costly copycat products. Some competitors claim to be more stable; for example, Drunk Elephant looks good, and half the price?\n\n**5. ⁠Eye Cream.** SkinBetter Science InterFuse Treatment Cream EYE. I dunno, ChatGPT just said this was the best one to get based on ingredients and reviews.\n\n**6. ⁠Moisturizer.** SkinCeuticals Metacell Renewal B3. I really like this product. Goes on nicely and isn't occlusive, which was a problem when I was using SC 242 (below) during the daytime in such a hot and humid climate.\n\n**7. Sunscreen.** La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Oil Control Gel-Cream. Redditors in North America may not know this product, as the laws are strict, and for decades have barred all these amazing chemical sunscreens. (Europe and Asia have dramatically lower rates of skin cancer as a result. Such an insane policy, but that's another story.) This specific one has the mighty &amp; unmatched UVMUNE 400 UVA blocker and is factored in this nice oil-control formula which is perfect for me.\n\n\n\n**PM (not in photo)**\n\n**1. ⁠Cleanse.** AoS Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser again.\n\n**2. ⁠⁠Treatment.** Prescription Tretinoin 0.025% cream. This is the lowest dose you can be prescribed, but it is apparently much more powerful than all over-the-counter retinols. It is  nice to have a step in my routine that costs $22 instead of the high prices of some of these products. You don't want to know how much the next step costs.\n\n**3. Moisturizer.** SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore 242 Anti Aging Moisturiser. This is the highest recommended pairing for use with tretinoin. Very nice product to use at night, but not during daytime in a humid climate like Singapore.\n\n\n\nAnything else? I have a product from Grown Alchemist called Skin Renewal Mask which I like and use occasionally. I am not sure it is best in class though. I think I could up my game here with a serious clay mask plus a different hydrating mask. Would love any recommendations for either. (ChatGPT suggests Sisley for clay, and something from SkinCeuticals for hydrating. I'm not in a hurry as I still have this GA mask and am getting through it slowly.)\n\nOK that's it I think! Any feedback very welcome. I'd prefer to just stop aging entirely please if you can tell me how to do that.",

Third photo is last week. \n\nTo start, I walked into the salon yesterday with my hair curly. Typically I’ve walked in with my hair up, curls not visible. The stylist who I’ve seen for 10 years, who typically just gives me a blunt cut that allows me to wear my hair both curly and blown out, takes a look at my curls and says “oh! I love your natural hair. Are you wearing it like this now?” I say yes, that I haven’t blown it out in over a year. \n\nShe says she wants to cut my hair dry and give me layers. I tell her very strongly that I don’t think this will look good because my hair is very very fine and I don’t have a ton of density. I tell her that if she does layers it will look straggly and thin at the bottom. She says “trust me!” I say ok. \n\nAfter she cuts it dry, she washes it. She then tells me that I can either diffuse my own hair in the chair myself (she asks me if I typically diffuse at home. I say no, I let my hair air dry almost always) or she can diffuse it for me. I kind of look at her horrified and stunned because she has been towel drying my hair (😭🤯) and is attempting to put styling products in my towel dried hair. I tell her, ummmm well I always put styling products on dripping wet hair. She doesn’t do or say anything, almost like she hasn’t heard me. She then takes the diffuser and starts tossling my hair with one hand and diffusing it with another (wtf!!!). \n\nI sit there silently horrified. It looks so incredibly awful, like a drowned rat that has lost most of its fur. She then turns to me and keeps saying how great it is. I know she’s lying. She then charges me $150 (not with tip). I cannot believe she let me walk through the salon, telling me how great it looked, charged me as if everything was normal and ok. I’m so mad I don’t even know what to do. Also, she cut it in a way that won’t look good blown out, so I can’t even wear it that way now. ",

Last september I added 1x 0.5mg dut to my 7x 1mg fin regimen. I even improved my hair thickness for 6 months. BUT I started to shed after the end of this 6 month.\n\nIn march 2025 I started to shed like crazy… This shed lasted until today, and still going. I tried to increase my dut dosage up to x2 and x3 with x7 fin per week but nothing changed.\n\nTo clarify, I do not use generic brands. Only propecia and avodart.\n\nSo, the question rises now: What should I do?\n\nA) Stop dutasteride fully because it gives damage (?) to my hair and only stick with finasteride. 9 month is already enough.\n\nB) 2-3x dut is not enough so increase it to ED.\n\nFor the option A, I do find it weird to be honest because some people say that I might not be responding enough to dut But dont forget, I have never stopped using 7x fin.\n\nCould you guys help me, or just share your ideas please? I am planning to see a doctor but they are generally useless since they are mainly not pro fin/dut in my country.\n\nI appreciate all the help and comments",

      "content": "So I noticed something is different from previous years and I'm not sure what is causing this issue all of a sudden, so I'm hoping I can get some advice. Last year my hair was long, past my shoulders at least and this year it's been shorter above my shoulders. I've noticed lately that after washing my hair, the hair closest to the scalp starts to look a bit oily looking after 1-2 days. And now that it's colder outside I wear a hat to work and my hair ends up looking  pretty similar at the end of the day, maybe a bit more oily looking even if I washed it not too long ago. I don't remember my hair being this bad previous years when it was longer, unless it being shorter isn't helping?\n\nI usually wash my hair once a week and use dry shampoo in between if needed, but maybe I've been pushing it a little over a week as to not fade hair color faster (even though it's dyed brown ontop of the faded red I had before). Lately I've been using a homemade dry shampoo as it's unscented (I don't want scented dry shampoo, especially if it's feminine smelling), lasts longer, and is cheaper. Before it was a mixture of baking soda and corn starch, but for a little bit I've just been having the mixture be corn starch. Not sure if that would make a difference or not though. Been using dry shampoo a bit more often than before though because it's been looking oily sooner than previous years.\n\nWhen I do wash my hair, I do the same routine as I've done in the past. I use the product Frizz ease on the top of my head since my hair gets frizzy, and I blow dry it and style it a bit with a heated tool.\n\nI've never had really oily skin and my scalp/forehead doesn't look shiny or anything. It's really a minor amount it seems like but my hair makes it look like it's worse than what it is. Having dyed hair, I thought it could be a reason as my hair would be porous, but by my roots (where it's oily looking) is my actual natural hair. I've been washing my hair with The Earthling Co. shampoo and conditioner bars and my hair does feel good, smooth, and soft afterwards so I don't think that could be a reason? I've been using them way before this issue too.\n\nIf there's any other information I can provide that could help, feel free to ask! Otherwise is there anything extra I should do to help with this issue, and to make my hair look cleaner longer like it used to? Especially after wearing a hat at work... as I don't really want to have to wash it more often either. Thank you!",

Posting on behalf of my aunt and her son who is a 9th grader and white. \n\nHe has extremely coily hair, somewhere in the 4s, and has been growing it out in what the kids call a broccoli style lol. It’s gotten very long, hard to maintain, matted, and dry. He really doesn’t let anyone help him much with taking care of it (teenagers are stubborn of course) so his mom is trying to help him manage it but not having much success. Now he wants to get box braids. Obviously his mom is unsure about that because she doesn’t want to appropriate Black culture.\n\nMy immediate thought was yes, it seems problematic, but it also seems like there has to be some style that would work for him that isn’t just how it naturally grows and lays on his head. Is this problematic? Are there any styles in particular that would be more or less offensive to wear? \n\nI am unfortunately not sure on his current hair routine. I know his mom tries to shampoo and condition it and detangle it - not too often, but even then he doesn’t allow her to do it very long if at all. I’m not sure what products he puts in post-wash, either. :( So sorry, mods!\n\nThank you so much 🫶🏻",

I’ve done research before, and watched videos, but I’m still not sure if I’ve found the right products. I wash my hair two times a week, and I use a diffuser to dry slightly. \n\nShower routine: SheaMoisture Shine and Curl Shampoo, SheaMoisture Deep Moisturizing Conditioner. Then two times a month I use SM Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment and SM Raw Shea Butter Deep Treatment Masque.\n\nOut of the shower routine: SM Curl Smoothie, Design Essentials Almond &amp; Avocado Curl Enhancing Mousse, Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Sculpting Gel (just a little), and then finish off with grapeseed oil. \n\nIdk if these products are too heavy for my hair or what. Please help! Also side note, I can’t cut my hair anymore because of my faith. Thanks all in advance! :)\n",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I wanted to get a second opinion from the community regarding some advice my dermatologist recently gave me. I’m not trying to discredit her — I actually agree with some of her recommendations — but a few things she said don’t seem to line up with the research I’ve been able to find, so I’d appreciate hearing what others think.\n\n**My previous treatment:**\n\n* Finasteride 1 mg daily\n* Oral minoxidil 2.5 mg daily\n\n**What she recommended switching to:**\n\n* Dutasteride 0.5 mg\n* Oral minoxidil 5 mg\n* Both taken **Monday to Friday only** (weekends off), and possibly reducing to **just 3 days per week** in the future\n\nI actually *agree* with the switch to dutasteride + higher-dose minoxidil. I’ve seen a lot of people report better results with this combo, especially if they didn’t respond strongly to finasteride.\n\nHowever, some of what she said really threw me off:\n\n# 1. She said finasteride “stops working after one year.”\n\nI haven’t found *any* study supporting that claim. Everything I’ve read suggests the opposite — that finasteride maintains or improves results beyond year one, with long-term stability for many users. If anyone has seen research that supports her statement, please let me know.\n\n# 2. She told me to take dutasteride + minoxidil only Monday to Friday, and maybe reduce to 3 days/week eventually.\n\nThis is where I’m most confused. Everything I’ve read about *oral minoxidil* suggests it should be **taken daily**, since missing days can reduce its effect due to its short half-life. Dutasteride I could understand less frequent dosing, but minoxidil seems like it needs consistent daily administration.  \nIf anyone has experience with intermittent dosing, or knows why a doctor would recommend it, I’d love to hear it.\n\n# 3. She recommended mesotherapy.\n\nI know some people swear by it, but the clinical evidence looks mixed. I’m not necessarily against it — just unsure whether it’s worth doing, and whether it adds anything on top of dutasteride + oral minoxidil.\n\n\n\nSo basically:  \n**I like the medication switch she proposed, but I’m unsure about her claims regarding finasteride losing effectiveness and minoxidil not needing daily dosing.**  \nIf anyone in the community — especially those using oral minoxidil or dutasteride — could share their experience or any evidence, I’d appreciate it.",
