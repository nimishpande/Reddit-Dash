      "content": "This is my first time posting on here but I thought it would be fun to share my hair growth in one year. I personally struggled my entire life with growing my hair to my mermaid dreams, and its finally happening. I have NEVER been someone who says \"My hair grows really fast,\" but now I can see actual progress, when before, my hair would literally never grow beyond my shoulders (when curly). My hair journey is as follows\n\nMiddle school: Str\\*\\*tened my hair several times per week :(\n\nHigh School: Realized how damaged my hair was and dove headfirst into the Curly Girl method. This was not the way FOR ME, personally. I did this throughout college. My scalp was SCREAMING. I also had bad brushing habits and my hair was constantly dry. BUT, it was cute, and my curl pattern came back. I was doing crazy shit you guys. I was putting eggs and avocado on my head. I was dry detangling my hair for an hour with my fingers. I was using all natural shampoos that had the washing power of candle wax. These were not the days.\n\nPost College: Gave up on my dreams. I started using Head and Shoulders, all of the sulfates and silicones (go figure) and kept it basically all drugstore.\n\nEarly 2025: Discovered the Abbey Yung method... and I gotta say... it makes sense.\n\nI just want to say I know that hair is different for everyone, but leaving the CGM did wonders for my hair growth and health. I thought that Head and Shoulders would dry my hair out, but I have quickly discovered that with the right level of conditioning and oils, all of my hair is happier than ever.\n\nCurrent Routine:\n\nUsually a pre oil treatment or Olaplex 3 (K18 after a tax return though, you feel me??)\n\nHead and shoulders (never 2-in-1, though wondering if I should try it for extra conditioning) rinse and repeat. Usually leave on for a few minutes to let the medication settle in.\n\nConditioner: Matrix Food for Soft OR Dove 10-in-1 serum Bond Strength Mask\n\nLeave in: Usually Miss Jessie's Leave-In Condish (the best!) Currently trying Redken ABC. Had high hopes, but it's not thick enough for my hair and doesn't give me the best detangling experience.\n\nCurl Cream: Trying Curls Don't Lie by Isima. Its not a 10/10 but its pretty good!\n\nAir dry: always, because I find it easier.\n\nOil: my lengths with MoroccanOil or OGx Coconut Miracle Oil every other day-ish, depending on literally nothing except what's easier to reach for in my cabinet.\n\nI don't refresh other than oil, I just let it go and look a bit frizzy. Less is more for me\n\n  \nIf you've read this far, what product surprised you or helped you tremendously in reaching your hair goals?? xoxo ",

      "content": " \nI was using minimalist and plum sunscreens last year and they just felt very sticky, greasy or just uncomfortable out in the sun. But this sunscoop actually feels like a proper body lotion that just happens to have SPF 50+ PA++++ in it. Like i just get out of the shower, pump it out like a normal body lotion which acts as a sunscreen too 😭\n\n**Texture and feel**\nVery smooth lotion texture. Not runny, not thick and spreads easily and absorbs pretty fast. After it settles, it doesn’t feel heavy or oily. My skin just feels normal and soft. I can get dressed in a few minutes without that sticky sunscreen feeling.\n\nIt’s SPF 50+ PA++++ with broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection. I’ve worn it out in proper sun and didn’t notice tanning or redness. \n\n**Ingredients I liked**\nWhat makes it better than basic sunscreens is the added skincare.\n5 percent Niacinamide to help with pigmentation and even skin tone.\nIt has 5 Essential Ceramides too.\n\n**Full ingredient list on the bottle:**\nPurified Water, Octocrylene, Niacinamide, Octyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Trehalose, Methylene Bis Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Avena Sativa Oat Kernel Extract, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Aloe Vera Extract, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Propanediol, 1,2 Hexanediol, Hexyldecanol, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Ceramide AS, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide NG, Sodium Acrylate Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, C15 19 Alkane, Fragrance, Sodium Polyacrylate, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer 6, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium EDTA, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum.\n\nIt’s also free from Benzophenone, Formaldehyde &amp; Oxybenzone, atleast that's what the bottle says.\n\n**Hydration**\nIt actually feels moisturizing. I’ve skipped my regular body lotion a few times and this alone was enough. No dryness, no tightness.\n\nI do not write such long reviews but i am fr in love with this Sunscoop sunscreen body lotion and is honestly the most comfortable body sunscreen I’ve used. High protection, good ingredients, lightweight feel and no greasy mess. For daily use, it’s a solid 10 for me. \n\nDefinitely repurchasing!!!",

      "content": "Hi! I just cut my hair and I’m in the process of basically resetting it. I’m trying to get rid of all of my layers, though it’s mainly the super short face framing pieces that are bothering me. To cut it and even it out I put it in 2 low pigtails when wet and cut. After styling I went in to further even things out by pulling both sides under my chin and tying. I basically shaped it into a ball to get the stragglers. Then I put it in a low pony at the back and smoothed between 2 fingers to get any extra stragglers. Repeated that until it was straight and how I liked it. I’ll be cutting layers again once my hair is all one length (minus the bangs ofc), hopefully in about 6 months. This is the video I follow for cutting layers: https://youtu.be/rLsVd2AWW0A?si=jl6yAnLB2\\_NzClyD, which I won’t do again until my hair is fully reset. I think I’ll just completely leave out the face framing pieces, unless I cut it and decide I do want them. I honestly liked the method I did today so much I’ll probably continue doing it when I cut layers again just to keep things nice and even. My goal is to have my hair to my butt when styled in a few years. I’ve been growing out my hair since 2023. 2023-2024 was basically just cutting out all the damage I had done. Before that, it wouldn’t grow past my shoulders because I dyed it and didn’t detangle it like I should’ve. My hair is the longest it’s ever been (but every time I say that my mom tells me it was long when I was little, but I don’t remember that lol). I think I could survive with my hair a few centimeters shorter, but I want to keep it long while I’m evening it out still, so the length it is now is probably what it will be until around August, or when it’s one length. I’ll trim it probably once a month on the new moon to promote new growth until then. Around my birthday in February, once it’s quite long but still one length, I’ll cut the layers again. I’ll do it around my birthday just because I usually only cut my hair once a year. Doing it around my birthday just makes sense because that also comes once a year lol. \n\nRoutine: \n\nShampoo: Shea Moisture raw shea butter shampoo\n\nDeep conditioner: Shea Moisture raw shea butter deep moisturizing masque \n\nConditioner: She Moisture raw shea butter conditioner\n\nLeave in: Shea Moisture raw shea butter deep moisturizing leave in conditioner\n\nStyling: Damp hair, a little product, brush\n\nDrying: I use a t shirt for a few minutes to get extra water, put product in, then use a hair dryer on medium/low heat and low blow, flipping my hair upside down for majority of the drying time, and switching between one side and the other. I don’t dry my hair with my head completely straight get as much volume as possible.",

And I have gotten bleach on this hair ONCE and no other dye.\n\nSecond- I regret the bleach job. I asked for more of an ombré look and protested highlights like this (even had so many reference pics), but whatever, I really didn’t care that much and was just happy to have something new so I didn’t complain when it was wrong, but I’m growing to hate it so much \n\nThis brings me to my main dilemma- \n\nI have just really not wanted to take the time to style it (usually when I use heat, I feel like it really shows off the highlights which I hate) but this is seemingly the only way to smooth the hair (see last picture, it’s doesn’t showcase the highlights there but you can see how tame it is) \n\nThe under layer of my hair is relatively smooth and tame, so I thought maybe I needed a shower filter- got one, hair has almost been worse? \n\nThe hair pictured here is after this routine:\n\nShampoo: Accure Hydration \n\nConditioner: same line\n\nLeave it: IGK 4 in 1 good behavior pump spray\n\nAir dried\n\nI never use a blow dryer because it gets inSANEly frizzy but lately even air dry looks so bad. I’m at a loss because IGK leave in gives me amazing results if I decide to use heat (in which case I add the aerosol version of to the dry hair) and up until lately I also felt like my hair looked decent with just it and no heat afterwards, idk what changed other than weather?\n\nPlease help me combat this frizzy result from air drying- would love a leave in product or shampoo/ conditioner recommendation!!!!",

Others are closed but I can feel hard nodules under the skin. They never seem to come to a head, which is frustrating! If I squeeze them, a string of sebum/dead skin comes out. \n\nSkin type: Dry/normal cheeks, oily T zone\n\nAM Routine\n\nKracie Naive green tea cleanser\n\nHyaluronic acid serum and ceramide toner (mixed together, I just pat it into my skin)\n\nCerave Daily Hydrating Lotion\n\nBeauty of Joseon Sunscreen\n\nPM Routine\n\nAnua oil cleanser\n\nKracie cleanser\n\nSerum and toner combo\n\nPaula’s Choice Barrier Repair moisturizer (retinol)\n\nSunflower or avocado oil\n\nAs needed: Glycolic acid on areas of hyperpigmentation\n\nWeekly: Clay mask, sheet mask\n\nBiweekly/monthly: Ordinary AHA/BHA mask\n\nAny advice on products I should add in/remove? I’ve been thinking that I should just get these professionally extracted, but still need help figuring out how to prevent them, especially since it’s been my problem area for over a decade.\n\nThanks!!",

Is there anything specifically you might recommend for this mane of mine?\n\nAs far as routine, I wash and condition daily with dove shampoo and conditioner. I rinse in cool water, upside down, and then apply leave in conditioner. Brand depends on availability at TJ Maxx since I'm trying different things, but right now it's Curl Smith. From there, I apply a bit of Lotta Body foaming mousse and pop everything in a silk bonnet for sleep and my hair is dry and looks like this in the morning. \n\nI'd been treating my hair this way for about 2 months after noticing some waves starting halfway down my back, but I feel a little lost. Currently having a tiny identity crisis because I went from the 2a to curls pipeline REAL fast. I'm not confident enough to say which hair type I have now, because it seems like its evolving a bit.\n\nThe closeup photo is from this morning, and the longer shot is from Saturday when my hair was cut. It can cut dry, and then a bit of Lotta Body wash applied in the salon, so lots of touching ans manipulation on that day. After not touching it and proceeding as normal the curls appear to have enhanced. ",

My baby hairs and the front pieces curl tightly from root to tip, but in the back, only the ends curl while the roots stay flat. I washed with L’Oréal Gloss Shampoo and used the L’Oréal Dream Long Conditioner. After that, I applied Camille Rose Moisture Milk, even though I know it’s too heavy for my hair—I just ran out of my usual Ouai leave-in spray. Even when I use the Ouai, my hair still doesn’t curl from the roots. After the leave-in, I applied mousse and Cantu Avocado Gel, then diffused. My hair actually looked curlier when it was wet, so I’m not sure what changed once it dried. Does anyone have tips on how to get curls to form at the roots? Also, I don’t heat-style my hair—the only heat I use is from a diffuser with heat protection or from the sun.\n\n1st photo is when its wet (finger curled)\n\n2nd when its dry (finger curled)\n\n3rd my regular routine \n\n4th my front hairs (finger curled but usually look the exact same without finger curling)",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

How early do you wake up compared to when you need to leave? I’m not a morning person, but I do get up 2 hours before I leave, I usually shower and then sit and drink my coffee, eat breakfast about 40 minutes before I leave, and then I get dressed and go. But because of this routine my hair is always looking a mess (I’m growing a perm out currently which is also making my hair worse), my face is bare (which is okay, but it’s not feeling like me anymore). I have a simple makeup routine id like to do, and I frankly just need to make myself do it. \n\nWhat does your morning routine look like? What are your reasons for doing hair/makeup every day?

      "content": "I’m 49 with typical aging skin struggles (sun damage, wrinkles, dryness etc.) The dryness is fairly new but quite uncomfortable because of perimenopause. However, I also still have the acne and (it seems to me) sluggish skin cell turnover leading to clogged pores, that I’ve had for about 30 years now. The tops of my cheeks in particular are pretty bad with blackheads and closed comedones, though age and changing my pillowcase more often seems to have helped a little. I get a few cystic pimples but it’s not as bothersome as it used to be.\n\nI tried adapalene about a year ago because I was getting sick of how dull and congested my face looks, and I had heard it was good for anti-aging as well as acne. I didn’t know to start slow and use the sandwich method, so it caused my eyelids and a ring around my neck to be horribly dry, scaly and painful for days after each application, plus my eyes looked 10 years older. I gave up pretty quickly.\n\nI saw that retinal is another retinoid that is slightly less strong, so I bought the e.l.f. Youth Boosting Advanced Night retinoid serum. I recently used up the bottle, and it seemed to agree with my skin just fine and not dry me out, but it also didn’t seem to do much per se.\n\nRecently I tried adapalene again. This time I put on Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream over my whole face and neck and Cerave balm around my eyes, eyelids, and the crease of my neck when I got out of the shower. I waited a good hour after this to apply a pea-sized amount of adapalene. I didn’t apply it anywhere near my neck or eyes—just cheeks,  forehead, and chin. I did this twice a week for 2 weeks. It took a bit longer to happen, but I had the same problem as before and it seemed to get worse each time. Angry itchy ring around my neck, scaly crusty eyelids and painfully dry eyes. I assume my skin barrier is completely messed up. The skin around my eyes is so crepey and wrinkled. Granted I have a cold right now too, but one of my eyes looks half swollen shut 😑 I looked over discussions about allergic reactions, and I don’t think it’s that because these are all common symptoms others report that go away over time, but I just can’t deal with the discomfort any longer so I’m going to discontinue the adapalene again.\n\nWhat retinoid would you try next if you were me? Or should I avoid them? This is really bumming me out.",
