This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

And I have gotten bleach on this hair ONCE and no other dye.\n\nSecond- I regret the bleach job. I asked for more of an ombré look and protested highlights like this (even had so many reference pics), but whatever, I really didn’t care that much and was just happy to have something new so I didn’t complain when it was wrong, but I’m growing to hate it so much \n\nThis brings me to my main dilemma- \n\nI have just really not wanted to take the time to style it (usually when I use heat, I feel like it really shows off the highlights which I hate) but this is seemingly the only way to smooth the hair (see last picture, it’s doesn’t showcase the highlights there but you can see how tame it is) \n\nThe under layer of my hair is relatively smooth and tame, so I thought maybe I needed a shower filter- got one, hair has almost been worse? \n\nThe hair pictured here is after this routine:\n\nShampoo: Accure Hydration \n\nConditioner: same line\n\nLeave it: IGK 4 in 1 good behavior pump spray\n\nAir dried\n\nI never use a blow dryer because it gets inSANEly frizzy but lately even air dry looks so bad. I’m at a loss because IGK leave in gives me amazing results if I decide to use heat (in which case I add the aerosol version of to the dry hair) and up until lately I also felt like my hair looked decent with just it and no heat afterwards, idk what changed other than weather?\n\nPlease help me combat this frizzy result from air drying- would love a leave in product or shampoo/ conditioner recommendation!!!!",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

      "content": "The last time I finger curled my hair was about two years ago, and now I remember why. The curls just don’t start at the roots in the back of my hair at all. My baby hairs and the front pieces curl tightly from root to tip, but in the back, only the ends curl while the roots stay flat. I washed with L’Oréal Gloss Shampoo and used the L’Oréal Dream Long Conditioner. After that, I applied Camille Rose Moisture Milk, even though I know it’s too heavy for my hair—I just ran out of my usual Ouai leave-in spray. Even when I use the Ouai, my hair still doesn’t curl from the roots. After the leave-in, I applied mousse and Cantu Avocado Gel, then diffused. My hair actually looked curlier when it was wet, so I’m not sure what changed once it dried. Does anyone have tips on how to get curls to form at the roots? Also, I don’t heat-style my hair—the only heat I use is from a diffuser with heat protection or from the sun.\n\n1st photo is when its wet (finger curled)\n\n2nd when its dry (finger curled)\n\n3rd my regular routine \n\n4th my front hairs (finger curled but usually look the exact same without finger curling)",

I understand it has something to do with cellular energy and repair but not sure how well it actually penetrates skin or whether topical application does anything meaningful.\n\nIs this the next niacinamide where it actually works or the next collagen cream where its basically expensive moisturizer?\n\nTrying not to add more steps to my routine unless theres a good reason so would love to hear from people who have actually tried nad+ products and whether you noticed any difference.",
