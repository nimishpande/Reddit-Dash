After I get out of the shower I apply spray leave-in conditioner (Dippity Doo) and my curls look much nicer!! In the mornings/when I haven't showered I use Not Your Mother's curl mousse to style.\n\nAlthough I'm really glad I've gotten my curls to come out, I'm still wondering how I can improve my hair further.

Over time, it has slowly expanded and now covers a larger part of my back and slightly towards my shoulders. It doesn’t itch and usually feels smooth, not rough or painful. Its mainly a cosmetic issue (colour/texture change).\n\nI have been to three different dermatologists and got different opinions:\n\n* One diagnosed it as lichen amyloidosis\n* Another said its chronic inflammation\n* Another said its something that can’t really be “fixed” and is cosmetic\n\nI have been using prescribed creams and moisturisers, but I am not sure if its helping much. It seems to slowly expand over time, which worries me.",

I tried diets, changing bed clothes daily, different products but nothing. I got bullied badly for it and want to start summer fresh. So I went to the doctor and they gave me epiduo.\nEpiduo is meant to help clear spots after a few months but first its meant to be really bad. I have sensitive skin and every time I use epiduo it burns pretty much. After I wash  it off I put NIVEA moisturiser on but it stings like hell. \nYes ive noticed an improvement with my spots not being as red but my cheeks turn red after applying this gel and only after 30 mins does it die down. Has anyone here used epiduo gel before and how long do I gotta go until it stops stinging? I just want my acne gone so badly as I got bullied and dont want to be bullied for the dry skin occurring or the redness on my cheeks.\nAny advice would be great. Thank you!",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

Their hair grows. It’s called science. You didn’t invent evolution.\n\nLet’s talk about your lack of common sense - you aren’t even a brand that specializes in children. What was the reason you used an infant in an advertisement, in order to have parents feel that their child is growing at an unacceptable rate?\n\nThis isn’t marketing, it’s desperation and to do so using an innocent infant.\n\nShould you, instead of using infants to gain emotional sympathy, focus your time on developing a solid product for adults?

PS: I shave my eyebrows and they come back thicker as before.\nI do want to get laser treatment eventually, but I’m a student right now so it’s not financially possible.\nFor now, what would you recommend? Is shaving actually safe, or are there better temporary options? I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences.\nThanks!",

Over time, it has slowly expanded and now covers a larger part of my back and slightly towards my shoulders. It doesn’t itch and usually feels smooth, not rough or painful. Its mainly a cosmetic issue (colour/texture change).\n\nI have been to three different dermatologists and got different opinions:\n\n* One diagnosed it as lichen amyloidosis\n* Another said its chronic inflammation\n* Another said its something that can’t really be “fixed” and is cosmetic\n\nI have been using prescribed creams and moisturisers, but I am not sure if its helping much. It seems to slowly expand over time, which worries me.",

To deal with gym anxiety I try to go at off hours, but sometimes I still end up staying longer than planned and getting really sweaty.\n\n  \nMy issue is that my face has started feeling tight and looking irritated around my nose and mouth, plus I am getting small bumps on my forehead that come and go. I do not want a diagnosis, just trying to figure out if my routine is too harsh or if I am missing something.\n\n  \nCurrent routine:\n\nAM\n\n\\- Rinse with water\n\n\\- Basic fragrance free moisturizer\n\n\\- Sunscreen if I am outside (I do not always reapply)\n\n  \nPM (after the gym)\n\n\\- Cleanser in the shower (I use it once, sometimes twice if I feel gross)\n\n\\- Moisturizer\n\n  \nExtra details:\n\n\\- I usually wipe my face with a towel mid workout, and sometimes I use the gym paper towels if I forget mine.\n\n\\- I shower at the gym about half the time. Other days I wait until I get home 45 to 60 minutes later.\n\n\\- I do not use any exfoliating acids or retinoids right now because I was worried about making the irritation worse.\n\n  \nQuestions:\n\n1) Is cleansing in the gym shower plus again at home too much, or should I just do one proper cleanse per day?\n\n2) Any tips for handling sweat without rubbing my face raw?\n\n3) If you think I should add something for the bumps, what would be the gentlest place to start without nuking my skin barrier?\n\n  \nHappy to adjust habits, I just need a simple plan I can stick to on busy days.",
