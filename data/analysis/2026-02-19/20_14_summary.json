I use it every other night on dry skin, and apply avene cicalfate after 10-30 mins.\n\nI’m planning on switching to same strength but in the gel formula due to feeling super oily with the cream and hearing the gel is better for acne prone skin.\n\nWould appreciate any advice from anyone who’s done the switch. Can I just simply maintain my current routine but with the gel? Or should I start slow and build up again?\n\nWas it beneficial? Did you prefer the gel or the cream?\n\nFeeling nervous as I’m just turning the corner from the painful purge phase and don’t want to cause any irritation!!\n\nThanks 🥹",

Over time, it has slowly expanded and now covers a larger part of my back and slightly towards my shoulders. It doesn’t itch and usually feels smooth, not rough or painful. Its mainly a cosmetic issue (colour/texture change).\n\nI have been to three different dermatologists and got different opinions:\n\n* One diagnosed it as lichen amyloidosis\n* Another said its chronic inflammation\n* Another said its something that can’t really be “fixed” and is cosmetic\n\nI have been using prescribed creams and moisturisers, but I am not sure if its helping much. It seems to slowly expand over time, which worries me.",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I’m trying to see if a protein treatment would help restore my curls. I find myself washing my hair more because I can never refresh my curls after sleeping - after two days, my hair is very dry/coarse,frizzy and greasy (even if I put my hair in a bonnet or a pineapple bun). \n\nMy daily routine:\n\noccasionally use Olaplex Bond Maintenence shampoo/conditioner as clarifying \n\nswitched to NYM naturel curl defining shampoo and conditioner when not clarifying (not a huge fan so far- used to use ouidad moisture lock s/c)\n\nbrush when wet, then Ouai leave-in conditioner\n\nMiss Jessie feather soft curl cream or davines curl serum\n\nsometimes use Ouidaid gel cream in substitute of a curl cream\n\nscrunch and diffuse, then add a hair oil \n\nany type of mousse or gel leaves my hair so stiff and even after I scrunch with oil. My curls get really greasy if I apply too many products or do the CGM. \n\nWith my latest routine, tried to restore my curls by using a deep conditioner mask for 5 mins, then leave in and mousse while still in shower but my wet hair was still straight even after scrunching - it was only when diffusing that some of the curls/waves arrived. \n\nI’m trying to see if I have moisture overload. I used to do the LOC method (leave in, oil, curl cream) and my curls were great! But my hair is not curling even when wet so I am at a loss of what to do. Please let me know if a protein treatment would help or am I due for a trim?\n\nThank you!!!",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

Their hair grows. It’s called science. You didn’t invent evolution.\n\nLet’s talk about your lack of common sense - you aren’t even a brand that specializes in children. What was the reason you used an infant in an advertisement, in order to have parents feel that their child is growing at an unacceptable rate?\n\nThis isn’t marketing, it’s desperation and to do so using an innocent infant.\n\nShould you, instead of using infants to gain emotional sympathy, focus your time on developing a solid product for adults?

      "content": "So after over 20 years of thinking I had straight hair, I found out I have natural waves! Did a huge chop and got some light layering to help bring out the texture, but I'm not 100% sure where my wave pattern falls as far as 2a/2b. I know my hair is very fine, high density, and low porosity, but wondering if I just need to give it time or if I could improve my routineto help my waves get tighter or more defined. I just barely started a curly/wavy hair routine a few days ago so current wash day routine is as follows:\n\n1. Wash with sulfate and silicone-free shampoo - currently trying Native coconut and vanilla\n\n2. Light condition on ends with Native coconut and vanilla, wet detangle with comb.\n\n3. Squeeze out excess water/scrunch lightly with cotton t shirt to get more out.\n\n4. Glaze on/use prayers hands to apply Garnier Fructis curl creation mousse. Lightly scrunch, then plop for 30 minutes.\n\n5. Diffuse on low heat to 90% dry. Tried air drying on day 1 but the weight of my wet hair pulled everything mostly straight.\n\nThis is the only routine I've tried so far, looking for high hold product recommendations/routine changes/really any advice on long term wavy hair care and things that might help with wave structure and retention. Thank you guys in advance, I'm so excited to begin my wavy hair journey!",

I've been growing my hair out for the past year after basically 30 years of asking my barber for the same \"short back and sides\" and now I have no idea what to do with it really.\n\nThe 2nd pic is a style I kinda like but I don't know what to ask for or if it's even worth going to a barber for. Do I need to go to an actual salon instead?\n\nAlso since we're here, how often do I need to shampoo/conditioner now? I've been doing it every other day and it seems fine but would be good to know if that's not enough/too little etc etc.... I also apply some leave in conditioner too after a shower.\n\nAnd also I've come to realise that quite a bit of hair comes out when I do wash it. That's normal, right? I'm not too concerned about it being me balding or anything, but some reassurances that it's a regular part of washing it would be nice I guess.\n\nSorry for what might be inane questions, I've just never had hair this long before and while I might be confused, I do quite enjoy having it!\n\nTIA",

      "content": "After years of trying everything, from Clinique’s 3-step routine, to Korean 7-step skincare, to simply washing with water I achieved in two months what I’d been trying to accomplish for over a decade.\n\nI’ve been Sephora Rouge for more years than I’d like to admit, cycling through clean beauty, Estee Lauder serums, Korean skincare, and more. Recently, I went to a dermatologist to check an irregular mole my doctor had noticed. Thankfully, it wasn’t a problem. While I was there, I asked about a red bump and a skin-colored bump on my face. She prescribed ivermectin and a retinoid, ivermectin for rosacea, and the retinoid to smooth texture and fine lines.\n\nAfter three months, I can’t believe the results. After years of relying on concealer, foundation, redness-reducing products, salicylic acid, and countless routines, I finally have clear, smooth skin. I now understand the recommendations to use Vaseline when starting a retinoid (it used to break me out but now it helps), and the importance of ceramides for skin support.\n\nI spent SO much time and money searching for one miracle product that made only the smallest difference. I didn’t realize that a dermatologist could prescribe something targeted, something medically designed to address the root of my issues. After all those mornings and nights, all that money, and all the desperation for “glass skin” I could never achieve, I feel both sad for my past self (my boyfriend looking at my green masks or unable to kiss my while stuff dries) and relieved by what I’ve learned.\n\nThe takeaway isn’t to get these exact prescriptions. It’s that we can relax and recognize that over-the-counter products may not be enough for certain concerns like rosacea (which I didn’t even realize I had), persistent bumps, or wrinkles.\n\nIf you’re able to, consider seeing a dermatologist before spending hundreds of hours and dollars chasing results that may be difficult or impossible to achieve without medically targeted treatments. Many people with consistently clear skin may be using prescription-strength products, even if we don’t always realize it.\n\nI’ve come to see it like wanting a celebrity’s body and thinking daily jogging would get me there while forgetting that they’re often training two to three hours a day with a professional and following highly structured juicing or nutrition plans. It’s not about failure or effort. Sometimes, it’s about access to the right tools and expertise. If I could go back in time I'd just let my little spots or redness be, it was never something I had to spend all that time and money trying to fix. I thought I had bad skin all this time when I was comparing myself to skin influencers using tretinoin or wtv.",
