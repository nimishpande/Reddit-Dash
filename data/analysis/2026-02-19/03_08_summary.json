I personally struggled my entire life with growing my hair to my mermaid dreams, and its finally happening. I have NEVER been someone who says \"My hair grows really fast,\" but now I can see actual progress, when before, my hair would literally never grow beyond my shoulders (when curly). My hair journey is as follows\n\nMiddle school: Str\\*\\*tened my hair several times per week :(\n\nHigh School: Realized how damaged my hair was and dove headfirst into the Curly Girl method. This was not the way FOR ME, personally. I did this throughout college. My scalp was SCREAMING. I also had bad brushing habits and my hair was constantly dry. BUT, it was cute, and my curl pattern came back. I was doing crazy shit you guys. I was putting eggs and avocado on my head. I was dry detangling my hair for an hour with my fingers. I was using all natural shampoos that had the washing power of candle wax. These were not the days.\n\nPost College: Gave up on my dreams. I started using Head and Shoulders, all of the sulfates and silicones (go figure) and kept it basically all drugstore.\n\nEarly 2025: Discovered the Abbey Yung method... and I gotta say... it makes sense.\n\nI just want to say I know that hair is different for everyone, but leaving the CGM did wonders for my hair growth and health. I thought that Head and Shoulders would dry my hair out, but I have quickly discovered that with the right level of conditioning and oils, all of my hair is happier than ever.\n\nCurrent Routine:\n\nUsually a pre oil treatment or Olaplex 3 (K18 after a tax return though, you feel me??)\n\nHead and shoulders (never 2-in-1, though wondering if I should try it for extra conditioning) rinse and repeat. Usually leave on for a few minutes to let the medication settle in.\n\nConditioner: Matrix Food for Soft OR Dove 10-in-1 serum Bond Strength Mask\n\nLeave in: Usually Miss Jessie's Leave-In Condish (the best!) Currently trying Redken ABC. Had high hopes, but it's not thick enough for my hair and doesn't give me the best detangling experience.\n\nCurl Cream: Trying Curls Don't Lie by Isima. Its not a 10/10 but its pretty good!\n\nAir dry: always, because I find it easier.\n\nOil: my lengths with MoroccanOil or OGx Coconut Miracle Oil every other day-ish, depending on literally nothing except what's easier to reach for in my cabinet.\n\nI don't refresh other than oil, I just let it go and look a bit frizzy. Less is more for me\n\n  \nIf you've read this far, what product surprised you or helped you tremendously in reaching your hair goals?? xoxo ",

      "content": " \nI was using minimalist and plum sunscreens last year and they just felt very sticky, greasy or just uncomfortable out in the sun. But this sunscoop actually feels like a proper body lotion that just happens to have SPF 50+ PA++++ in it. Like i just get out of the shower, pump it out like a normal body lotion which acts as a sunscreen too 😭\n\n**Texture and feel**\nVery smooth lotion texture. Not runny, not thick and spreads easily and absorbs pretty fast. After it settles, it doesn’t feel heavy or oily. My skin just feels normal and soft. I can get dressed in a few minutes without that sticky sunscreen feeling.\n\nIt’s SPF 50+ PA++++ with broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection. I’ve worn it out in proper sun and didn’t notice tanning or redness. \n\n**Ingredients I liked**\nWhat makes it better than basic sunscreens is the added skincare.\n5 percent Niacinamide to help with pigmentation and even skin tone.\nIt has 5 Essential Ceramides too.\n\n**Full ingredient list on the bottle:**\nPurified Water, Octocrylene, Niacinamide, Octyl Salicylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Trehalose, Methylene Bis Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Avena Sativa Oat Kernel Extract, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Aloe Vera Extract, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Propanediol, 1,2 Hexanediol, Hexyldecanol, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Ceramide AS, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide NG, Sodium Acrylate Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, C15 19 Alkane, Fragrance, Sodium Polyacrylate, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer 6, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium EDTA, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum.\n\nIt’s also free from Benzophenone, Formaldehyde &amp; Oxybenzone, atleast that's what the bottle says.\n\n**Hydration**\nIt actually feels moisturizing. I’ve skipped my regular body lotion a few times and this alone was enough. No dryness, no tightness.\n\nI do not write such long reviews but i am fr in love with this Sunscoop sunscreen body lotion and is honestly the most comfortable body sunscreen I’ve used. High protection, good ingredients, lightweight feel and no greasy mess. For daily use, it’s a solid 10 for me. \n\nDefinitely repurchasing!!!",

I’m on the partnerships side at Dr. B and occasionally lurk here.\n\nSince oral Minoxidil comes up a lot in this sub, I wanted to share that as of this week it's available through our platform at [drb.ai](https://drb.ai/care/dermatology/hair-loss?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=oral-minoxidil-launch&amp;utm_term=partner).\n\nIf medically appropriate, it can be prescribed alongside other hair loss meds (eg. Finasteride) during the same $15 consultation, so you don’t have to coordinate care across multiple visits/providers.\n\nI’m not a clinician and can’t provide medical advice, but you can always reach out to our support team on our site if you have questions!

      "content": "Hi! I just cut my hair and I’m in the process of basically resetting it. I’m trying to get rid of all of my layers, though it’s mainly the super short face framing pieces that are bothering me. To cut it and even it out I put it in 2 low pigtails when wet and cut. After styling I went in to further even things out by pulling both sides under my chin and tying. I basically shaped it into a ball to get the stragglers. Then I put it in a low pony at the back and smoothed between 2 fingers to get any extra stragglers. Repeated that until it was straight and how I liked it. I’ll be cutting layers again once my hair is all one length (minus the bangs ofc), hopefully in about 6 months. This is the video I follow for cutting layers: https://youtu.be/rLsVd2AWW0A?si=jl6yAnLB2\\_NzClyD, which I won’t do again until my hair is fully reset. I think I’ll just completely leave out the face framing pieces, unless I cut it and decide I do want them. I honestly liked the method I did today so much I’ll probably continue doing it when I cut layers again just to keep things nice and even. My goal is to have my hair to my butt when styled in a few years. I’ve been growing out my hair since 2023. 2023-2024 was basically just cutting out all the damage I had done. Before that, it wouldn’t grow past my shoulders because I dyed it and didn’t detangle it like I should’ve. My hair is the longest it’s ever been (but every time I say that my mom tells me it was long when I was little, but I don’t remember that lol). I think I could survive with my hair a few centimeters shorter, but I want to keep it long while I’m evening it out still, so the length it is now is probably what it will be until around August, or when it’s one length. I’ll trim it probably once a month on the new moon to promote new growth until then. Around my birthday in February, once it’s quite long but still one length, I’ll cut the layers again. I’ll do it around my birthday just because I usually only cut my hair once a year. Doing it around my birthday just makes sense because that also comes once a year lol. \n\nRoutine: \n\nShampoo: Shea Moisture raw shea butter shampoo\n\nDeep conditioner: Shea Moisture raw shea butter deep moisturizing masque \n\nConditioner: She Moisture raw shea butter conditioner\n\nLeave in: Shea Moisture raw shea butter deep moisturizing leave in conditioner\n\nStyling: Damp hair, a little product, brush\n\nDrying: I use a t shirt for a few minutes to get extra water, put product in, then use a hair dryer on medium/low heat and low blow, flipping my hair upside down for majority of the drying time, and switching between one side and the other. I don’t dry my hair with my head completely straight get as much volume as possible.",

And I have gotten bleach on this hair ONCE and no other dye.\n\nSecond- I regret the bleach job. I asked for more of an ombré look and protested highlights like this (even had so many reference pics), but whatever, I really didn’t care that much and was just happy to have something new so I didn’t complain when it was wrong, but I’m growing to hate it so much \n\nThis brings me to my main dilemma- \n\nI have just really not wanted to take the time to style it (usually when I use heat, I feel like it really shows off the highlights which I hate) but this is seemingly the only way to smooth the hair (see last picture, it’s doesn’t showcase the highlights there but you can see how tame it is) \n\nThe under layer of my hair is relatively smooth and tame, so I thought maybe I needed a shower filter- got one, hair has almost been worse? \n\nThe hair pictured here is after this routine:\n\nShampoo: Accure Hydration \n\nConditioner: same line\n\nLeave it: IGK 4 in 1 good behavior pump spray\n\nAir dried\n\nI never use a blow dryer because it gets inSANEly frizzy but lately even air dry looks so bad. I’m at a loss because IGK leave in gives me amazing results if I decide to use heat (in which case I add the aerosol version of to the dry hair) and up until lately I also felt like my hair looked decent with just it and no heat afterwards, idk what changed other than weather?\n\nPlease help me combat this frizzy result from air drying- would love a leave in product or shampoo/ conditioner recommendation!!!!",

So here I am 😊\n\nI’m 27F with sensitive combination skin. My main concerns are: texture, pores, skin discoloration and acne.\n\nHere are the products I currently have:\n\nBotanics the power of plants:\n\nOrganic Revitalising Mist \n\nAll bright Glow Toner\n\nAll bright Revitalising Cleanser\n\nAll bright smoothing face scrub\n\nAll bright Recharging Night Cream\n\nHydrating Lightweight Gel Moisturizer \n\nAll bright Energising Bi-Phase Oil\n\nAll bright 3% Caffeine Awakening Eye Serum\n\nAll bright Vitamin C Glow Serum\n\nHydrating Plumping Serum \n\nOrganic Restoring Overnight Facial Oil\n\nAnd\n\nCetaphil Ceramide Serum\n\nCetaphil Derma Control Oil Absorbing Moisturizer with sunscreen spf 30\n\nI’d love some help figuring out:\n\nWhat order to use these in (AM vs PM)\n\nLike a schedule\n\nWhat shouldn’t be mixed together\n\nHow often I should be using certain actives with sensitive skin\n\nIf anything here might be overkill\n\nI’m honestly just trying not to wreck my skin while still making progress 😅 Any advice or routine suggestions would be super appreciated. Thank you!!",

Is there anything specifically you might recommend for this mane of mine?\n\nAs far as routine, I wash and condition daily with dove shampoo and conditioner. I rinse in cool water, upside down, and then apply leave in conditioner. Brand depends on availability at TJ Maxx since I'm trying different things, but right now it's Curl Smith. From there, I apply a bit of Lotta Body foaming mousse and pop everything in a silk bonnet for sleep and my hair is dry and looks like this in the morning. \n\nI'd been treating my hair this way for about 2 months after noticing some waves starting halfway down my back, but I feel a little lost. Currently having a tiny identity crisis because I went from the 2a to curls pipeline REAL fast. I'm not confident enough to say which hair type I have now, because it seems like its evolving a bit.\n\nThe closeup photo is from this morning, and the longer shot is from Saturday when my hair was cut. It can cut dry, and then a bit of Lotta Body wash applied in the salon, so lots of touching ans manipulation on that day. After not touching it and proceeding as normal the curls appear to have enhanced. ",

Today I decided to finally test if I could bring out my curls/waves and at least see what I could have safe to say I bit off way more then I could chew. I fallowed a video I seen awhile ago by memory, I first wet my hair then did this like scrunchy thing with it. After I put a brand of hair gel (pictured) and scrunched that in for a few minutes then put the moose (pictured) in it and scrunched it in and dryed it with the head pictured on high blow and high heat. My usual routine when I wash my hair (I use the products pictured) I usually only shampoo once or twice a week and I used to take the curly conditioner and scrunch it in in the morning and that would curlify my hair a bit.",

      "content": "My hair used to me straight with light waves, but then I had a child, underwent chemotherapy, had a kidney transplant and now my hair texture has become this and I don't know how to style or wear it anymore. I used to be able to brush my hair and leave the home, but now if I brush it out it becomes a frizzy, poofy nightmare. I've tried curly hair routines I've seen online with using curl mousse, gel, anti frizz serum, oils, leave in conditioner and all of that, but the top half of my head still stays straight-ish and frizzy. The back and bottom half of my hair has no problem taking on those curls but it's the front and top front layer of my hair that just won't hold any curl. I'm not sure how to wear my hair anymore or if I should just straighten it or get a haircut. I also am not sure if my hair is considered curly or wavy or how to approach it lol.\n\nWhat I did for this photo and what I've been doing now trying to embrace the curls rather than resort to straightening it: \n\nRoutine:\n\n\\- shampooed with amika anti frizz shampoo\n\n\\- conditioner - not your mothers bond building curl talk conditioner\n\nWashed, brushed, then scrunched, added a heat protectant, and then diffused.\n\nAfter drying I added kerastse elixir ultime oil and scrunched more with that \n\nAnd then this is the result.\n\nI also have not your mothers nourishing curl talk leave in conditioner, Doux mousse def texture foam, Ouai anti frizz crème, and Ouidad ultimate climate control anti frizz heat and humidity gel.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!\n\nTLDR: used to have straight/wavy hair - life events caused me to have thick wavy/curly hair and the front top half of my head becomes super frizzy and won't hold curls easily. Looking for what type of hair I have and how I can style it or work with it",

My baby hairs and the front pieces curl tightly from root to tip, but in the back, only the ends curl while the roots stay flat. I washed with L’Oréal Gloss Shampoo and used the L’Oréal Dream Long Conditioner. After that, I applied Camille Rose Moisture Milk, even though I know it’s too heavy for my hair—I just ran out of my usual Ouai leave-in spray. Even when I use the Ouai, my hair still doesn’t curl from the roots. After the leave-in, I applied mousse and Cantu Avocado Gel, then diffused. My hair actually looked curlier when it was wet, so I’m not sure what changed once it dried. Does anyone have tips on how to get curls to form at the roots? Also, I don’t heat-style my hair—the only heat I use is from a diffuser with heat protection or from the sun.\n\n1st photo is when its wet (finger curled)\n\n2nd when its dry (finger curled)\n\n3rd my regular routine \n\n4th my front hairs (finger curled but usually look the exact same without finger curling)",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

He also doesn’t know anything either but we tried redkins curl line and he liked it at first but noticed hair thinning pretty soon after. I’m really wanting to find him a good curl shampoo and conditioner that at the very least won’t cause hair loss but maybe could help him with hair growth? I am not even sure what type of hair/ curl he has I just know around the edges seems more dry and his actually hair gets poofy basically the next day. He also has no clue how to get it cut up to this point he just got a basic cut and hoped for the best so he was also curious if there were any specific cuts he should ask for. Any advice is appreciated. ",

We air dry, the blow dryer is not an option. It would be like blow drying a large, angry cat. If it gets really frizzy we use some ouidad climate control spray. \n\nMy 15 year old daughter has very curly hair.  She also is diagnosed with autism, adhd, and bipolar 1. She has a lot of sensory issues. Getting through her hair routine is a nightmare in itself. \n\nIn between washes, her curls in back get flattened, which makes it look kind of matted. I know this is probably an impossibility, but does anyone have any advice to help that?  She can't handle having her hair pulled back, or wearing a bonnet- I've tried both. Does anyone have any ideas to keep her hair from looking like a family of possums has been living in it? Or maybe really cute short cuts that would just eliminate the problem? Here's what it looks like from the front,  then the back on wash day, then between washes.\n\nI know I'm probably asking for a solution that doesn't exist, but please be kind.  I'm just a mom that doesn't know what else to try,  but is tired of having her child's hair referred to as \"unkempt\"; and is equally tired of dealing with the meltdowns and angry outbursts when I try to put her hair up or use a bonnet for sleep.

I also sometimes hit my hair with a vitamin c spray to help with shine. \n\nSo I believe my hair is 2C/ 3A on a good day. It can honestly range from coils, loose curls and waves. My curl pattern has never really held well, I wear a hat for a day and my hair becomes wavy as seen on the second photo. I use bond treatments (like ever so often). My hair gets weighed down so much (I’ve tried mousses, sprays, gels, jelly, creams, custards, oils) all weighed down my hair. I find that my hair does enjoy those salt sprays but I’m aware that it’s probably not the best long term. I clarify my hair like twice a month for build up. Any tips help :)  ",
