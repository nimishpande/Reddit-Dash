      "content": "After years of trying everything, from Clinique’s 3-step routine, to Korean 7-step skincare, to simply washing with water I achieved in two months what I’d been trying to accomplish for over a decade.\n\nI’ve been Sephora Rouge for more years than I’d like to admit, cycling through clean beauty, Estee Lauder serums, Korean skincare, and more. Recently, I went to a dermatologist to check an irregular mole my doctor had noticed. Thankfully, it wasn’t a problem. While I was there, I asked about a red bump and a skin-colored bump on my face. She prescribed ivermectin and a retinoid, ivermectin for rosacea, and the retinoid to smooth texture and fine lines.\n\nAfter three months, I can’t believe the results. After years of relying on concealer, foundation, redness-reducing products, salicylic acid, and countless routines, I finally have clear, smooth skin. I now understand the recommendations to use Vaseline when starting a retinoid (it used to break me out but now it helps), and the importance of ceramides for skin support.\n\nI spent SO much time and money searching for one miracle product that made only the smallest difference. I didn’t realize that a dermatologist could prescribe something targeted, something medically designed to address the root of my issues. After all those mornings and nights, all that money, and all the desperation for “glass skin” I could never achieve, I feel both sad for my past self (my boyfriend looking at my green masks or unable to kiss my while stuff dries) and relieved by what I’ve learned.\n\nThe takeaway isn’t to get these exact prescriptions. It’s that we can relax and recognize that over-the-counter products may not be enough for certain concerns like rosacea (which I didn’t even realize I had), persistent bumps, or wrinkles.\n\nIf you’re able to, consider seeing a dermatologist before spending hundreds of hours and dollars chasing results that may be difficult or impossible to achieve without medically targeted treatments. Many people with consistently clear skin may be using prescription-strength products, even if we don’t always realize it.\n\nI’ve come to see it like wanting a celebrity’s body and thinking daily jogging would get me there while forgetting that they’re often training two to three hours a day with a professional and following highly structured juicing or nutrition plans. It’s not about failure or effort. Sometimes, it’s about access to the right tools and expertise. If I could go back in time I'd just let my little spots or redness be, it was never something I had to spend all that time and money trying to fix. I thought I had bad skin all this time when I was comparing myself to skin influencers using tretinoin or wtv.",

I find myself washing my hair more because I can never refresh my curls after sleeping - after two days, my hair is very dry/coarse,frizzy and greasy (even if I put my hair in a bonnet or a pineapple bun). \n\nMy daily routine:\n\noccasionally use Olaplex Bond Maintenence shampoo/conditioner as clarifying \n\nswitched to NYM naturel curl defining shampoo and conditioner when not clarifying (not a huge fan so far- used to use ouidad moisture lock s/c)\n\nbrush when wet, then Ouai leave-in conditioner\n\nMiss Jessie feather soft curl cream or davines curl serum\n\nsometimes use Ouidaid gel cream in substitute of a curl cream\n\nscrunch and diffuse, then add a hair oil \n\nany type of mousse or gel leaves my hair so stiff and even after I scrunch with oil. My curls get really greasy if I apply too many products or do the CGM. \n\nWith my latest routine, tried to restore my curls by using a deep conditioner mask for 5 mins, then leave in and mousse while still in shower but my wet hair was still straight even after scrunching - it was only when diffusing that some of the curls/waves arrived. \n\nI’m trying to see if I have moisture overload. I used to do the LOC method (leave in, oil, curl cream) and my curls were great! But my hair is not curling even when wet so I am at a loss of what to do. Please let me know if a protein treatment would help or am I due for a trim?\n\nThank you!!!",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

Over time, it has slowly expanded and now covers a larger part of my back and slightly towards my shoulders. It doesn’t itch and usually feels smooth, not rough or painful. Its mainly a cosmetic issue (colour/texture change).\n\nI have been to three different dermatologists and got different opinions:\n\n* One diagnosed it as lichen amyloidosis\n* Another said its chronic inflammation\n* Another said its something that can’t really be “fixed” and is cosmetic\n\nI have been using prescribed creams and moisturisers, but I am not sure if its helping much. It seems to slowly expand over time, which worries me.",

      "content": "Before anyone says anything, yes, I'm aware that my skin probably isn't \"that bad\" compared to other high schoolers. I know. I'm aware. That doesn't stop me from being obsessed and neurotic about it, though.\n\nI don't think I'm ugly at all, in fact I quite like how I look for the most part. The shitty phone camera and the lighting certainly aren't doing me any favours though, so I've thrown in a couple photos of what I look like when I'm not scrutinising myself in the mirror.\n\nHowever, despite my efforts, I feel like my skin has only been getting worse in the past few months. I'm hygienic, I use face wash, I exfoliate, I moisturise, I don't pick at acne, etcetera. So I'm at a loss, and I'd like some help. I have two blackheads (although they're not very noticeable), plenty of little spots of hyperpigmentation all over my face, a patch of what I assume are closed comedones on the left side of my face as well as possibly on my forehead, oddly reddish and irritated skin around my nostrils that I can't seem to get rid of, two wrinkles on my forehead that seem to be permanent (no, neither moisturising nor hydration help), and two scuffs above and below my lips that I'm *fairly* sure will heal fine without issue but that I want to make sure leave absolutely *no* marks. So, what am I meant to do?\n\nMy routine is fairly consistent but not universal.\n\nIn the mornings, if I have time, I wash my face with cold water and use Cetaphil oily facial cleanser; on top of that I pretty liberally apply CeraVe and Equate moisturiser. For the areas around my nose and mouth with the reddish skin, I use CeraVe *intense* moisturiser, plus some Aquaphor. It helps marginally. At night, I exfoliate using Neutrogena (this is daily, and possibly excessive), and after I'm out of the shower I typically use identical products to what I used in the morning. When it comes to acne, I don't get it often, but it's a pain in the ass when I do. I typically allow it to develop into a whitehead over the course of the day, before using clean tweezers to gently remove the tip, and then gently scrunch the skin around the pimple to draw out the pus. I sort of \"grab\" the pus with the tweezers, which works surprisingly well, and rinse and repeat until only a clear fluid is coming out. Then, I let it heal and close off until bed, before applying tea tree oil and witch hazel and moisturising around it. If I do it right, I don't even need a hydrocolloid bandage.\n\nHow am I doing? Are these products alright? What do I need to do differently?\n\nI don't have the free time to spend hours shopping and researching, so it'd be great to get some more information. I don't really care about the cost of the products I'm recommended, I have a job, so anything is a good recommendation *as long as it's effective*.\n\nI don't exactly know what my skin type is, sorry. Maybe dry-ish? Not naturally oily, unless I'm misusing these terms.\n\nOne final note: I am seeing a dermatologist soon. Hopefully that'll help.",

I suppose they are exceptions, but there are so many now that I sometimes seriously doubt it. Others have a calm, stress-free life, a good diet, but have been bald since their 20s.

It would be my first peel and I’m wondering if I should wait for these PIE marks / couple of freshly healed blemishes to fade fully before doing the peel. I’ve been using azelaic acid for the past 3 months and its helped greatly. Skin was nearly clear so i ordered the peel, but foolishly decided to use this red light panel and it gave me a couple of new bumps. They aren’t inflamed, just pink. Would TCA make them darker and prolong healing? Also, if anyone knows, how would the Perfect Derma Peel compare? It sounds the most promising in terms of clinical peels. Should I just wait til the PIE fades then go in person for that, then maintain with TCA at home?",
