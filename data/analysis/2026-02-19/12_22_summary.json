I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

And I have gotten bleach on this hair ONCE and no other dye.\n\nSecond- I regret the bleach job. I asked for more of an ombré look and protested highlights like this (even had so many reference pics), but whatever, I really didn’t care that much and was just happy to have something new so I didn’t complain when it was wrong, but I’m growing to hate it so much \n\nThis brings me to my main dilemma- \n\nI have just really not wanted to take the time to style it (usually when I use heat, I feel like it really shows off the highlights which I hate) but this is seemingly the only way to smooth the hair (see last picture, it’s doesn’t showcase the highlights there but you can see how tame it is) \n\nThe under layer of my hair is relatively smooth and tame, so I thought maybe I needed a shower filter- got one, hair has almost been worse? \n\nThe hair pictured here is after this routine:\n\nShampoo: Accure Hydration \n\nConditioner: same line\n\nLeave it: IGK 4 in 1 good behavior pump spray\n\nAir dried\n\nI never use a blow dryer because it gets inSANEly frizzy but lately even air dry looks so bad. I’m at a loss because IGK leave in gives me amazing results if I decide to use heat (in which case I add the aerosol version of to the dry hair) and up until lately I also felt like my hair looked decent with just it and no heat afterwards, idk what changed other than weather?\n\nPlease help me combat this frizzy result from air drying- would love a leave in product or shampoo/ conditioner recommendation!!!!",

      "content": "What is a low to medium price skincare routine you recommend for a 24 year old woman to start using?\n\nCurrently in the morning I use Byoma Moisturizing Gel-Cream, and at night I use the Byoma Retinol Oil and their Moisturizing Rich Cream. I wash my face with La Roche-Posay Hydrating Facial Cleanser morning and night and I like that. However, I’m starting to notice some fine lines and I tend to get acne scars and pigmentation on my chin since that’s where I usually break out. I’m wondering if there is something better than these products?\n\nI have combination skin. It can get flaky around my nose, my T-zone gets oily, and the rest of my face is pretty normal. My skin also leans sensitive. At one point I was using The Ordinary Glycolic Acid, and I liked the exfoliation it gave me, but sometimes it made my face burn.\n\nI know there are probably things I should start doing now so I can age more gracefully, especially because I’m a high-stress and anxiety girly but I don’t want to overdo it and give myself chemical burns.\n\nI would rather keep the routine to be simple-moderate amount of steps and keep it fragrance free and stray away from anything that involves rolling things on my face or using light therapy.",
