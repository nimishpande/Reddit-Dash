At 16, I went on isotretinoin, and thankfully, it worked wonders—my skin has stayed mostly clear since then. For context, I also have PCOD.\n\nThat said, I’m still struggling with stubborn post-acne marks that refuse to fade. I occasionally get a breakout here and there too, and I’d love to know how to prevent those as well.\n\nI’m attaching reference photos for context. Could you please suggest effective serums or skincare routines/products that might help with fading these marks and keeping breakouts at bay?\n\nThanks so much in advance! 💙\n",
