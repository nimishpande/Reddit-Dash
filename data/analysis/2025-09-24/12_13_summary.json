      "content": "so i have to travel 3-4hrs a day for clg in Delhi's heat and im exposed to sun a lot for those reasons, and im unable to do anything about the tan. i'll share most things about my routine down here.\n\ni've been (irregularly, like 3-4 days a week) using a minimalist '16% vitamin c + e + ferulic acid' serum, and a mochi seramide toner my sister bought which i apply after facewash at night, this has given me a soft skin texture and feel but my skin still looks darkened/dull and uneven tone compared to my natural skin tone. \n\nrarely apply sunscreen, as it feels like a hassle early in the morning, and I don't really feel like it lasts much longer as i sweat a lot till the time i come back from clg in evening. now i can spend on 2-3 products but not more ig. Also i dont have anything to apply on my arms for tan. To add my water intake is also kinda low (will increase), does this also add up as a reason for dull skin ?\n\nPlease guide me on how i can cover these issues and adopt a basic skincare routine that is sustainable.",
