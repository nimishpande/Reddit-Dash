The skin is clearer than it's been in a long time.\n\n**The Unresolved Problem:**Â My dermatologist (rightfully) told me not to apply the topicals on the very sensitive skin in the creases of my nose and around my mouth. The problem is, the pustules I've always had in those specific spots are still there, and they're incredibly painful. Now that the rest of my face has cleared up, they feel more prominent and frustrating than ever. It's gotten so bad that it hurts to move my mouth.\n\n  \nFor those who also can't use strong topicals everywhere, how did you and your doctor address the stubborn spots in sensitive areas?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/89b20hygj5rf1.png?width=291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d08f424bc5860e1c566cedf6c29666f93f97112\n\n",

Im 22 a male from TÃ¼rkiye.\n\nFirst of all it happened back in like 2022, when i went to another city for uni.\n\nSometimes its a bit better but right now it got so worse i cant even focus on anything else.\n\n%99 of time after a shower i get this sensation that someone is poking through my skin in various places like the back of my shoulder, the back of my waist, both of my butts, my chest, my legs all around. Not so often on other areas. Never experienced it around my feet or hands. It usually takes about 20 minutes to go away by its own. I think its related to some sort of anxiety, stress or some nerveous system thing. I have tried every dermatologist. All the anti histamics, ketokonazol shampoo, moiusturizers. Nothing solves the problem at all. Its usually worse around summer-fall. I feel like ripping my own skin. No redness on my skin, no swelling, no nothing. Just this itching sensation coming and going like playing games with me. Hops around my body sometimes all at once and sometimes area by area. I have changed cities, soaps, it did not help at all. I have tried using different soaps, no soap, no shampoo, just regular water and still it was there. Neither cold or hot shower makes a difference. Neither drying myself immediately makes any difference. Couldnt find anything on internet usefull as well so here im just writing so maybe anyone else had some similar experience and got rid of it. My total blood count test came clear, my liver seems clear as well. Dont have fungi or anything like that as well. Like i said its only certain areas and they seem fine to doctors as well. Thanks for reading and hope you can help and somebody else who has similar problems find solution here.",
