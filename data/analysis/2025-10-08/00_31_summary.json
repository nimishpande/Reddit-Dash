I don't want to cut my hair, but I'm curious if it would make a big difference for my curls or not. The last time I dyed it was 5 years ago and the last time I cut it was 10 years ago. I think my hair is medium porosity and low elasticity. I have nightmares about cutting my hair and I fear if I actually did cut it, I would cry forever lol. But if cutting it brought my curls to my hair, I think it could be worth it.\n\nCurrent routine:\nI've just recently switched from head and shoulders shampoo (used for past 12 years) to Tea Tree Special Shampoo and I really love this new shampoo a lot more. I used The Doux Breakdown Clarifying Shampoo 3 weeks ago and I really liked it and will probably use that once a month or less depending on how my hair feels. For the past 5 years I've been using Aussie Miracle Moist Conditioner, but I've been wanting to play with new conditioners so in the first 2 pictures I have Tgin Green Tea Super Moist leave in Conditioner, and in the last picture I have the Aussie Conditioner in my hair. Whichever Conditioner I'm using, I always brush it through my hair and then scrunch it in at the ends, then I scrunch with a towel and then I air dry. In the last picture I used Curlsmith Hold me Softly Style Balm. In the first and second picture it's just the tgin conditioner.",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoeâ„¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

But in truth, it only seems to get bigger, not longer. \nSo what cut would you advice for me to get so, as it grows out, it can slowly turn into a mixture between both the examples in the second image? I want it to have shape, but very discreetly. So, in an elongated almong type of shape with long layers.\n\nWhat would you guys reccomend?\n\nMy routine:\n\n1. Shampoo scalp and ocassionally bring the lather down the rest of my hair and/or shampoo twice.\n2. Carol's daughter conditioner and detangle with one of those separate bristle brushes.\n3. Rosemary mint oil leave-in conditioner I found at burlington that is my best friend on my ends. Sometimes use rosemary oil on my scalp to stimulate growth.\n4. I use skala on the rest of my hair as a curl cream (I was unaware the leave-in was a leave-in, so it was unintentional but it works so hey)\n5. Use bounce curl brush dupe and divide my hair lazily and brush style.\n6. Either Aunt Jackie's or Camille rose gels and squish it in (Yes, squish, not scrunch. I gently pull the hair down for less shrinkage.)\n7. Air dry.\n",

      "content": "Hey guys,\nIâ€™m 23 and started my hair loss treatment about 6 months ago (topical minoxidil once a day, dermarolling once a week, and Nizoral twice a week). I was around a Norwood 2.5 when I began, and things actually went great at first â€” solid regrowth and stabilization.\n\nThen, around month 4, my scalp started getting itchy, red, and irritated. At first, I ignored it because my hair was still looking better. But later, the shedding became massive. At first, I thought it was just a second shed, but the timing felt off. My scalp started to actually hurt when touching it, so I switched from liquid min to foam. Sadly, nothing improved â€” the inflammation stayed, and the hair loss became insane.\n\nAfter a while, I decided to stop minoxidil completely, even the foam. Itâ€™s been about a month off now, and my scalp still hasnâ€™t fully recovered. Iâ€™ve seen a dermatologist who prescribed me anti-inflammatory meds, and Iâ€™m hoping that helps.\n\nBut hereâ€™s my real question:\nDo hairs that fall out due to scalp inflammation (and not DHT) actually regrow once the inflammation is gone? Because right now my density is terrible. My hairline didnâ€™t recede that much, but overall my scalp is clearly visible.\n\nI used to think Iâ€™d be able to keep my hair for another 2â€“3 years before shaving it all offâ€¦ but now, with this diffuse thinning, it looks like Iâ€™m already there.\nShould I keep hoping itâ€™ll bounce back? Or is it time to just accept it and move on?\n\nI was strongly against finasteride before, but now Iâ€™m honestly starting to wonder if it might be the only option left.\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would really help.",

I already do the pineapple, silk pillow sheets, basically laying like a mummy in bed.\nI usually have to shower in the evening, bc of job and workout reasons and since blowdrying turns my hair into a Tina Turner type of hairstyle (even when using a diffuser) I let it air dry as best as I can before going to bed - I know it's not optimal but currently its the most practical. Even if I do my routine in the morning and let it air dry, my curls mostly look frizzy, undefined and overall bad. I wear my hair down maybe one day per month which is super depressing..\n\nMy current routine:\n- Clarifying or mild shampoo depending on wash day\n- Pantene hair mask, brushing hair at this point with denman brush\n- Rinsing out mask but leaving a bit in\n- Staying in shower, flipping hair over and applying some leave in conditioner as well as gel (currently EcoGel). Scrunching everything in while it feels like seaweed, making sure curl clumps form.\n- Plopping the wet, product treated curls into a microfiber towel, removing towel after 15-20 mins and let air dry\n\nI've noticed that my curls often look super bad at this point already so sometimes I brush them after taking the towel off, to make them a bit easier to manage for braid styles. I can get wavy/slightly curly to quite curly hair depending on how I treat it.\n\nI desperately need any advice I can get. If my hair wouldn't be this frizzy and undefined I think I would have already chopped the majority of it off..",

Like Iâ€™m realizing I have hardly ANY photos of my longer hair dow because it was always pissing me off lol. The short hair is more effortless for me and itâ€™s kinda nice not having the option to worry about different styles. I also love being able to see my earrings. Just of it is, I need unbiased opinions. I canâ€™t decide if I actually want long hair or if Iâ€™m just bored and always want to change things up, or if Iâ€™m just feeling insecure because who doesnâ€™t these days. And Iâ€™m aware that it will be a pain in the ass to grow out and all that jazz.

All the products should have no protein or are too drying.\nThey feel crunchy today but I have decided itâ€™s the gel.. \n\nI am driving home and see the sun passing through my hair only to find what looks like split ends again?!?\nI have cut my hair 4 times. \n\nThis recent time the split ends were completely gone &amp; now theyâ€™ve come back. \nFresh brand new stylist shears.\n\nIs this the gel cast? Did I damage my hair already? Do I need to literally chop all my hair off ? I do NOT want to do it. I have lost so much length \n\nPlease help me ",
