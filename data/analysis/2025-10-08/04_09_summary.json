I love my short hair but some days I hate it, but I remember feeling the same way with long hair and I always wore it up because it annoyed me and I had way fewer good hair days. It’s nice to be able to do different styles with long hair, but I also was tired of wearing it up all the time. Like I’m realizing I have hardly ANY photos of my longer hair dow because it was always pissing me off lol. The short hair is more effortless for me and it’s kinda nice not having the option to worry about different styles. I also love being able to see my earrings. Just of it is, I need unbiased opinions. I can’t decide if I actually want long hair or if I’m just bored and always want to change things up, or if I’m just feeling insecure because who doesn’t these days. And I’m aware that it will be a pain in the ass to grow out and all that jazz. I tried to post photos with variety in lighting but l don’t have a lot.\n\nRoutine:\n\nPattern shampoo and conditioner.\nMielle leave in.\nCurlsmith gel.",

I am sure it is because of the layers, which is unfortunate because I have always said I wanted to grow it out. But in truth, it only seems to get bigger, not longer. \nSo what cut would you advice for me to get so, as it grows out, it can slowly turn into a mixture between both the examples in the second image? I want it to have shape, but very discreetly. So, in an elongated almong type of shape with long layers.\n\nWhat would you guys reccomend?\n\nMy routine:\n\n1. Shampoo scalp and ocassionally bring the lather down the rest of my hair and/or shampoo twice.\n2. Carol's daughter conditioner and detangle with one of those separate bristle brushes.\n3. Rosemary mint oil leave-in conditioner I found at burlington that is my best friend on my ends. Sometimes use rosemary oil on my scalp to stimulate growth.\n4. I use skala on the rest of my hair as a curl cream (I was unaware the leave-in was a leave-in, so it was unintentional but it works so hey)\n5. Use bounce curl brush dupe and divide my hair lazily and brush style.\n6. Either Aunt Jackie's or Camille rose gels and squish it in (Yes, squish, not scrunch. I gently pull the hair down for less shrinkage.)\n7. Air dry.\n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Her hair in the AM is always a mess -  frizzy, knotty, and looks dry. \n\n1- in the morning her hair is always frizzy, if I wet it to try to comb it out with detangler spray… it’s brutal. \n\n2- I was washing her hair once a week, then upped it to every two days, no real improvement. Her bed time routine is at night and she usually goes to bed with wet (ish) hair. \n\n3- When I wash her hair - I shampoo it (wash it out), condition it spray with detangler and tie it up. Before I wash it out I brush the conditioner through (it’s like an Olympic event) then I wash it out. \n\n4- After I lightly towel dry it (and by this point she’s Defcon-5) then spray with frizzease and put her to bed. Tonight I did the same but used cantu curl cream for the first time.  \n\n5- I usually brush it one more time before putting her to bed. \n\nAs a dad I have no idea how to care of long curly hair lol.  I have tried quite a few shampoo and conditioners and the one that seems to soften it the best is (Bellisso Curly Hair Shampoo and conditioner). I’ve tried the Frizzease spray, a few different detangler sprays, and multiple curl creams. There are other times, when I use the blow dryer head-puff-thing (it fills up with air attached to the blow dryer with a hose. It looks like a giant pillow and her hair goes in it) her hair comes out amazing… for a few hours, she’ll still wake up the next day with wild hair. ",

      "content": "So for the past like 2 years I’ve been wondering what the hell has been going on with my hair. It went from very easily defined and highly dense curls to the suggestion of a curl ish wave and shedding more than it ever had in my life. I had lost a substantial amount of weight but in a very healthy way and had overall objectively increased healthy behaviors as well, and the only times my hair had straightened out or shed was when I was very sick with a restrictive eating disorder so I was very confused. Well, found out recently that my birth control was actually totally screwing with my estrogen levels and had caused two large lesions on my liver, essentially taking up half the thing. And when the bloodwork marker that led us to this began to creep up higher and higher? That’s when my hair started changing. I’ve always known my hair was very sensitive to my health, but for some reason this didn’t occur to me this time. So this is your friendly reminder that if your hair suddenly and drastically changes in any way, talk to a doctor! Get some blood and hormone panels done!!\n\nRoutine (currently, R)\nAveeno thickening shampoo \nSkala maracuja 2 in 1 \nSkala as styler or Innersense products ",

I've an oily face and my hair gets ugly quickly which means my hairstyle is always a sleek pony tail or braid.\n\nI also exercise everyday and can't have hair all over my face, best I can do is have those strands of hair in my face like Lara croft and that looks good temporarily before it gets oiled up. \n\n(For my face I use CeraVe blemish cleanser which removes the excess oil for a few hours before it comes back)(That was prescribed by my dermatologist)\n\n\nWhen it comes to getting a haircut it gets more nightmarish...\nI need textured styling with waves and soft framing layers but my hair is STRAIGHT and I've tried everything to make it wavy and nothing works for too long. (I don't even want to talk about hairspray...)\nOnly braiding my hair works to create waves for one two hours or before I bathe or brush my hair.\n\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\n✓ I've a square face = I need hair in my face to create a face framing effect and avoid geometric sharp symmetry \n X I've a greasy face and that means: \nNo bangs no fringe no face framing no nothing \n\n✓ I need textured styling, layers, wavy hair \n X I've a REALLY stubborn straight hair \n\n! Avoid using ponytails and sleek hairstyles \n X That's the only thing I can use when I exercise and helps with the oily face issue plus I've too much hair and it's hot here\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nSquare face + Straight hair + oily face + oily hair        \nIs downright an EVIL combination even more with a hot weather.\n\nI've been dealing with this my whole life and the solutions have been short lasting ones...I would really really appreciate if someone could help me with advices a about a haircut and hairstyle that could work please ♥️\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, after a pregnancy and major surgery I lost A LOT of hair and the hair that's growing back is wavy/curly (you can see in the pictures the bottom layer vs top layer). So right now I got a mix, and up until last week I've been using a hair straightener to \"fix\" it or I've been just keeping it up most of the time. I barely had to use a straightener before and now I'm using it at least once a week, but I'm kinda tired of it and want to be able to just keep my hair's natural type. The thing is I don't know how to take care of it as it is right now, and I'm overwhelmed by the amount of information and products out there. Is there anyone that can help me at least with a basic routine to try every wash until I get the hang of it? I'm willing to buy products and test things out, I just don't know where to start.\n\nMy routine so far has been: I use function of beauty shampoo and conditioner (which has been for straight hair but I've requested to change the formula for the next delivery), wash twice, conditioner, rinse, brush it, let it air dry and call it a day, 2x/week. Then once a day before brushing I use a couple drops of olaplex n7 bonding oil. ",
