Like I’m realizing I have hardly ANY photos of my longer hair dow because it was always pissing me off lol. The short hair is more effortless for me and it’s kinda nice not having the option to worry about different styles. I also love being able to see my earrings. Just of it is, I need unbiased opinions. I can’t decide if I actually want long hair or if I’m just bored and always want to change things up, or if I’m just feeling insecure because who doesn’t these days.

Her hair in the AM is always a mess -  frizzy, knotty, and looks dry. \n\n1- in the morning her hair is always frizzy, if I wet it to try to comb it out with detangler spray… it’s brutal. \n\n2- I was washing her hair once a week, then upped it to every two days, no real improvement. Her bed time routine is at night and she usually goes to bed with wet (ish) hair. \n\n3- When I wash her hair - I shampoo it (wash it out), condition it spray with detangler and tie it up. Before I wash it out I brush the conditioner through (it’s like an Olympic event) then I wash it out. \n\n4- After I lightly towel dry it (and by this point she’s Defcon-5) then spray with frizzease and put her to bed. Tonight I did the same but used cantu curl cream for the first time.  \n\n5- I usually brush it one more time before putting her to bed. \n\nAs a dad I have no idea how to care of long curly hair lol.  I have tried quite a few shampoo and conditioners and the one that seems to soften it the best is (Bellisso Curly Hair Shampoo and conditioner). I’ve tried the Frizzease spray, a few different detangler sprays, and multiple curl creams. There are other times, when I use the blow dryer head-puff-thing (it fills up with air attached to the blow dryer with a hose. It looks like a giant pillow and her hair goes in it) her hair comes out amazing… for a few hours, she’ll still wake up the next day with wild hair. ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

But now I since I'm seeing it *slowly* but *barely* making any progress in listening to gravity and falling flatter. I am sure it is because of the layers, which is unfortunate because I have always said I wanted to grow it out. But in truth, it only seems to get bigger, not longer. \nSo what cut would you advice for me to get so, as it grows out, it can slowly turn into a mixture between both the examples in the second image? I want it to have shape, but very discreetly. So, in an elongated almong type of shape with long layers.\n\nWhat would you guys reccomend?\n\nMy routine:\n\n1. Shampoo scalp and ocassionally bring the lather down the rest of my hair and/or shampoo twice.\n2. Carol's daughter conditioner and detangle with one of those separate bristle brushes.\n3. Rosemary mint oil leave-in conditioner I found at burlington that is my best friend on my ends. Sometimes use rosemary oil on my scalp to stimulate growth.\n4. I use skala on the rest of my hair as a curl cream (I was unaware the leave-in was a leave-in, so it was unintentional but it works so hey)\n5. Use bounce curl brush dupe and divide my hair lazily and brush style.\n6. Either Aunt Jackie's or Camille rose gels and squish it in (Yes, squish, not scrunch. I gently pull the hair down for less shrinkage.)\n7. Air dry.\n",

      "title": "Severe diffuse thinning after scalp inflammation – should I keep fighting or just accept it?",
      "content": "Hey guys,\nI’m 23 and started my hair loss treatment about 6 months ago (topical minoxidil once a day, dermarolling once a week, and Nizoral twice a week). I was around a Norwood 2.5 when I began, and things actually went great at first — solid regrowth and stabilization.\n\nThen, around month 4, my scalp started getting itchy, red, and irritated. At first, I ignored it because my hair was still looking better. But later, the shedding became massive. At first, I thought it was just a second shed, but the timing felt off. My scalp started to actually hurt when touching it, so I switched from liquid min to foam. Sadly, nothing improved — the inflammation stayed, and the hair loss became insane.\n\nAfter a while, I decided to stop minoxidil completely, even the foam. It’s been about a month off now, and my scalp still hasn’t fully recovered. I’ve seen a dermatologist who prescribed me anti-inflammatory meds, and I’m hoping that helps.\n\nBut here’s my real question:\nDo hairs that fall out due to scalp inflammation (and not DHT) actually regrow once the inflammation is gone? Because right now my density is terrible. My hairline didn’t recede that much, but overall my scalp is clearly visible.\n\nI used to think I’d be able to keep my hair for another 2–3 years before shaving it all off… but now, with this diffuse thinning, it looks like I’m already there.\nShould I keep hoping it’ll bounce back? Or is it time to just accept it and move on?\n\nI was strongly against finasteride before, but now I’m honestly starting to wonder if it might be the only option left.\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would really help.",

However, after a pregnancy and major surgery I lost A LOT of hair and the hair that's growing back is wavy/curly (you can see in the pictures the bottom layer vs top layer). So right now I got a mix, and up until last week I've been using a hair straightener to \"fix\" it or I've been just keeping it up most of the time. I barely had to use a straightener before and now I'm using it at least once a week, but I'm kinda tired of it and want to be able to just keep my hair's natural type. The thing is I don't know how to take care of it as it is right now, and I'm overwhelmed by the amount of information and products out there. Is there anyone that can help me at least with a basic routine to try every wash until I get the hang of it? I'm willing to buy products and test things out, I just don't know where to start.\n\nMy routine so far has been: I use function of beauty shampoo and conditioner (which has been for straight hair but I've requested to change the formula for the next delivery), wash twice, conditioner, rinse, brush it, let it air dry and call it a day, 2x/week. Then once a day before brushing I use a couple drops of olaplex n7 bonding oil. ",
