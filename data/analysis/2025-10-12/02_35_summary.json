      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I use color-safe hair products and rarely ever use heat on my hair (but I do tend to take hot showers). \n\nAnd yes, I know permanent dye or even semi-permanent would be longer lasting than demi. I choose to go demi because I find it fades a lot more naturally so my roots (neutral brown hair) don’t show as drastically. The second photo is how it faded last time into a nice deep brown!

      "content": "Essentially, I found that my hair was frizzy when wet and still dry after using different conditioners so I decided that a deep conditioner would be the route to go. So a lot of people recommended Alikay Naturals Honey and Sage deep conditioner. I even used a heat cap with it and after using it for weeks, there was no difference. I then realized that it contained protein in it which may be the issue but I'm not sure. Based off my research, there could be a protein imbalance issue but I'm not sure if I need more or less, though I'd assume less. Would my next step be trying a deep conditioner without protein thats suitable for my hair? I'm not sure so any feedback is appreciated.\n\nIn regards to my hair and routine:\nMy hair is low porosity and I believe its on the finer side, 3a/3b I'd describe it. Currently I'm using Jessicurl Gentle Lather Shampoo then Natural Sage deep conditioner. After that I apply Kinky Curly Knot today leave in and then Jojoba oil. I feel its worth noting that I've never used a chelating shampoo. Any help in regards to routine would also be greaty appreciated. Thank you :)",

I have changed hair products A LOT and have dyed my hair many times, but since taken a break. I am currently using the Native brand and Soapbox brand for shampoo and conditioner. I had their sprays too, but after some research I found a lot of people were dealing with thinning and frizz. I too.. am dealing with thinning and frizz. For extra moisture I use the soapbox brand too. I’ll put shea oil in my hair on extra frizzy days. \n\nDuring 2021 I used Cantu, but they’ve changed their recipe sooo much over the years and I can’t rely on that anymore. I cannot recall what I was using for shampoo and conditioner, but I honestly think it was Dove shampoo and Suave. I feel like my hair was so much fuller and bouncier in 2021! \n\nExtra info: I air dry my hair and do not blow dry at all. I sleep with a bonnet sometimes and use a silk pillow case ALWAYS. I do not go to bed with wet hair. \n\nWhat should I do? Go back to the basic routine even though they’re full of sulfates or try something new again? I think a hair cut is due for starters. ",

So anyways, my washdays are rarely ever good, and never really end well. SO that's why I got to the \"Reddit is my only chance of success\" level of hair. So if anyone can tell me how to fix this HEAP OF DEFORMED RAMEN on my head, that would be awesome.\n\n\n\nHere's some info and a routine:\n\n\n\nHair Type: 3A, 3C\n\nPreferences: Volume and Definition, Shine\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Current Routine (wash day):\n\nI start with using the Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Defrizzing Shampoo. I coat my hair in this PURE LIQUID GOLD.\n\n  \n(Warning, Unknown Product) Then I use the Arvensis 2x1 Hair Mask for Coily and Kinky Hair. I distribute it throughout my hair and use my Tangle Teezer to get it everywhere. Then I clip it into a bun using 2 mini claw clips on each side, then let it sit for about 7 to 10 minutes.\n\nAfter, I rinse it out and use the Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Defrizzing Conditioner and get the final knots outs with my Tangle Teezer.\n\nThen, once done, I wrap my hair in a microfiber towel and get ready.\n\nAfter, I usually add a leave in or a curl cream. Usually, I'll use the Morrocan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream. However, if I need extra moisture, I would use the Aunt Jackie's quench! Moisture Intensive Leave-In Conditioner.\n\nI'll add the Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Gel after that.\n\nFor a more natural look, I'll add either the BIOSILK Silk Therapy Beach Texture Spray or the FOXYBAE Beach, Please Sea Salt Texturizing Spray.\n\nAfter, I use my Dyson Diffuser until there is NO wetness whatsoever and then pick a random hair oil from my collection.\n\nI let my hair stay in the bonnet for a bit, and then voila! Beautiful hair that lasts only  for a day! \n\nPLEASE HELP\n\n  \n\n\n",

I’m trying to find moisturizing products that will maintain and strengthen my skin barrier without clogging my pores or causing breakouts. I’m open to learning about lighter morning moisturizers, thicker overnight moisturizers, hydrating face masks etc. please help me! I want to glow!\n\nCurrent skin:\n\nI have very sensitive dry/ combination skin with all types of texture and acne. I mainly struggle with cystic hormonal acne on my chin, jaw, and cheeks (probably due to my IUD), but also have sebaceous filaments and blackheads on my nose, bumpy texture on my chin, and have the occasional bacterial breakout. (I guess the only thing I’m missing is fungal acne haha knock on wood).\n\n•\t⁠La Roche Posay Toleraine Hydrating Gentle Cleanser (AM and PM)\n•\t⁠15% Azelaic acid (AM) (except, I am waiting on a refill right now so I’m using 10% Naturium Azelaic Topical as a placeholder)\n•\t⁠Erythromycin 2% topical gel (PM)\n•\t⁠La Roche Posay Toleraine Double Repair Face Moisturizer (AM and PM)\n•\t⁠La Roche Posay Anthelios Ultra Light Fluid Sunscreen (AM)\n•\t⁠Just added De La Cruz Sulfur Acne Treatment mask (starting with every 2-3 nights)\n•\t⁠Just added Celimax Ji Woo Gae Hartleaf BHA Peeling Pads (starting with 1-2 times a week\n- (I also just bought the Naturium Barrier Bounce today and haven’t used it yet but I’m scared it might break me out bc of the shea butter)",

My hair is flat, lost all its curl etc. \n\nI’ve recently purchased the attached ORANGE products to test- but I’m wondering how good/bad they will actually be? \n\nFor context:\nMy hair is thigh length\nI don’t use any sort of heat on it\nIt spends more time in a bun than anything because it’s so long \nI wash it every 14 days (it used to be around every 6 weeks because I spent YEARS training it to get to that point, but I’ve recently started doing it every 2 weeks and trying to wear it out more. My hair seems to like being washed every 2 weeks and is barely oily on wash day) \nAfter washing, I will wrap it up in a cotton towel while I get dry and dressed, and then I’ll just take it out and let it air dry throughout the day \nI don’t wear any hair accessories etc (other than a simple hair tie) \nI do usually double shampoo only my scalp, and then condition only the lengths. \nI do brush it dry. \n\nThankyou! \n\nOriginal routine (for the algorithm)\nShampoo: the blue John Frieda attached\nConditioner: the blue John Frieda attached \nOther products: none usually.
