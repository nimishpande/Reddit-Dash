      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

But over the past year, her skin has noticeably worsened, it looks duller, with uneven texture and small breakouts that she never had before.\n\nA few weeks ago she went for a professional facial/cleaning, but it didn’t go very well — her skin broke out afterward with red pimples and hasn’t really recovered since.\n\nShe feels lost about where to start now and would love to rebuild a proper skincare routine. Could you please help us figure out a simple, effective plan, ideally with some product recommendations (brands too, if possible)?\n\nShe’s looking for advice on:\n\n* A gentle cleanser\n* A good moisturizer\n* Daily sunscreen\n* Something to help with texture and prevent new breakouts\n\nHer skin type seems to be normal to combination, it wasn’t sensitive before, but has become more reactive lately.\n\nThank you all so much in advance for your help and guidance 🙏",

I start by detangling my hair a bit with my hands after wetting it, then I wash my hair with Aveeno apple cider vinegar shampoo clarifying shampoo, before I condition with redken all soft conditioner, and detangle fully with a wet brush, I brush my hair to the opposite side to which I wear it on, add my leave in conditioner (Marc Anthony Grow Long) and a small small amount of coconut and shea curl cream, I brush it through then I use my styling brush (I don’t bother sectioning because I only have hair on top anyway) I spray with heat protectant then diffuse most of the way, spray with a bit more morrocan oil and wear a bonnet for 15 minutes (seems to help me with frizz) then take it off and let it fully dry.",

Anyways, I have fine, low porosity 3a/3b hair that I have been growing out from a buzz cut for about a year. My routine consists of washing about every 3-4 days with conditioner (Shea Moisture coconut &amp; hibiscus, it worked for me for ages) and once weekly with shampoo (random store brand), and styling just with a curl cream (John Frieda Frizz Ease) and letting it air dry. For a while, I was fairly happy with my curls; they were defined, lasted a couple of days and held in place, but I felt they were a little dry and too tangled, so I decided to opt for a leave-in, which was a mistake.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I got a Cantu repair leave-in with Shea butter (bad for fine hair, I figured it out too late) and I used it ONCE, just a bit on my finger and then finger-combed through hair, and since then my hair has been an absolute disaster. \n\nAfter my hair dried, I noticed that it had, in fact, made my hair very soft but also loosened up my curl pattern, reduced definition and created a lot of soft, straightish, and sort of floaty frizz. Additionally, in the shower instead of clumping in big, drenched, wet curls, my hair remains frizzy and just sort of damp (it feels oddly not wet enough for now, long it has been soaking). I also feel like I have been shedding more, but that might be just the looser curl not catching the shed hairs as well as before.\n\nSo, my question is, what is happening and what can I do? I stopped using all products for two weeks and only clarified but I see little to no improvement. I read about protein and moisture overloads, both of which are readily available in the Cantu product, but the information on the internet seems super contradictory, and I don't want to damage my hair further. I tried the stretch test, but I can't figure out how to prevent my hair from just slipping out of whatever I use to hold it, haha, it's just so fine and smooth.\n\nAny and all advice and experience is welcome. I attached a couple of pictures of my hair now, a day after clarifying. Day 1 frizz is not that bad but the straightish flyaways in the first picture could give a good idea what appears all over my head during days 2 and 3. Unfortunately, I have no before images. Thanks, everyone.",

      "content": "I started taking topical minoxidil 6 years ago and had decent results at slowing down the hair loss but wanted to totally stop the hairloss and potentially regrow a little so 1.5 years ago I switched to hims topical minoxidil/finasteride spray. Since then my hair has continued to recede and thin out. looks worse than when I was only using minoxidil but i cant say fin actuallymade it worse. Could be more that fin just didnt do anything helpful and my hair loss naturally continued.   But either way I cant really  justify paying the money for something that isn't doing much of anything. \n\nMy own theory is that simply less minoxidil caused my  hair to get worse.  The min/fin spray is only once a day and using the recommend 4 spray pumps once a day lets me make the bottle last until the next one arrives, so no option to use it more often unless i want to pay even more than i am now. I think no longer using minoxidil both day and night was enough to make things worse. I could keep using the min/fin once a day and add only minoxidil back in the mornings but for cost reasons and considering i havent seen any benefits from adding fin, id rather juat not use it at all. would like to just go back to using minoxidil only.\n\nI get that min is the fertilizer and fin is the pesticide or whatever that farming analogy is that everyone loves to use, but wondering if switching back to only min causes increased hair loss and thinning based on anyone's experience.  To sum it up... am I stuck paying for and using fin forever to avoid any negative effects of stopping the topical fin",

Some clarification just in case:\n\n-I would only use the oil cleanser at night\n- I’d only use the Vit C serum during the day\n- Eye gel I would use at night \n- The retinol would be a couple times a week to start\n\nSo again my question is, are any of these products not safe to use with another? A lot of these I’ve seen part of a routine for many women on TikTok (I know that’s not the most reliable source of info but it’s where I looked) and there wasn’t much talk about not mixing this with that, but someone mentioned it once about some other product so it occurred to me that I should make sure these are all safe to use together (and respectively to day and night stuff).
