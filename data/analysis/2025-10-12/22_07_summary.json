I’ve had these intense dark circles basically since birth, and the last photo of me at 2 or 3 years old shows the same thing—those same purple undereyes. I’ve tried so many eye creams over the years, from vitamin C to arnica to caffeine, and nothing seems to help. I know it’s genetic, but I’m also dealing with other factors like low iron and allergies. It's been pointed out to me my entire life, even by doctors. The weird thing is, I don’t feel like my undereyes are super hollow. There’s a bit of hollowness, but I’m not sure it’s enough to explain the discoloration. I’m really stumped and would love to hear if anyone has suggestions for what might help. I’m curious about options like PDGF, lasers, or anything that could potentially make a long-term difference. (And I know allergy and iron pills too, which do help some but not enough)",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "I’m 32 years old, my father is bald and my maternal grandfather was bald, so I knew from early age I would end up bald. At first I tried vitamins, ketoconazole shampoo when I was 22 to have more hair (I wasn’t balding then but my hair grew slowly) with no effect.\n\nWhen I became 31 I started balding fast. I couldn’t stand it (it made me look way older, and my chewing muscles are big so I look like the Alien from the Alien franchise when balding). I partially accepted it, kept my hair super short but having hair grow in your sidelines and not in the top of my head made me look terribly.\n\nI started dut/min october 2024, and I have kept it since then. I share some pictures of my progress. I use dutasteride 0,5 mg orally once daily, and minoxidil once daily (it should be twice daily, but I frequently forget to use it at night). I didn’t feel any difference in the first month and thought about quitting, but my friends said I had new baby hair and there was a mild noticeable change, so I kept going and that was the right choice.\n\nAs for side effects, my libido has decreased a little, the erections have remained the same, and my semen is more watery (and more abundant, at least something good). \n\nMy plan is to save money to have a hair transplant. I’m unsure if I should do it first in the back zone or the front zone, I’ll decide later. They’re expensive anyways so I’ll have time to decide.\n\nI decided to post this to help someone in the same position I was. I was really unsure of starting treatment or not, I searched for advice and other people’s experiences, so this might be a grain of salt for someone. ",

I start by detangling my hair a bit with my hands after wetting it, then I wash my hair with Aveeno apple cider vinegar shampoo clarifying shampoo, before I condition with redken all soft conditioner, and detangle fully with a wet brush, I brush my hair to the opposite side to which I wear it on, add my leave in conditioner (Marc Anthony Grow Long) and a small small amount of coconut and shea curl cream, I brush it through then I use my styling brush (I don’t bother sectioning because I only have hair on top anyway) I spray with heat protectant then diffuse most of the way, spray with a bit more morrocan oil and wear a bonnet for 15 minutes (seems to help me with frizz) then take it off and let it fully dry.",

Since I started using the Vanicream moisturizer and washing my face with just water in the monring, my skin feels less dehydrated, but it still doesn’t feel fully hydrated on its own. My skin also looks very dull and have hyperpigmentation from the acne.\n\nOverall, I’m happy with my current routine — I’ve been following it for about four months, and PanOxyl has been an absolute game changer for my breakouts. Also, I live in Canada, where the climate is very dry.\n\nHere’s my current routine:\n\n**Morning**\n\n* Wash with water (occasionally use the CeraVe Foaming Cleanser)\n* Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer\n* Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum\n\nHypochlorous acid spray in between\n\n**Evening**\n\n* PanOxyl 4% wash (two times a week) or Cerave cleanser\n* Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer\n\nI've used both the Cerave lotion and moisturizing cream are okay but my skin sometimes feels irritated and heavy after using them. I've used niacinamide before and I suspect it breaks me out, so products without that would be great!\n\nI would appreciate any suggestions for additions to my routine to help!",

And due to this, they were hotly contested / debated. People seemed to think it was basic brand korean skincare being marketed to the gullible west.\n\nSince then, however, influencers I trust appear to be banging on about Medicube PDRN series without being paid: \n\n– Paige Desorbo mentioned she loves the pink collagen mask (and the electric thingy)  \n– Tana Mongeau basically said she would get a subscribe and save to the pink collagen masks \n\nMultiple others that I can't remember now or point at. \n\nI've got them and I've been using the Pink Collagen Masks and the Serum. My Mum keeps asking what I'm doing to my skin and it looks amazing after I use the products. Weirdly, I don't seem to notice much difference... but I'm still using them. What's everyone's opinion? Has anyone noticed significant results?\n\nI've used the wrapping mask... I don't really have a verdict. Seems very messy for something an emollient would do. I'd love to hear other people's opinions or tips on how to use it for maximum effect. \n\nThe electric thing I don't have, but I'd trust Paige Desorbo's recommendations with my life and she seems to love it? Has anyone used it, loved it, and if so what products did you pair it with and how did it fit into your routine? ",

      "content": "I started taking topical minoxidil 6 years ago and had decent results at slowing down the hair loss but wanted to totally stop the hairloss and potentially regrow a little so 1.5 years ago I switched to hims topical minoxidil/finasteride spray. Since then my hair has continued to recede and thin out. looks worse than when I was only using minoxidil but i cant say fin actuallymade it worse. Could be more that fin just didnt do anything helpful and my hair loss naturally continued.   But either way I cant really  justify paying the money for something that isn't doing much of anything. \n\nMy own theory is that simply less minoxidil caused my  hair to get worse.  The min/fin spray is only once a day and using the recommend 4 spray pumps once a day lets me make the bottle last until the next one arrives, so no option to use it more often unless i want to pay even more than i am now. I think no longer using minoxidil both day and night was enough to make things worse. I could keep using the min/fin once a day and add only minoxidil back in the mornings but for cost reasons and considering i havent seen any benefits from adding fin, id rather juat not use it at all. would like to just go back to using minoxidil only.\n\nI get that min is the fertilizer and fin is the pesticide or whatever that farming analogy is that everyone loves to use, but wondering if switching back to only min causes increased hair loss and thinning based on anyone's experience.  To sum it up... am I stuck paying for and using fin forever to avoid any negative effects of stopping the topical fin",

I used the mielle curl smoothie and let it sit on my head overnight to try to start a new routine to get the stupid curls back the hairstylist cut out. Does this already look better to y'all? \n\nPlease no fat comments. Please no comments about my job either if you recognize the uniform. It gets hurtful I'm working on both. My face was REALLY irritated after my shift the day I took the before pic.\n\nIdk what else to do I'm trying not to wash it as often. My sis said once a week only but that feels Abit long with my hair being both oily and dry. (More dry than oily now so using coconut shampoo to moisturize it)\n\nI used before and after tag but idk if it should actually be \"help!\" \n\nThis is nowhere close to the style it should have been it's almost if not exactly 3 inches shorter than I told her to cut.",
