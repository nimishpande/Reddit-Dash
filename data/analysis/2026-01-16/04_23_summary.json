      "content": "hey guys! since my last post i’ve been getting a lot of dms/comments asking about my routine, so i thought i’d just address everything in one post🫶\n\ni did mention my current routine in the previous post, but i really want to clarify something important: that is NOT how i started my taz journey. please don’t jump straight into that 😭\n\neven though my skin was already familiar with retinoids (i’d been on adapalene + an SA cleanser for \\~5 months), i **cut out ALL actives** for a full month when i started taz.\n\nit was literally:  \n**me + taz + moisturiser vs the world.**\n\ni only used **taz twice a week** and focused entirely on barrier support.\n\n# how i started (first month):\n\n**AM:**\n\n* dot &amp; key barrier face wash\n* cosrx snail mucin (on damp skin)\n* Aquasoft AC moisturiser\n* sunscreen\n\n**PM:**\n\n* dot &amp; key barrier face wash\n* aestura lotion\n* **taz ONLY on monday &amp; thursday**\n\nthat’s it. no acids, no niacinamide, no “just one exfoliant.” nothing.\n\nplease **do NOT** start tret, taz, or even adapalene without proper dermatologist guidance. they can seriously mess up your skin if used incorrectly.(loot up what tret did to me🙃)\n\nand even *with* a derm’s okay, **do your own research**. read studies, read experiences here on reddit, understand side effects, and what barrier damage actually looks like. don’t blindly copy routines (including mine).\n\ni really can’t emphasize this enough:  \n**starting slowly + using a GOOD moisturiser is non-negotiable.**  \nno retinoid will work if your barrier is wrecked.\n\nalso, full disclosure; at that time i was studying for my university final exams, so i was basically in my dark dorm room all day with little to no sun exposure. that definitely helped too 😅\n\n**honorable mention:**  \nlater on, i read about diaper rash creams on reddit and started using b4 nappi cream on nights i wasn’t using taz to strengthen my barrier.\n\nand yeah… that stuff is the shit.\n\ni still get ONE painful hormonal cyst around my nose area near my period that lasts \\~2 weeks and leaves PIH forever. recently i discovered that if i apply a thick layer of diaper cream before it even fully forms (when you can just feel it under the skin), it goes away in 2 days with zero PIH. absolute game changer for me.\n\nso just to be clear again:  \ni added **all other actives VERY slowly, one by one**, and even now, on **taz nights i use nothing except moisturiser.**\n\nplease be patient with retinoids and protect your barrier. slow progress &gt;&gt;&gt; damaged skin 🫶",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Most of the acne starting to stabilize at this point.---\n\nAM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* The Ordinary Azelaic Acid\n* Japanese or Korean Sunscreen\n\nPM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* SKIN1004 Soothing Cream\n* AcneFree Adapalene Gel\n\n\\---I moved to Ordinary Azelaic Acid after Cos De BAHA and didn't really notice a huge difference with either. The Vanicream was my holy grail for like a year and I randomly picked up the SKIN1004 at Costco because it was on sale. I stocked up and use that a lot now. I also picked up Torriden Dive In Soothing Cream when Costco had it on sale. I like both of these over the Vanicream. I gave up on Azelaic Acid and trying Vitamin C now.---\n\nAM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* Timeless Vitamin C\n* Japanese or Korean Sunscreen\n\nPM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* Torriden Dive In Soothing Cream\n* AcneFree Adapalene Gel\n\n\\---My current sunscreens are Thank You Farmer Green one that I also got from Costco sale and really like for travel because small bottle, but my favorite would be Nivea and Skin Aqua. Both affordable and feels great, but big bottle hard to travel with. I recently switched the Timeless to Good Molecule Discoloration Serum to help get rid of my PIH/PIE.---\n\nI'm really happy with where my skin looks and feels, but always open to recommendations/critiques/feedback/etc. My goal is to get less PIH/PIE. I still get the occasional random white head. I also want everything to look more smooth? I guess part of my alcohol addiction transferred to skincare. Lol.\n\nExtra information:\n\n* I think I'm combination. Oily T zone throughout the day and dry-ish C zone\n* Never thought I had sensitive skin\n* Avoid sun\n* Live in Southern California (dry climate)\n* Change pillowcase every 2-3 days\n* Wash towels and face towels every 2-3 day\n* Plenty of exercise and healthy diet\n* No processed foods, minimal dairy, etc.",

My hair looks pretty good despite a little bit of frizz after wash day and styling. But, literally the next day and the days after, my hair is more frizzy, curly patterns are less defined/turn wonky, and my roots become straight with less volume. When my hair becomes like this, I'm forced to wear braids, buns, and comb the hair for it look to ook presentable. I've had straight roots and a middle part for a pretty long time and want to fix this. Also, can anyone help me figure out what my curl pattern is?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4y72ohmjldg1.jpg?width=1576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dc6e48cb77dcfd235d9e9b3dcc3d458ca26c58f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mh82ohmjldg1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=516527da3ec3133cfdad6ca1eb4c7c902017a648\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhycpuhmjldg1.jpg?width=1576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ada3b6f2f0af744f6955dc6246025fee46ac3190\n\nFYI: I have silk pillowcases but don't use them often, don't own a bonnet, and am not open to cutting my hair atm. \n\n  \nHere's my current routine: \n\n\\- Wash hair once a week and refresh after 4 or 5 days. \n\n\\- shampoo: Cantu cream cleansing shampoo + Pantene daily moisture renewal (for double shampooing) \n\n\\-conditioner: shea moisture deep conditioner and shea moisture deep moisturizing masque (occasionally) \n\n\\-styling: Marc Anthony strictly curls lotion in prayer hands motion from hair at ears to ends, dippity doo curl-boosting mousse to roots, and the rest on hair with prayer hands application, and Ampro pro-style olive oil gel applying in praying hand motion and scrunching excess into roots.

In recent years, they’ve appeared very lightly on my inner thighs but most importantly… on my buttocks 🫩🙃 (This area is the most affected IMO. It doesn’t hurt nor does it look THAT gross, but it got MUCH more visible out of nowhere). After some months of researching, I can be certain of it being Keratosis Pilaris.\n\nI have zero idea of what products I should use, especially because most forums are US/EU-based and some of the products they recommend are either unavailable in my country or much more expensive. I know it might ironic that I ask on here since (and IN ENGLISH) but I couldn’t find a Mexican forum for skincare only 😅\n\nSo if any of you are from MX/LatAm or know about any product for Keratosis Pilaris I can access to in here it would be of great help!\n\nBy the way— should I use the same products for every part of my body? Or does it depend on the area?",

The finacea did help, getting less.\n\nI however am still getting white heads so I started applying CeraVe acne control cleanser (2% salicylic acid acne treatment) every night on top of finacea. Is that overkill? Is having both of those products applied redundant?\n\nI was still getting white heads so then I started applying CeraVe foaming facial cleanser 2x/day but that feels like it made it worse.\n\nI have dry skin, especially bad during winter months.  I’ve been aveeno baby cream on my face but still feels somewhat dry and not sure if that makes the white heads worse.\n\nProducts Used:\n\nfinacea 15% gel (azelaic acid)\n\nCeraVe acne control cleanser (2% salicylic acid acne treatment)\n\nCeraVe foaming facial cleanser\n\nAveeno baby cream \n\nI would really appreciate any advice and feedback on my skincare regiment/ products.\n\nThank you",
