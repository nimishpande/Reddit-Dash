It got to a certain point that it would burn to put even just water on my face. The first two photos are from April from when my acne was at its worst. I started Doxycycline for a month in May before starting Accutane June. I ended up only doing 3 months of Accutane due to the severity of the back pain. The third and forth photos are from August and the last photo is from a few days ago before I did my makeup!\n\nI have been keeping my skincare routine pretty consistent through the year since i’m a little afraid to add new products in my routine.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

When my hair becomes like this, I'm forced to wear braids, buns, and comb the hair for it look to ook presentable.

      "title": "[Acne] Normal to dry skin, help needed with forehead bumps that appeared quickly. Removed suspected triggers, but no improvement over a month later.",
      "content": "TLDR- normal/dry skin somewhat prone to ccs, got on with neutrogena gel and curel intensive moisture historically. I \\*suspect\\* film-formy sunscreens induced forehead CC explosion. Can’t get rid of it despite ceased use. \n\n\n\nI (25f) have normal-dehydrated/slightly dry skin. (Skin feels tight after cleansing or getting my face wet and the water drying off, but no dry patches, and I never seem to get oily (but my face sweats a lot).) I get hormonal spots around my mouth and usually have mild ccs on my forehead that come and go a little (better in the summer etc). \n\nNever been very consistent with skincare - for a year or two I was using \n\n\\- Neutrogena hydroboost water gel moisturiser and Superdrug me+ Salicylic acid cleanser, a few times a week (basically on hair wash days). Skin was pretty clear/good here. \n\n\\- Then I switched to curel intensive moisture cream as my moisturiser, used with similar frequency. I used it with beautyformulas HA moisturising serum. Found it a bit thick but did get on with it and skin was good. used for quite a while (long enough to replace a few times).\n\n\\- Then introduced spf - goodal heartleaf calming sun cream. Did not use as consistently or for as long as I should have, but frequently enough over late summer. Made my skin so beautiful in the mornings but I \\*think\\* I remember feeling a little bit more forehead texture as I put it on over time.\n\n\\- Then started using Rohto Skin Aqua (blue bottle) in like late November, because Goodal got compromised by being left open and I had it already from a YesStyle order. Used it almost daily for not very long at all, still using the SA cleanser as always, and I noticed a total explosion of tiny ccs on my forehead.\n\n\\- Stopped using Rohto \n\n\\-  Decided to go back to Neutrogena hydroboost water gel. I now find it not moisturising enough, ie I can actually feel TEWL after it dries down (I put on damp skin and use the HA serum on damp skin first). Ive stopped using the SA cleanser so often as well as of last week, fearing it’s not helping my barrier. \n\n\n\nNow it’s been over a month since I stopped skin Aqua (didn’t replace with any spf), and I’ve seen no improvement to the ccs apart from a slight initial calming maybe. I resisted the urge to introduce any actives, apart from TO lactic acid 5% like twice. \n\nIn the mornings now my skin looks glowy and plump, and ccs appear much flatter and minimal. Throughout the day though they gradually look worse, awful texture when I check at night.\n\nChatgpt suggested my skin doesn’t appreciate fatty esters and film forming occlusion. I just haven’t seen any improvement after stopping those sunscreens and the Curel, so not sure what to think. I’m also considering whether it could possibly be fungal acne? They’re on both my temples too, a little into my hairline, and don’t really itch but I can feel they’re there if that makes sense.\n\n\n\nI think maybe I should go back to Curel because it historically worked, and I think my barrier now needs it. Could this help the ccs, or will any heavier occlusion just make it worse? I feel pretty lost and anxious tbh. So scared of now making the wrong move and product hopping - but I’m really not enjoying Neutrogena anymore, it’s not enough for me now. \n\nOther details I can think of:\n\n* I use a random rotation of shampoo and conditioners, so nothing specific changed in that regard \n* Same with laundry detergents \n* I work in a kitchen where I have to wear a hairnet and a baseball cap but have done for a long time \n\nI wish I could be more specific with timelines but sadly I don’t remember things like that and foolishly didn’t make notes. Sorry for the long post!",

I was looking for a u shape and layers.. so yes. I did it at home because there’s like no curly salons in my area. I was stressing so much at this time that i cut a bunch of hair off without even realizing it. I lost my good volume. My hair is now in the u shape but without my thick hair it looks a hot mess I have no idea what to do!! Will it even grow back? Like how long will this take? I keep looking back at the moment and i have so much regret. I feel like i lost all the volume and thickness at the crown of my hair. \n\nAnyways since my routine is needed i use Camille rose leave in, the doux mousse, and my beloved honey dip doux gel! (My holy grail🫰🏽🫰🏽)\n\n\n(First pic is before i cut💔💔 Second is now…)",

I liked the convenience of it being delivered to me, but I know I've been overpaying and would like some alternatives! \n\nThe exfoliant is 8% glycolic acid, so thats an AHA right? Do I even need an AHA at this point? Do I need a BHA? \n\nI'd also be open to product recs for moisturizers!

(this one specifically helps me a lot)\n\neveryone’s skin is different, and obviously formulation matters a lot too. this is in no way medical or professional advice, this is just what i think would be a good starting point for anyone trying to scale back and let their skin recover.\n\ni know getting into actives and skincare in general can be really scary as the skin changes so frequently, so i hope this helps someone who is feeling unsure or just getting started!",

I’m attaching a picture of how much LA blue gel I used in ONE day. Am i using too much? Not enough l? How do o know?\n3. I don’t like the back/bottom of my hair - it always gets so thick and bushy like… is this a cutting problem?? Do I need way more layers? Thin my hair?\n\nMy routine: clarifying 1-2 X a mth with Suave clarifying and then a basic tresemme or suave shampoo and conditioner on the other days. I’ve started using a cotton towel to dry my hair in the last week. I’ve sprayed some leave in conditioner . Then I have used LA blue (see picture for how much) or I use tresemme level 6 ultra hold. Then I plop up on a towel for 10ish minutes, then diffuse - a mixture of upside down and all over. Then I have resisted and haven’t sprayed hairspray for about a week… I don’t touch or do anything too my hair until I’ve then recently started trying to SOTC, though I think this just makes my hair look extra fluffy, not necessarily helps with any curls l…\n\nFrom there, as you can see it seems to last for just a few hours and then I think starts to look like a mess l… what am I doing wrong??\n\nToo much product?

      "content": "So about 5 years ago my hair was at its best curl pattern, kinda a mix between a 3a and 3b. To be honest my curl routine back then wasn’t great. I was using basic leave in (Cantù leave in conditioner) and terrible shampoo and conditioner (honestly don’t remember the brand but it was so drugstore brand). I would usually straighten my hair probably two to three times a week and dying every six months. Around 2020/2021 my curls basically disappeared. \n\nA year ago I did bleach/dye a few strands of my hair and every 6-8 months went in for a touch up. For a while I completely gave up on ever getting my curls back. But recently I’ve been so upset and heart broken about my curls. I did dye my hair to all black about 4 months ago. But since then I’ve done all I can to make my hair get stronger and try to get my curls back. I have some random wavy/curly ish strands but the underneath of my hair is basically completely straight (which was bleached so that makes sense because of the damage) I rarely use heat, I’ve been wearing protective styles and have a satin bonnet. \n\nHere’s my routine/products I’ve been using:\nShampoo/conditioner is the redken all soft mega curls \nNot your mothers curl talk mask-which I use twice a week\nLeave in/after shower care: bond repair leave in conditioner, Moroccanoil oil treatment, and Cantù wave whip mousse. Which these are in order of use as well. \n\nI’m at a loss, I don’t understand how when I took worse care of my hair my curls thrived. I do realize the dying can be super damaging but I was dying my hair like crazy 5 years ago. Now I really try to wait it out as long as I can. I will also not be bleaching my hair ever again. I did a decent chop on my hair a few months back as well. Sorry this got super long just wanted to give as much context as possible, so any products/routine/advice would be awesome!! ",

I’m 25 no history of hair loss in my family. It’s been almost 2 YEARS of my hair thinning all over my body and my pubic area is quite literally almost bald. Leg hair patchy and hair on head is growing EXTREMELY slow( one hair cut every 2 months in using minoxidil) I’ve been to an endocrinologist and dermatologist and they see nothing wrong besides Vitamin D levels being low(I’ve been on supplements for months now) I need help I have no where else to go to for advice .
