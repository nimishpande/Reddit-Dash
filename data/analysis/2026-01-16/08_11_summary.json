      "content": "Hi r/skincareaddiction!\n\nHere's my last [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1codnfd/routine_helpba_recovering_alcoholic_4_month/)from 2 years ago. I immediately followed u/Unfair_Finger5531 and changed the CeraVe PM to Vanicream. Significant improvement after that.\n\nAM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* Cos De BAHA 10% Azelaic Acid\n* Japanese or Korean Sunscreen\n\nPM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer\n* Glenmark Adapalene Gel\n\n\\---I've tried a lot of Asian sunscreens. Biore I really like as a less expensive one. Anessa dried the quickest and most matte. Centella, BoJ, Round Lab all felt the same to me. Really nice light probiotic yogurt smell. Allie was my least favorite. Most of the acne starting to stabilize at this point.---\n\nAM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* The Ordinary Azelaic Acid\n* Japanese or Korean Sunscreen\n\nPM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* SKIN1004 Soothing Cream\n* AcneFree Adapalene Gel\n\n\\---I moved to Ordinary Azelaic Acid after Cos De BAHA and didn't really notice a huge difference with either. The Vanicream was my holy grail for like a year and I randomly picked up the SKIN1004 at Costco because it was on sale. I stocked up and use that a lot now. I also picked up Torriden Dive In Soothing Cream when Costco had it on sale. I like both of these over the Vanicream. I gave up on Azelaic Acid and trying Vitamin C now.---\n\nAM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* Timeless Vitamin C\n* Japanese or Korean Sunscreen\n\nPM Routine:\n\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n* Torriden Dive In Soothing Cream\n* AcneFree Adapalene Gel\n\n\\---My current sunscreens are Thank You Farmer Green one that I also got from Costco sale and really like for travel because small bottle, but my favorite would be Nivea and Skin Aqua. Both affordable and feels great, but big bottle hard to travel with. I recently switched the Timeless to Good Molecule Discoloration Serum to help get rid of my PIH/PIE.---\n\nI'm really happy with where my skin looks and feels, but always open to recommendations/critiques/feedback/etc. My goal is to get less PIH/PIE. I still get the occasional random white head. I also want everything to look more smooth? I guess part of my alcohol addiction transferred to skincare. Lol.\n\nExtra information:\n\n* I think I'm combination. Oily T zone throughout the day and dry-ish C zone\n* Never thought I had sensitive skin\n* Avoid sun\n* Live in Southern California (dry climate)\n* Change pillowcase every 2-3 days\n* Wash towels and face towels every 2-3 day\n* Plenty of exercise and healthy diet\n* No processed foods, minimal dairy, etc.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I’ve also tried wrapping my hair in a scarf and that also falls off.\n\nPineappling also flattens my hair, I’ve tried with loose satin scrunchies too within a bonnet and it doesn’t stay. All the bonnets and hair wraps are either too loose or if they’re actually gonna stay on my head I have to tie them so tight that it hurts my head and I can’t sleep. I’m also a restless sleeper.\n\nI feel like my curls will disappear if I just breathe the wrong way, any advice to maintain my hair would be so much appreciated!!!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi everyone! Photos show my hair now air dried and not styled, brushed, and then back when my hair was shorter (also air dried). \n\nI’m kind of at a loss, I’ve always had \\*some\\* type of wave in my hair, but I’ve never figured out a proper routine. I have quite fine, soft hair, but a lot of it. My issue is, when my hair is short, the waves do come out way more. When my hair is long, it’s almost as though it’s too heavy to hold the waves properly anymore? And no matter the length, it always gets much more intense waves with the baby hairs/face framing pieces around my temple. I’ve tried many a routine with types of shower products, gels, mousses, salt sprays… but everyone seems to just weigh my hair down and it still dries in the weird half hearted wave. If I blow dry it, it’s momentarily straight, but then still shrivels up into what the photos show in like an hour. Any advice is appreciated! \n\nRoutine at the moment: wash my hair 3ish times a week with Pantene pro volume shampoo and conditioner, once every couple weeks using garnier’s hair filler system instead (it does seem a little wavier when I do this). Using revlon heat protectant spray, blow dry and style only my curtain bangs. Then, either blow or air dry (with heat protectant) the rest of my hair. Once 99% dry, throw in a loose French braid and let dry fully. Use dry shampoo and wash bangs in the sink in between. Usually loosely braid hair to sleep, however I suffer from bad migraines and can’t have my hair up all the time sleeping (it’ll trigger one) ",

      "content": "I'm doing everything like the hair care tutorials tell me to do. I use masks, conditioners, apply oil pre and post shower, I use good shampoos, I use good products, and yet my hair still looks like an undefined, frizzy mess.\n\nFor context: I (think I) have wavy hair, which is very thick (and I mean very!!!). It's always dry and puffy when I brush (I only brush with wide toothed combs, and just messy and everywhere when I dont. Its vaguely wavy but wavy in random directions, if you get what I mean. Some parts are straight, others have a slight bend, and others are downright curly. Its so confusing!!!! I don't know my hair's porosity, and im sure that matters. It goes from soaking wet to damp quickly then takes decades to go from damp to fully dry (only slightly an exaggeration). It feels coarse and gritty. I used to have some parts bleached but I cut those off and only the tips remain slightly fried. I don't use heat that much and when I do i use heat protectant. \n\nSorry if this is messy, I genuinely dont know what to do. I can't get obscure, specific products because they arent accessible from where I live, so if possible don't suggest such a thing. I don't want a miracle product, I want the idea of a miracle product (vague statement, but basically I want the description of what good products would be for me so I can find matching ones).\n\nPlease help. Im really ugly so my hair is my last chance to look good (only slightly an exaggeration).",
