I haven’t changed my hair routine, it’s been the same besides changing a few different products, for example my shampoo (for reference, I use the Camille rose shampoo, conditioner, and leave in. For gel and mousse I use the kinky curls gel and texture ID mousse and that’s the exact routine I had when my hair was voluminous).

Yeah so Tretinoin really does work if used according to your skins needs. (If you want to ask about peeling, then yes it peeled for first one year and now also it peels but significantly low peeling, and strangely the peeling kinda reduced when I jumped from 0.05% to 0.1%, so yeah it might take different durations for your skin to adapt to the peeling). If you have acne like me just know that tret can fix this, you just gotta trust the process.",

      "content": "Hi! I have been researching retinoids because I'm turning 28 this year and I've heard that now is a good time to start it for the benefit of anti-aging. However, it's really hard to find a guide and there's so many different terms (retinol, retinoid, retinal???) In my research I kept seeing Differin Adapalene Gel come up which surprised me because I actually already use it! I use the 0.1% gel for acne, but I've never applied it all over my face. I just use it as spot treatment on areas where I break out the most, and it helps! I believe it was recommended to me by a dermatologist years ago, but I had no idea you were supposed to wear sunscreen with it lmao.\n\nAnyway, I've read that you shouldn't add a retinoid if you are already using the Differin gel. Can I start just using the one I have all over my face? The one I have says \"acne treatment\" and I do feel like it helps my acne, but I am really interested in retinoid for the anti-aging effect over time.\n\nI only have minimal signs of aging right now (forehead wrinkles). My skin is prone to being dry and sensitive. All I do currently is skin cleanser, moisturizer, the acne gel where needed, and sunscreen when I remember it. Any advice or knowledge would be appreciated!!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

      "content": "Hey folks,  \nLooking for some opinions (or better yet personal experiences) on whether using minoxidil twice a day is actually worth it compared to once. Here is what I gathered so far:\n\n* HairLoss Channel on YouTube says once daily is fine.\n* Some studies suggest twice daily is “optimal” and can give \\~20% better regrowth\n* Some users argue minoxidil stays active on the scalp for \\~22 hours, so once should be enough.\n* But then I’ve seen comments saying that by the end of the day, the concentration is too low if you only apply once so twice would be better.\n\n**My routine:**\n\n* Dutasteride daily\n* Finasteride daily\n* Minoxidil once daily (with 0.25 dermastamping EOD \\~30 mins before application)\n* 1.5mm dermastamping once every 2 weeks and skip minox that day\n* PS: Where I live - Tretinoin and oral minox are unavailable\n\nBeen consistent for 5+ years. My scalp skin is pretty thick from all the dermastamping lol so I rarely bleed, just some redness. Started late in my hair loss journey (around Norwood 3) since I always had thin hair and my temples were pretty high since young age, and nobody told me about thinning crown. Treatments have helped me a lot, I managed to keep what I have, thicken things up, and get some regrowth, but not enough to cover everything properly without using styling/masking products.\n\nIf I can expect around 20% improvement, I’d go for it. If it's none or lower than 20% I would skip it since all these meds are pretty pricey.\n\nEdit: Some errors about my routine",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Hi all! The title is my current prescription - got it this morning from a dermatologist. This was my first time seeing this dermatologist or any dermat, and the process actually felt pretty rushed and I didnt have time to explain my concerns/reservations.\n\nI am a bit scared ab using either of these topical creams, partly because I wasnt struggling with acne up until 2.5 weeks before. I would get the occasional fungal acne that I use head and shoulders for and it worked. \n\nA little bit about me: I remember getting some acne when I was about 16 but idk what I did to clear it up. At this point I had started using some kind of milk soap that was drying but afair effective. Then when I was about 19 I used vitamin E on my face once and it broke me out. This prompted me to look into acne clearing \"natural\" products and I landed on this charcoal soap, that helped me quite a bit at the time. Even since then I have used that soap every day. When I was about 22, I started working out and drinking milk. This caused breakouts. But it healed by itself. I was probably still using the soap. In the recent years, I would get small acne only on my forehead and cleared up with head and shoulders.\n\nRecently, I started working out again. This time also taking whey. I started seeing small acne on my forehead and jaw, and thought it was fungal. So I applied head and shoulders and it worked for a bit until it stopped, mostly for the jaw. Now I have active breakouts on my jaw. \n\nWith this, I went to the dermatologist. My current routine invovles just the charcoal soap and BOJ sunscreen in the morning. The dermat didnt really ask for my routine, like I said. I am writing it here in case it matters. Anywho, so he has prescribed me the topical creams I wrote in the title of my post. Both every day. \n\nWhat do you all think? I understand that the dermat knows best, but i didn't get enough time with him. So I am looking for additional advice before I dive into the world of Tret! \n\nMy skin is p dry but im not sure if my barrier is compromised?\n\nCurrent pictures of my acne are attached for your reference! I turned 26 a month or so ago, if that also helps.",

I was already shedding steadily for a few years, but now I lightly run my fingers through my hair and my hand comes back with clumps of hair. \n\nMy hair looks so thin; I can clearly see my scalp every time I look in a mirror. I lose the most hair in the shower. \n\nI know minoxidil should help strengthen the hair I still have, but I am hoping anyone could suggest other remedies I can try. \n\nI've been trying the rosemary spray and the rice water; both seem to have made my remaining hair softer/smoother but have yet to see any results. I've tried Nutrafol in the past but never noticed any improvement either. \n\nAre there any medications I can take to help recover some of my hair? Preferably something that anyone has had personal success with?\n\nThank you.",

      "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI am 27 and I am starting to see some signs of aging in my skin. I'm wondering how I can better support my skin to keep it looking great as I approach 30. My main area of concern is my forehead, which has some fine lines that have become prominent over the last year. I have normal to dry skin, mostly struggling with the dryness in the wintertime as the air gets really dry where I am. I don't have a lot of issues with acne but I do have a sensitivity to fragrance, which poses an issue when finding products. I'd love to get in to Korean skincare, but I don't know where to start.\n\nMy current routine is not great, and I know that. I struggle most with face washing because I am autistic and have sensory issues so I can't really do it in the sink. I wash my face in the shower every evening. My sensory issues pose a problem when choosing products as well. I've spent a lot of money over time trying out a bunch of sunscreens and I can't wear any of them because I hate the way they feel on my face. The greasiness is what gets me. My current products absorb right into the skin, which is what I need from any product or I won't be able to use it. \n\nMy current routine:\n\nMorning: Lacura anti-wrinkle day cream\n\nEvening: Wash face with locally made goat milk soap\n\nSalicylic acid toner\n\nLacura anti-wrinkle night cream\n\nLike I said, it's not great, but I want to do better for my skin and my body, so any advice you may have is very appreciated! Thank you!",

      "content": "I am curious about how much we spend annually on upkeep and maintenance. I am older now, and I used to do the regular stuff (mani/pedi, tanning, highlights, etc), and I was curious about the costs nowadays.\n\n I am talking to the ladies who get routine (bi-weekly/monthly) cuts, color/highlights, mani/pedi, tanning (self-tanning included), lashes, extensions, facials/peels/microneedling, and waxing. I even budgeted in things like monthly massage, shopping (clothing, makeup, serums, hair products, styling tools), dental whitening, and gym memberships, as I consider those beauty, as well. The whole shebang! The only thing I am excluding is plastic surgery, but feel free to include it if you'd like!  \n\n\nI am blown away by the number I came up with, and I am wondering what is considered \"normal\" nowadays.\n\nLastly, I've noticed an online trend of women asking men to pay for these services. Not sure how true this is (as I said, I am older), but curious if there is any truth to this, and what they pay for, if you have someone else pay for these services. \n\nPlease: No hate in the comments. Everyone's budget and what they find important is different. Only love, please!\n\nIf this gets some traction, I will share my breakdown and the approximate cost I came up with in the comments later.",
