Yeah so Tretinoin really does work if used according to your skins needs. (If you want to ask about peeling, then yes it peeled for first one year and now also it peels but significantly low peeling, and strangely the peeling kinda reduced when I jumped from 0.05% to 0.1%, so yeah it might take different durations for your skin to adapt to the peeling). If you have acne like me just know that tret can fix this, you just gotta trust the process.",

Yeah so Tretinoin really does work if used according to your skins needs. (If you want to ask about peeling, then yes it peeled for first one year and now also it peels but significantly low peeling, and strangely the peeling kinda reduced when I jumped from 0.05% to 0.1%, so yeah it might take different durations for your skin to adapt to the peeling). If you have acne like me just know that tret can fix this, you just gotta trust the process.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I tried using adapalene and it broke me our further so I stopped using it and started using The Ordinary’s glycolic acid instead. It’s been amazing and my pimples have been less frequent and I currently don’t have any cystic pimples!!\n\nNow that active flare ups are done with, I want to try and take care of the hyperpigmentation and scarring. I know glycolic acid might help with that, correct me if I’m wrong. But I was wondering if I should add another product? I want something that I can use in the morning since I use glycolic acid at night. \n\nBefore anyone recommends laser, I want to hold off on that and try topical treatments. I used to break out in high school a lot but got rid of my hyperpigmentation while I was on birth control (wish I remembered the products I used…)\n\nI’ve tried tretinoin before and it broke me out as well :(\n\nMy routine is:\n\nMorning\n\n1.) Panoxyl Acne Foaming Wash 10% (I use this in the morning since I use glycolic acid at night. I might stop using it eventually since my acne has been under control)\n\n2.) Cerave moisturizer\n\n3.)

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

My budget is limited, which makes this even harder\n\nEstenove keeps popping up in ads. Their videos look solid and they have tons of positive Google and Trustpilot reviews, which is reassuring. Fuecapilar gets recommended everywhere, but it’s a bit expensive. Dr. Turan seems very legit, but I’m not sure if the difference is worth going into debt for. I’ve also seen some mixed Google reviews, even though the good results look really great. I had a video consult with Dr. Mesut and everything felt very positive. I like that it’s a boutique clinic and they only do one operation per day and I’ve found some positive real patient reviews online. On the other hand, Estenove and especially Dr. Serkan Aygin have thousands of reviews, which feels safer in a different way. With Dr. Serkan Aygin there’s so much content out there that my brain is kind of fried at this point.\n\nI really don’t want to add more clinics and confuse more. Any honest advice?",

      "content": "Hello!!! I (F31) believe I may have 2C (ft. a 3A strand) fine high porosity low density hair. Please correct me if I’m wrong! I had extremely long high density hair as a kid and the moment I hit puberty it changed completely and has basically all fallen out. I have PCOS so I’m sure this has contributed to the depletion of my hair. \n\nI’ve never known what to do with my natural hair, how to style it, care for it etc. I slam my hair with heat almost every day, I blow dry after every wash and wear it straight 99% of the time. If it’s not down and straight, it’s a slick back. Basically, I’ve had enough of damaging my hair and want to try and get it back to being healthy, grow the length, potentially get it a little thicker and embrace my natural wave/curl! \n\nMy hair in these pictures was wet and attempted to be diffused however I gave up and ended up just going over it with the blow dryer so it doesn’t look like this when it air dries. I’d say I do have a few more actual curls and a lot of frizz when it’s air dried but I have no images to show bc I’m always straightening it 🥲\n\nBasically I’m looking at where to start and for any tips/tricks to help my hair be the best it can be. I currently use the Redken acidic bonding concentrate shampoo and conditioner, as well as the leave in. Some days I use the Eleven Australia clarifying shampoo and I use the Evo heat protectant and sleep with a satin pillowcase. That’s pretty much the extent of my hair routine. \n\nHappy to accept all feedback and advice! Thanks in advance ☺️❤️",

      "content": "Hello. A few years ago I decided to finally resolve an issue I had concerning cherry angiomas on my skin. My mother mentioned a skincare clinic she had heard about and I ended up scheduling an appointment there. In hindsight I should have done more research on the topic as well as clinics because I ended up paying 600€ to have just a few of them removed via electrocautery treatment, resulting in large burns which then left scars. They aren't terrible looking scars or anything but I was left with small white hypopigmented, slightly raised bumps on my chest. Oddly enough I had two removed from my scrotum and while they appeared hypopigmented at first the scars ended up fading away.\n\nI was wondering if there are any products or treatments that can improve the appearance of these scars? To my understanding if I get any cherry angiomas removed in the future I should apply silicone scar tape to help prevent the appearance of any scars, but what can be done to fix the appearance of already developed scars? As previously mentioned they are small bumps which makes me wonder if that means they can actually be fixed so as to not have any volume and match the rest of my skin tone.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions I'd be glad to hear them! Thanks!",

I’ve also tried wrapping my hair in a scarf and that also falls off.\n\nPineappling also flattens my hair, I’ve tried with loose satin scrunchies too within a bonnet and it doesn’t stay. All the bonnets and hair wraps are either too loose or if they’re actually gonna stay on my head I have to tie them so tight that it hurts my head and I can’t sleep. I’m also a restless sleeper.\n\nI feel like my curls will disappear if I just breathe the wrong way, any advice to maintain my hair would be so much appreciated!!!",
