I picked up the BOTANIST \"Smooth\" line (the Green Apple &amp; Rose one) because I was specifically looking for an organic shampoo for women that balances protein and moisture without being heavy.  \n  \nThe difference after just two washes is actually insane. The shampoo feels really gentle but still lathers well, which is rare for sulfate-free stuff.  \n  \nHere is the full breakdown of how I managed this wash day:  \n  \nFor the wash, I used the BOTANIST Botanical Shampoo (Smooth) - I focused really heavily on massaging the scalp to make sure I got all the buildup off without stripping the lengths. I followed up with the matching BOTANIST Treatment, applying it generously from the ears down. I detangled with my fingers and used the \"squish to condish\" method to really push water into the hair shaft until it felt like seaweed.  \n  \nFor styling, I kept it simple to test the shampoo's effect. I applied Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in using the \"prayer hands\" method on soaking wet hair, then scrunched in a good amount of LA Looks Blue Gel to form a cast. I micro-plopped with an old cotton t-shirt for about 10 minutes to stop the dripping, then diffused on low heat until it was 100% dry.  \n  \nTo maintain this overnight, I sleep on a satin pillowcase with my hair up in a loose \"pineapple\". If I need a refresh on day 2 or 3, I usually just mix a little water with the leave-in in my palms and glaze it over any frizz halo.  \n  \nI'm just so relieved to see my definition back without that gross, dry feeling!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’m exhausted dealing with this.\n\nI’ve been using 5% benzoyl peroxide on my underarms in the shower, but I don’t really see much of a difference—maybe slight odor control at best. If anything, it feels like it makes me sweat more. Within about 4 hours of showering, there’s already a noticeable smell, and it just gets worse as the day goes on.\n\nI also use a salicylic acid body wash and scrub my armpits pretty thoroughly (I even washed them three times last night), but it still doesn’t help. Even with my Ouai deodorant, the odor eventually comes through.\n\nThis has become really frustrating and embarrassing, especially because I worry other people can smell it—my brother has even pointed it out before. I really need advice or recommendations because I’m at a loss.\n\nTHANK YOU 🙏",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Helloooo skincare community. I am looking for a simple product or maybe 2 products that could help with acne discolouration/ dark spots and also black heads.\n\nI struggled with acne for a long time, went on accutane which worked so good for a while. Pores literally disappeared but then my acne eventually came back. Finally got off all the hormonal stuff and my skin has balanced out (for the most part) I still get some hormonal acne along my jaw but only on the left side which is super weird. And some random smaller pimples on my cheeks but rarely.\n\nNow I have some blackheads on my cheeks which have been more common. And I also have a lot of dark spots and discolouration from acne that I’d love to heal. Currently I’m using panoxyl cleanser at night plus the panoxyl balancing moisturizer and then just using a lightweight gel moisturizer from aveeno in the morning. My skin isn’t dry and not too oily either.\n\nSo far my research has lead me to maybe azelaic acid? And maybe a toner? I’m so overwhelmed by the options! My budget is pretty low so looking for drugstore options.\n\nThank you SO much for any recommendations or advice yall have &lt;33",

I did buy some products from Curology a couple months ago but there was no noticeable improvement and I can’t afford to order more at the moment. So I’m hoping to find a few over-the-counter products that would help clear up my skin without breaking the bank. Of course helpful advice is welcome as well. \n\nMy skin is fairly dry and very uneven, I’m fairly pale and I have a ton of red marks, black heads, blemishes, acne, etc so I generally look and feel very unhygienic which obviously causes some self esteem issues.

I do have a diffuser but I’ve not had very much success with it, and I’m thinking it’s because I do not use other products in addition to my current routine.\n\nI currently live in an East Asian country where straight, thick hair is the norm—I did go to a supposed curly hair specialist in my city, and was recommended their in-house “N brand” (pictures attached) but didn’t find that these products worked very well either—even with the leave-in conditioner and using a microfiber towel, my hair still doesn’t look very well-defined and ends up pretty frizzy. \n\nI’ll have some defined curls, but when I go out/go to sleep, my hair usually just becomes a floofy mess by the time I get home/wake up in the mornings, so I’ve resorted to straightening my hair, but would love to learn how to style my natural hair. \n\nI get a little disheartened when I see products recommended here that I’m not able buy where I am—I do have access to iHerb, so if any curly girls in East Asia have similar hair and found products that work for them, I’d be super grateful to hear about those.\n\nAppreciate your time in reading through this.

But now I've watched tiktoks and done research and my new routine is as follows.\n\nAM: Water based cleanser, toner, vitamin C, ampoule, hyaluronic acid, moisturizer, then spf. \n\nPM: Oil based Cleanser, water based Cleanser, toner, retinol, and moisturizer. (Starting this week I've been switching between azelaic and niacinamide as well)\n\nI know people say to wait a couple weeks/months for the purging part to end. But am I just overcomplicating everything and just go back to the basics? Everyone online says all these products will give you the best skin and to wait it out. And I've already spent good money on all these products. Any advice? Should I stick with it or ditch it? Since my 20s I've always had good skin with occasional breakouts but nothing crazy. Now I'm worried I'm ruining my skin. I'm a 23 female btw.",

Going forward now I had long 2a hair but eat very healthy and excercise, but i don't do anything special with my hair because the products seem too complex for me to work out what to do, I get a haircut a few weeks back and now my hair is much more curlier than it ever has been, like almost 3a hair while short, its considerably curlier to the point people think I did something special with my hair.\n\nSo that begs the question, can eating a healthy diet actually make your hair curlier, or is this some kind of cognitive bias I have and Im forgetting how curly it used to be?",

Right now, I’m using cosrx salicylic acid face wash, Anua niacinamide 10x Txa 4 serum, dr Althea moisturizer and a moisturizer. I tried Indian skincare but did not see any results so tried Korean skincare as well but nothing helps. I tried home remedies using turmeric and all but still no use. And the acne is causing severe pain 😭😭😭😭\n\nNeed genuine advice :( Thanks a ton in advance ",

Can another hairdresser do something to fix it? My only idea is that maybe somebody could bleach over the dark stripes and just turn it into a big colorblock highlight, but I have no idea if that would even be possible. ",

      "content": "Hi all! I've got this problem where my hair looks \"curly\" for about 30 minutes every other time it gets wet, then goes back to flat \"wavy-at-best\" in a few hours. Is there anything I can do to retain the definition and volume without spending half my life on maintenance, or should i just come to terms with having straight hair?\n\nI've tried different shampoos, conditioners, blow drying/not blow drying methods, and ended up with a cabinet full of half-used products that I spent way too much on &amp; gave up because the results seemed like placebo compared to the amount of effort that went into it. Not to mention the scalp weigh-down... It seems like everyone has their own curly hair routine they swear by that i could spent hundreds of dollars on commiting to only to find out that it doesn't work for me.\n\nNow I'm back at square one, which means washing my hair every 2-3 days with whatever shitty 2-in-1 Schauma Men Sports shampoo i have on hand, using Syoss Intense Oleo conditioner every other wash to prevent complete matting, and leaving it alone to air dry. This was also the treatment after which i took the first picture. Later I decided to give it one more try and invest in OnlyBio curl activator cream &amp; Taft curl styling balm, rubbed about a pea sized amount of each into wet hair after washing, and it instantly turned whatever \"curls\" there were into silky smooth, flat loose strands that refused to form any definition. This🤏 close to just giving up on it lol\n\nSo, question to the experienced curlyheads that started out with flat, straight-ish hair. How did you build your routine? Is it even worth it?",
