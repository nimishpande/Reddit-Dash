      "title": "Finally got my high porosity curls to clump properly!",
      "content": "I honestly have to share this because I was about two days away from just chopping all my hair off. For the last few months, my curl pattern has been completely undefined, just mushy, frizzy, and refusing to clump, no matter how much gel I used.  \n  \nI realized my old products were probably stripping my hair too much, so I decided to look into Japanese haircare since I heard they use milder surfactants. I picked up the BOTANIST \"Smooth\" line (the Green Apple &amp; Rose one) because I was specifically looking for an organic shampoo for women that balances protein and moisture without being heavy.  \n  \nThe difference after just two washes is actually insane. The shampoo feels really gentle but still lathers well, which is rare for sulfate-free stuff.  \n  \nHere is the full breakdown of how I managed this wash day:  \n  \nFor the wash, I used the BOTANIST Botanical Shampoo (Smooth) - I focused really heavily on massaging the scalp to make sure I got all the buildup off without stripping the lengths. I followed up with the matching BOTANIST Treatment, applying it generously from the ears down. I detangled with my fingers and used the \"squish to condish\" method to really push water into the hair shaft until it felt like seaweed.  \n  \nFor styling, I kept it simple to test the shampoo's effect. I applied Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in using the \"prayer hands\" method on soaking wet hair, then scrunched in a good amount of LA Looks Blue Gel to form a cast. I micro-plopped with an old cotton t-shirt for about 10 minutes to stop the dripping, then diffused on low heat until it was 100% dry.  \n  \nTo maintain this overnight, I sleep on a satin pillowcase with my hair up in a loose \"pineapple\". If I need a refresh on day 2 or 3, I usually just mix a little water with the leave-in in my palms and glaze it over any frizz halo.  \n  \nI'm just so relieved to see my definition back without that gross, dry feeling!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I’m exhausted dealing with this.\n\nI’ve been using 5% benzoyl peroxide on my underarms in the shower, but I don’t really see much of a difference—maybe slight odor control at best. If anything, it feels like it makes me sweat more. Within about 4 hours of showering, there’s already a noticeable smell, and it just gets worse as the day goes on.\n\nI also use a salicylic acid body wash and scrub my armpits pretty thoroughly (I even washed them three times last night), but it still doesn’t help. Even with my Ouai deodorant, the odor eventually comes through.\n\nThis has become really frustrating and embarrassing, especially because I worry other people can smell it—my brother has even pointed it out before. I really need advice or recommendations because I’m at a loss.\n\nTHANK YOU 🙏",

I do have a diffuser but I’ve not had very much success with it, and I’m thinking it’s because I do not use other products in addition to my current routine.\n\nI currently live in an East Asian country where straight, thick hair is the norm—I did go to a supposed curly hair specialist in my city, and was recommended their in-house “N brand” (pictures attached) but didn’t find that these products worked very well either—even with the leave-in conditioner and using a microfiber towel, my hair still doesn’t look very well-defined and ends up pretty frizzy. \n\nI’ll have some defined curls, but when I go out/go to sleep, my hair usually just becomes a floofy mess by the time I get home/wake up in the mornings, so I’ve resorted to straightening my hair, but would love to learn how to style my natural hair. \n\nI get a little disheartened when I see products recommended here that I’m not able buy where I am—I do have access to iHerb, so if any curly girls in East Asia have similar hair and found products that work for them, I’d be super grateful to hear about those.\n\nAppreciate your time in reading through this.

      "content": "Hi all! I've got this problem where my hair looks \"curly\" for about 30 minutes every other time it gets wet, then goes back to flat \"wavy-at-best\" in a few hours. Is there anything I can do to retain the definition and volume without spending half my life on maintenance, or should i just come to terms with having straight hair?\n\nI've tried different shampoos, conditioners, blow drying/not blow drying methods, and ended up with a cabinet full of half-used products that I spent way too much on &amp; gave up because the results seemed like placebo compared to the amount of effort that went into it. Not to mention the scalp weigh-down... It seems like everyone has their own curly hair routine they swear by that i could spent hundreds of dollars on commiting to only to find out that it doesn't work for me.\n\nNow I'm back at square one, which means washing my hair every 2-3 days with whatever shitty 2-in-1 Schauma Men Sports shampoo i have on hand, using Syoss Intense Oleo conditioner every other wash to prevent complete matting, and leaving it alone to air dry. This was also the treatment after which i took the first picture. Later I decided to give it one more try and invest in OnlyBio curl activator cream &amp; Taft curl styling balm, rubbed about a pea sized amount of each into wet hair after washing, and it instantly turned whatever \"curls\" there were into silky smooth, flat loose strands that refused to form any definition. This🤏 close to just giving up on it lol\n\nSo, question to the experienced curlyheads that started out with flat, straight-ish hair. How did you build your routine? Is it even worth it?",

      "content": "I’m 23F, and up until May 2025, I never had a single skin concern. I would get the occasional pimple, but nothing that would last.\n\nAround May, I noticed that I was starting to break out with deep pimples on my cheeks that usually didn’t have a whitehead. These breakouts had some slight redness to them, but were mostly only noticeable to the touch. I started on spironolactone in September, but since then, the number of active pimples I have has probably decreased, but the redness on my cheeks has markedly increased. A lot of it looks like hyperpigmentation that definitely wasn’t there before. I also have a bunch of small skin-colored bumps on my cheeks and near my mouth which I think may be clogged pores that again, I didn’t have before around May 2025.\n\nMy skincare routine up until late December has been CeraVe oil based cleanser, followed by the CeraVe water based cleanser, and finished with Vanicream facial moisturizer nightly.\n\nIn December, I decided to try out some products I thought might help, so now I’m still double cleansing every night, followed but the AHA BHA PHA toner by Some By Mi, then will switch off between benzoyl peroxide and CeraVe salicylic acid, and then followed by the same Vanicream moisturizer. A few nights a week I’ll also use the Ordinary niacinamide serum. In the mornings, I’ll also wash with just the water based cleanser, sometimes will use either benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, and then finish with moisturizer and sunscreen. It’s been about a month of doing this and I’m seeing little to no change.\n\nAt this point, do I need to keep trying to treat the acne or is my skin barrier the problem? I hesitate to think it’s my skin barrier since I wasn’t using any active ingredients until December when I figured the spironolactone + simple routine wasn’t enough. TIA!",
