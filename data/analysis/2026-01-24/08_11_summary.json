I also feel like my curls are very forced, and i have to use a lot of water to make them pop, I’ve also switched to silk pillow recently which helps a bit i guess",

My hair feels like it almost randomizes, some days like the 1st photo, some like tbe 2nd, sometimes straighter, sometimes curlier, but usually between the 1st and 2nd photo. 3rd 4th pics are my hair rn after a brush with today being hair wash day\n\nI know I have curls, I think maybe 2b? Not totally sure though. I've heard i may need a clarifying shampoo, but im very uneducated about properly taking care of my curls, though I have tried with experimenting. Ive thought about olaplex, but ive seen a ton of reviews its absolutely ruined people's hair texture \n\nmy routine:\n\n\\- hair wash every other day \n\n\\- shampoo: Pantene Pro V daily moisture renewal \n\n\\- conditioner: Pantene Pro V daily moisture renewal \n\n\\- second conditioner: Hask organic oil repairing conditioner\n\n\\- brush out and let air dry, scrunch method\n\n\\- very recently ive been using argan magic intensive hair oil about once a week but havent noticed a substantial difference \n\n\\- my hair becomes incredibly frizzy and loses curl texture after brushing when its dry, but curls up immediately after a shower\n\nI feel kind of at a loss on what my hair needs. I see all this stuff about proteins and other elements, and I need to do more research, but im not sure where to look or even what my hair type actually is. \n\ncurious if anyone else would reccomend a clarifying shampoo, as im sure I have decent build up potentially. any advice would be great! tysm!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "TLDR: I can no longer ignore the years of evidence I have that my skin hates glycerin, and I refused to believe it at first even though I'd applied it to my bare skin heavily diluted in water and it still caused irritation. \n\nI've tried cutting out a variety of ingredients over the years, desperately trying to figure out what was causing my skin woes (redness, flare ups, cystic acne, enlarged pores, dehydration), to no avail. I'd give up on a routine for whatever reason (had to move or got sick or something), my skin barrier would heal, I'd start a routine again, and my skin would tolerate everything for a while before the exact same problems would start up again. This would always happen with a fairly mild routine, no harsh acids or retinoids.\n\nRecently I decided to try the new Prequel glycolic cleanser. I have no issue with glycolic acid and I didn't like the OG gleanser but I chalked that up to the oat flour (one time I tried making a face mask with just water and colloidal oatmeal and I had to wash it off because my face was ON FIRE). A few days of the prequel cleanser and I started noticing a bumpy texture along my jawline, and then I got the most angry, bumpy, red rash on my chest. Obviously I stopped using it and the rash healed, but it got me thinking again about what I'm doing with my skincare that isn't working. \n\nI sat down and made a list of every product I remember trying over the last 5 years or so that I stopped using because of a burning/stinging sensation when I put them on, and then left my face feeling tight and dry. That was already about 30 products on its own, there was no way I was going to remember every product I'd tried that caused my face to redden immediately, so I decided to just focus on the ones that caused immediate discomfort. The products ranged from having very few ingredients to quite a lot, and being both with and without HA, niacinamide, silicones, glycols/diols, and oils. With the help of another user (thank you u/Common_Piccolo_6946!!) I got a spreadsheet made with the ingredient, the number of times it was found, and the products it was found in. \n\nObviously, water was #1, no shock there. Glycerin was #2, no surprise there either. Of course glycerin is #2, she's in everything! You want her in your products! Ok, a lot of these have fatty alcohols and/or fatty acids, some people have issues with those, maybe I do too! This didn't cover every product on the list, but it seemed a viable enough theory. The one that sent me back to the drawing board though was Geek &amp; Gorgeous Hydration Station, WOW did that one burn. I looked at the ingredients again and decided to revisit my list and see how many products had a high concentration of glycerin and/or multiple derivatives i.e. as capric/caprylic triglyceride, the preservative form, emulsifier(s), and the pure form, all in the same product. I think the only product that wasn't true for was TO Amino Acids + B5.\n\nThis made me think of something I'd tried about a year ago, I was desperate to do something about the persisent dehydration I was experiencing, and had seen people on here talking about great results from diluting a small amount of pure glycerin in distilled water. I tried using the solution I'd made a few times and literally watched the redness spread across my face, and I guess I decided to put this experience out of my mind because it was inconvenient information? I never said I was smart, y'all. If I'm right, and I had taken seriously what was essentially a failed patch test, I could have saved myself from so much frustration, not to mention time and money spent buying and returning products. I have broken capillaries in my cheeks and chin from flare ups, and PIH from deep painful cystic acne, both of which would only happen after I started up a routine again. \n\nSo in summary, I feel so relieved that I may have figured out the problem, but a small part of me desperately hopes I'm still wrong because how on earth am I going to find both a moisturizer and sunscreen that don't contain *any* forms of glycerin?!? No luck on either so far, but I intend to keep looking, because I've mostly been avoiding products with glycerin for the past few days, and tbh my skin is already feeling way less reactive. Very sorry for the extremely long post, thank you to anyone who read the whole thing!",

She also told me to moisturise properly.\n\nNow I had never applied any kind of acne cream before although I do have a skincare routine of toner, serums and all.\n\nAfter like 2-3 days of applying the gel and cleaning with face wash. My face started to burn particularly my eye lids and under eye and the skin started to get flaky.I had to cut my other skin care products also and just apply sunscreen and moisturiser.\n\nAfter that I wasn’t regular in applying for a week so my skin got better.\n\nBy this week I started to apply it again and again it’s happening and now around my mouth too, when I apply sunscreen, moisturisers. Even after I apply a good amount of moisturiser it still stays dry.\n\nSo I just want to ask a few questions\n\ndoes this happen usually?\n\nIs the acne gel and CeraVe face wash clashing?\n\nIf not then please suggest a weekly routine to follow to apply this gel and face wash :)\n\nAnd Could you suggest a good moisturiser for when applying acne creams..",
