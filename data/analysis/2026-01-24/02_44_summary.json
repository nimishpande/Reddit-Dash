I also feel like my curls are very forced, and i have to use a lot of water to make them pop, I’ve also switched to silk pillow recently which helps a bit i guess",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Everything was fine for like 2 months then all hell broke loose, my hair started falling out and my skin went crazy. Now I’m constantly fighting never ending acne and texture. It has been the most embarrassing thing and killing my confidence. \n\nI’ve tried so many different things and nothing helps and my skin seems to hate everything (I’ve never had sensitive skin but now any time I put anything on it it freaks out.) I literally use to only use makeup wipes for years and never had any problems (bad I know.)\n\nI’ve been trying a super simple routine because I thought maybe I messed up my skin barrier from trying different things. \n\nMy Skin is combination with more oily on my t-zone and dry on cheeks. My skin always looks dehydrated no matter what I use to try to help it. I’ve been getting horrible texture, closed comedones, and regular pimples all over my forehead and hairline. My checks get regular pimples and deep painful hormonal acne. My chin gets tons of closed comedones and deep painful hormonal acne.\n\nMy morning: \n\nUsually just wash with water and apply Avene Tolerance Control Skin Recovery Cream before my makeup.\n\nNight: \n\n• I will wash with Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Lotion Cleanser\n\n• Apply Avene Tolerance Control Skin Recovery Cream \n\n(The Avene products at least don’t make things as bad as other things but nothing is getting better and I never feel like my skin feels hydrated)\n\nAs Needed: \n\n• Murad Deep Relief Acne Treatment for when I get deep painful hormonal acne - (the only thing that seems to get them to calm down some)\n\n• Pimple Patches for when I get pimples that have stuff in them \n\nI’ve tried:\n\n• Cetaphil and Cerave cleansers and got super deep painful acne \n\n• Eradikate sulfur wash - didn’t really do anything\n\n• Elf Holy Hydration and Cetaphil moisturizing cream gave me a lot of closed comedones \n\n• Benzoyl Peroxide and Clindamycin didn’t really do anything \n\n• Panoxyl caused texture on my forehead\n\nMy doctor gave me tretinoin gel 0.025% to start using and I’ve used it one night so far this week and did the sandwich method.\n\nI’m just so lost, upset, never dealt with acne before and feel so insecure. Please give me all the advice, recommendations, tips, observations. Thank you so much you beautiful people. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe have a really bad family history of hair loss on my mom’s side, including women. I was able to catch mine early and got decent results with finasteride, but my mom’s hair is thinning badly, similar to my grandmother’s. I understand that hair loss in women can be more complicated.\n\nLately, this has been affecting her emotionally a lot. She’s become afraid to even take a shower because of how much hair she sees falling out, and sometimes she cries because of it. Seeing her go through this honestly breaks my heart.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for what I could help her use? Would minoxidil or spironolactone be appropriate? Can they be used together? Or is there anything else she could try?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

      "content": "Its been like 2-3 years since I stopped straightening my hair with a comb, and let them grow longer and make natural curls. These are my natural curls that I am now tired of taming and maintaining. Its a struggle to even ride a two wheeler or a rickshaw without absolutely ruining my hair within a minute of some wind. I tried the hair wax and gel, and the 5 step processes that ChatGPT told me to do, but nothing works. Would love some suggestions or help here.\n\nMy hair routine, for context, is weekly to oil it (with a local business' herbal oil) moderately and keep it for half a day, shampoo it with a sulphate free ocean kelp shampoo (Biotique), and then a hyaluronic acid conditioner (Loreal) for 5-10 mins. I let them air dry on hair wash days. On normal days I either soak them in the shower or spray water on them to detangle my curls before wiping them almost dry with a towel. They dont get completely dry ever even with a towel. I use the hair wax (Bare Anatomy) here and there occasionally but honestly there's no difference. \n\nAll I want is for them to look fluffy with volume while looking decent and tame enough at work or outdoors. Thanks for reading this much lol... ",

I am concerned that the copper peptide in it will accelerate facial hair growth. Is there any truth to this with it being a facial serum formulated for skin ? I am also looking at the Nivea Epigenetics serum that Cheryl Tweedy advertises as an alternative but am unsure if this would be as effective as a copper peptide serum. Any advice would be greatly appreciated… much love ❤️ ",
