I also feel like my curls are very forced, and i have to use a lot of water to make them pop, I’ve also switched to silk pillow recently which helps a bit i guess",

I see all this stuff about proteins and other elements, and I need to do more research, but im not sure where to look or even what my hair type actually is. \n\ncurious if anyone else would reccomend a clarifying shampoo, as im sure I have decent build up potentially. any advice would be great! tysm!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m looking for advice because I honestly have no idea where to start with my hair.\n\nI recently did a big chop (first image). My hair used to be mid-back length, but it was very damaged, so I cut it shorter to try and start fresh. I have not created a routine at all yet so I am unable to provide one I’ve been mix matching between creams, mousses, gels, oils and leave-ins trying to find something that works. The first picture is no product but it is diffused to the best of my ability. I hover dry for 15 minutes and pixie diffuse for another 5 minutes until completely dry. Other than that I use head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner as this is the only thing that has seemed to work for me.\n\nI’ve had curly and frizzy hair since I was a kid, but it was never really taken care of properly. Both my parents have straight hair, so no one really knew how to manage curls. It was almost always brushed out and pulled into a low ponytail or slicked-back ponytail, which definitely didn’t help.\n\nOn top of that, I started using heat on my hair every day from around age 13, and I’ve only just recently stopped at 21, so I’m sure that contributed a lot to the damage and loss of curl pattern.\n\nWhen I was younger, I did actually have spiral curls, and even recently my hair can still form curls, but they feel inconsistent and hard to maintain.\n\nI also went to a hairdresser for my 21st birthday hoping to get my curls styled and shaped properly, but it was honestly a terrible experience. Their website advertised curl-focused styling, but they barely put effort into defining or styling my curls, and the result didn’t reflect what I was hoping for at all (second image).\n\nRight now my biggest struggles are frizz, flat roots with no volume at the scalp, curls forming more on the ends but looking limp or weighed down at the top, and not knowing whether I should focus on moisture, protein, lighter products, or something else.\n\nEverything I’ve tried so far seems to either weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy and undefined.\n\nIf anyone has advice on how to help curls become healthier, how to get volume at the roots, what kind of routine or products might suit fine to medium curly hair, or even just where to start when you’ve never really learned curl care, I’d seriously appreciate it. Also I’m from Australia, so preferably Aussie products!\n\nAny advice is welcome because I feel pretty lost and overwhelmed. Thanks so much!",

I am over the age of 18 now, so it’s been a couple years. It’s definitely my problem area. Here’s what my history with acne treatments looks like:\n\n\\- Accutane when I was 14 for about 9 months (helped with postules I had on my forehead, but never these bumps)\n\n\\- differin, again no improvement \n\n\\- Aklief, no improvement \n\n\\- facials with a dermatologist, helped temporarily but they come back soon after\n\nAnd at the moment I am on 0.05 tret. I have been on it for about 2 and a half months so I can’t speak to its efficacy.\n\nThis is my current skincare routine (been doing this routine for 2 years, only new addition is the Tret):\n\nam.\n\n\\- LRP SA face wash\n\n\\- LRP cicaplast moisturizer \n\n\\- bioderma sunscreen \n\nPm\n\n\\- panoxyl face wash\n\n\\- LRP cicaplast moisturizer \n\n\\- tret\n\nI’m just not confident that anything will work really😭 I feel like I’ve used all the things you’re supposed to use (like Accutane, salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, retinol) but to no avail.\n\n I tried not washing my face in the morning with the SA face wash for a week at one point to see if I was maybe over exfoliating, and instead used a gentle cerave cleanser, but it got worse so I just went back to the LRP sa cleanser.\n\nA friend of mine mentioned that it might be fungal, and recommended a sulfur face ointment(by De La Cruz) that she had found helpful.\n\nJust not sure what to do really - if anyone has any advice I would be super grateful.",

My only concern is that I previously dyed my hair a very dark brown multiple times. However my roots have grown out since I last dyed it, so I know that the top of my head will likely be a more vibrant red than the rest of my hair. Is there any way to prevent this from happening? I do not have any more dark hair dye to correct it beforehand. My original thought was to start by applying the red dye from the bottom up, leaving less time for the dye to stay on the grown out portions up top. Would this help at all? Any advice is welcome! ",
