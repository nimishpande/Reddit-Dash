But since switching to oral, it feels like I’ve completely stalled.\n\nHow is it possible to be a non-responder to oral when topical had some effect? I thought oral usually works better due to systemic absorption. Could genetics, enzyme differences, or dosage explain this?\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else has experienced something similar — and whether upping the dose helped or not.\n",

The day starts good but I’m clearly doing something wrong. \n\nWe wash it 3 times a week, more or less is better? We use fairy tails curly Q shampoo conditioner, is that good? Does she need a silk pillowcase? Some kind of bonnet (if she’d even wear it)? Do I need an unbrush? Why is it so frizzy halfway through the day and how do I fix it?",

I’ve been using tat hair mask for a month now and still, little to no improvement. At this point, i’m convinced that my hair will never recover from whatever that lady did to my hair and i’m so so frustrated. both at myself for caving and allowing her to blow dry and straighten my hair, and at her for ruining my hair. Idk if any of you have had this happen to yall but i’ll take any advice at this point because im seriously desperate. My hair is straight in same areas and wavy in others.  it’s not dry, it’s quite soft so i don’t think it needs to be cut off. Also, i’m still using the exact same mousee, curl cream, shampoo, and conditioner that I used before i went to that salon. so yeah, do yall think there’s no going back? Oh and I would attach a picture of a before and after of my hair but i’m a hijabi so i can’t, thanks! ",

      "content": "For years I battled melasma and dull, uneven skin. I used tretinoin, hydroquinone, AHA/BHA peels, vitamin C, and at least 10 bottles of Eucerin, and I wore sunscreen every single day. Still, my melasma didn’t move. My skin always looked tired, patchy, and lifeless.\n\nFinally, I went to a dermatologist, and that changed everything. He examined my skin and told me something I never realized constant tret and hydroquinone was actually irritating my skin, keeping it inflamed and stopping it from healing. He took me off it completely and started me on a new plan with oral tranexamic acid and a 4-peel treatment cycle — two Nomelan Fenol Light  (the deeper ones) and two Colombia peels (milder and brightening), one each month to give my skin time to recover and slowly lift pigmentation. For maintenance, he prescribed Cosglo and Depimax Serum\n\nI also told him how I had tried every “good” moisturizer CeraVe, Cetaphil, La Roche Posay, Laneige  and nothing ever made my skin feel hydrated. He smiled and told me to use Venusia Max, which costs around ₹600, and honestly it’s been a miracle. My skin finally feels calm, plump, and genuinely moisturized, something even the expensive ones never managed.\n\nI’ve just finished my first Nomelan Fenol Light peel a week back , and my face looks so fresh and smooth. The melasma patches have softened, my texture feels refined, and that constant tired look is gone.\n\nAfter years of experimenting and wasting money, I’ve realized how powerful a good dermatologist can be.

      "content": "*long post*\n\nHi everyone. I'm a 28F and a total noob at skincare. I'm trying to look for recommendations on how I can improve my skin. I believe my skin type is \"Normal to Dry\" and overall I think my goals if we're looking to that are moisturizing, as I live in a very dry and often windy climate, as well as repair/scar healing because my job often results in my face being scratched, and I'm starting to get some wrinkles. I would also love if anything can be done for my dark under eyes however they seem to be hereditary which to my knowledge means not much can be done for that.\n\nThe acne I'm not *as* worried about as it appears to be hormonal based, which to my knowledge, skincare can't really help. But I am making efforts with my doctor to manage my PCOS and weight. \n\nI don't know if I've got the wrong goals, wrong products, or what but I'm trying to make efforts for improving my health overall which I am sure will benefit my skin but I'm also trying to form a routine that'll help me be my best. Any and all recommendations are welcome but do please know I'm trying to stick to more budget friendly options as much as possible. \n\nMy routine is going as of the following-\n\nMorning Routine: \n1.Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (Normal to Dry Skin)\n\n2.CeraVe skin renewing Vitamin C serum\n\n3.Neurtrogena Hydro Boost Water Cream\n\n4. Covergirl Blurring Skintint + 30SPF. \n\n\nMidday Routine, as part of my job involves being outside for approximately 30-40 minutes middle of the day:\n\n1. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (Normal to Dry Skin) \n\n2. Vaseline/petroleum jelly applied to the lips. \n\n\nAnd lastly Nighttime Routine:\n\n1. CeraVe Hydrating Foam Oil Cleanser (Dry to Very Dry skin)\n\n2. Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Moisturizer (Night) \n\n\nSorry for the long post but just ugh yeah clearly my skin is not great looking and I would just really love to know where and how to improve it. Again I know getting PCOS and hormones under control will help a lot but I've still got a lot to do. Appreciate any and all advice on improvement. Thanks for taking the time to read and for your advice. 💙",

I did some research and saw several articles recommending Shea Moisture Men Deep Conditioner so I picked up a bottle to give it a shot. It wasn't until I got home when I read on the back it was \"built to serve men of color\". I've had white friends use black friends' hair products with disastrous results (granted the white friends all had straight hair in those instances) and I can't see anywhere on their website, forums or reviews  where it's recommended for Caucasian hair.  Does anyone know if this is safe for me to use in my hair or will I just damage my hair or make a mess? \n\nIf I have to post a routine, I generally use Head and Shoulders Thick then condition with said stolen coconut curls and air dry.",

Then i learnt it’s cuz I need to have a routine. Turns out my hair is more wavy than I thought. I use the creams and scrunch and use a diffuser. Some days it even looks curly. \n\nI read that bonnets are really good for frizz control. And I bought one but it falls off. Maybe I need a better one? The band is pretty stretchy and polyester so it’s quite slippy. \n\nIs that supposed to be right? Also whats the easiest way to put it on? I usually braid or French braid my hair for night. But I struggled so much just now trying to put it on. \n\nAny tips on easy put on and making it stay at night? Anyways thank you ♥️ Oh and if anyone has wavy hair let me know what is your routine. I’m just getting started and I know I have much to learn ",

It’s been around 1.5 weeks since they appeared and they’re not settling down.\n\nI recently started using the Re’equil Oil-Free Moisturiser (Hyaluronic Acid + Betaine) about 2 weeks ago, and I’m wondering if it could be the cause. My skin type is oily.\n\nAnother factor is that my sleep cycle has been disturbed lately. I’ve been sleeping irregularly for the past few days, so I’m not sure if that’s contributing too.\n\nDo these look like closed comedones or fungal acne? And if it’s from the moisturizer, should I stop it completely or try using it differently? Any suggestions on how to calm this down or improve skin texture would really help 🙏\n\nThanks in advance.\n",
