For reference my hair is board straight, like it air dries straighter than some people after a straightener. So I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing with my daughter’s curly hair. \n\nI’ve got good product I think, color wow spray. And I know to spray it wet before brushing (now…) but halfway through the day it’s always frizzy and the curls fall out and lately she’s getting BAD knots and some matting. The day starts good but I’m clearly doing something wrong. \n\nWe wash it 3 times a week, more or less is better? We use fairy tails curly Q shampoo conditioner, is that good? Does she need a silk pillowcase? Some kind of bonnet (if she’d even wear it)? Do I need an unbrush? Why is it so frizzy halfway through the day and how do I fix it?",

All of this has lead to a lot of hair fall. I used to have thick, long hair and now I’m left with barely a third of it. \n\nI tried rosemary oil, hoping it would help with regrowth, but it only caused more shedding so I stopped using it.

So i wear it either in a (low) ponytail or to the side as you see in these pictures.\nIve had my hair styled for a wedding once and then they curled it which did really like.

I used tretinoin, hydroquinone, AHA/BHA peels, vitamin C, and at least 10 bottles of Eucerin, and I wore sunscreen every single day. Still, my melasma didn’t move. My skin always looked tired, patchy, and lifeless.\n\nFinally, I went to a dermatologist, and that changed everything. He examined my skin and told me something I never realized constant tret and hydroquinone was actually irritating my skin, keeping it inflamed and stopping it from healing. He took me off it completely and started me on a new plan with oral tranexamic acid and a 4-peel treatment cycle — two Nomelan Fenol Light  (the deeper ones) and two Colombia peels (milder and brightening), one each month to give my skin time to recover and slowly lift pigmentation. For maintenance, he prescribed Cosglo and Depimax Serum\n\nI also told him how I had tried every “good” moisturizer CeraVe, Cetaphil, La Roche Posay, Laneige  and nothing ever made my skin feel hydrated. He smiled and told me to use Venusia Max, which costs around ₹600, and honestly it’s been a miracle. My skin finally feels calm, plump, and genuinely moisturized, something even the expensive ones never managed.\n\nI’ve just finished my first Nomelan Fenol Light peel a week back , and my face looks so fresh and smooth. The melasma patches have softened, my texture feels refined, and that constant tired look is gone.\n\nAfter years of experimenting and wasting money, I’ve realized how powerful a good dermatologist can be.

      "content": "Hello everyone!\n3 nights ago I've introduced the Seoul 1988 Retinal serum to my routine. I did a patch test before because I have fairly sensitive skin (but truth to be told, I only heard about the sandwich method after I've began showing weird symptoms) and my skin was fine. After I've used it, on the next day I've had a little bit of redness on my cheeks so I dropped it and went back to just double cleansing, moisturizer and sunscreen. The second day (yesterday) the redness and itchiness became even worse, but it subsided by the time I was about to go to sleep, so I thought my skin might be calming down. Then this is how I woke up this morning (see pictures).\nI'm hoping it's visible enough, but my skin is very red and irritated, it is warm to the touch, itching like CRAZY, and I have very small whiteheads on my nose and forehead. Is this a 'retinol purge' or something else entirely? Any tips on how to soothe my skin would be very much appreciated as I am honestly freaking out.🫠\n\nMy current routine: Anua heartleaf cleansing oil, Anua HA8 + panthenol gentle foaming cleanser, Purrito mighty bamboo panthenol cream, Skin1004 hyalu-cica sunscreen.",

We never really noticed any issues with our skin until the past couple of months I've developed crazy itchiness over my body- completely random. An itchy scalp that just always feel inflamed and itchy. When I scratch my skin it becomes red(way more than normal) and then about 30mins later goes away. Both me and my wife's skin just seems like we've aged way more than what we are supposed to look like at 36 years old  \n  \nSomeone pointed out to me that it might be my our hard water causing this and I tried oats bath and it made a massive difference in the skin feeling so much better. But I am still getting these symptoms on a daily basis even after 2 weeks of using this approach. It's definitely better, but still there on a daily basis. Unsure how long this takes to completely get better?  \n  \nHas anyone else had such a crazy response after such a long time of exposure or is this something else?

      "title": "[Acne] Struggling with skincare - advice needed 🙏🏼",
      "content": "Hi! I am really needing help with my skincare routine, and any help would be greatly appreciated!!! This is super long, sorry!! \n\nTo start, I have somewhat (?) sensitive skin (not sure if I can still say this though, as a child my eczema was pretty bad but now I don’t think I have it at all. When I was in my teens (21 now) some scented products would make my face super bumpy and sometimes itchy, but as an adult I am able to use makeup/skincare products and not struggle with bumpiness, itchiness, or sensitivity.) I have combination skin that is more on the oily side for most of the year, but in the winter I can get kind of dry. \n\nMy main skincare concerns right now are what I believe to be closed and open comedones all over my face (concentrated near brows, on my nose, and on my chin, on cheeks frequently as well). I do get nodules/pimples(?) (Google university is my source) occasionally, but they usually show up around my cycle and when I eat a lot of sugar. \n\nI’ve been to the dermatologist multiple times, first I was prescribed benzoyl for my entire face and saw no difference. Early last year I was prescribed tretinoin (0.05) and used it (instructed to use it twice a week at first then increase) for about 2 months, but my face became so dry and flakey that it was painful, and even putting moisturizer on would make my skin feel sensitive. I started using it once a week, focusing on moisturizing for the rest of the week. Went back and shared that w/ the dr, got a 0.025 prescription and the dr said I needed to be using it at least twice a week to see results. Even with the lower prescription, the same dryness problem persisted when using it twice a week so I kind of just gave up on the tretinoin alone.\n\nWith all that being said, I decided to try using some new skincare products to address my concerns.\n\nMost recently, this is the skincare routine I’d been trying (for a little over 2 weeks):\n\nAnua Heartleaf Oil Cleanser (pm)\nCetaphil Fragrance Free Daily Facial Cleanser (am+pm)\nAnua Rice 70 Milk Toner (am+pm)\nMedicube Zero Pore Pads (1x week) (pm)\nTretinoin (1x week) (pm)\nCetaphil Hydrating Ceramide Serum w/ Cica + Allantoin (am+pm)\nAveeno Oat Gel Moisturizer (am+pm)\n\nI thought that spacing out the Medicube pads with the Tretinoin might help to clear up my skin without drying it out so much since the Pads have hydrating properties and I was adding in the Cetaphil serum. So far, I haven’t noticed any dryness, but I have noticed a bunch of little pimples (or maybe whiteheads with pus? Idk) all over my face recently. I thought at first when they were more sparse that it could be my skin purging a little, so I kept using all of the same products, but when I started looking into purging v. breaking out I read that purging usually takes place in typical problem areas (not the case for me). I stopped using the Anua products, which were the two main products I figured my skin would react poorly with. That was a couple days ago, so I am still waiting for my skin to clear up from the little pimples, but I have not noticed any new ones pop up, so I think I might have been correct in assuming it was one of those products. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or advice for how I could better address my skincare concerns, I would really appreciate the help!

      "content": "so i have (or did have i guess) 3a/3b long hair and exactly 3 months ago, i went to a salon to get a long layered hair cut so my hair wont weigh down my curls as much and the hair dresser ended up convincing me to get my hair straightened and blow dried as well (even tho i kept telling her i didn’t want to use any heat on my hair) she put a bit of oil on my hair before this but i dont think it was heat protectant (this was overseas so i cant go back to her and ask what oil she used) anyways, i didnt wash my hair until a few days later and i thought my hair would be normal after washing so i continued with my regular curl routine: shampoo, conditioner, prayer hands curl cream, scrunch mouse, and air dry. however, my curls fell flat immediately and were slightly wavy. i was concerned at first but i looked it up and it seemed normal that my hair would take a second to bounce back (no pun intended haha) anyways, a month passes by and at this point im concerned because my curls are still falling flat (not that they’re forming properly in the first place) and they’re just a bit wavy. this is when i purchase blue and yellow skala leave in conditioner. i would use the yellow in the shower and the blue as a leave in (i would also switch and do only yellow some days then only blue some days but it turned out the same). i didn’t see any improvement so I bought Mielle Rosemary Mint Strengthening Hair Mask, which was recommended to me by cousin with similar curl patterns as me. I’ve been using tat hair mask for a month now and still, little to no improvement. At this point, i’m convinced that my hair will never recover from whatever that lady did to my hair and i’m so so frustrated. both at myself for caving and allowing her to blow dry and straighten my hair, and at her for ruining my hair. Idk if any of you have had this happen to yall but i’ll take any advice at this point because im seriously desperate. My hair is straight in same areas and wavy in others.  it’s not dry, it’s quite soft so i don’t think it needs to be cut off. Also, i’m still using the exact same mousee, curl cream, shampoo, and conditioner that I used before i went to that salon. so yeah, do yall think there’s no going back? Oh and I would attach a picture of a before and after of my hair but i’m a hijabi so i can’t, thanks! ",

      "content": "Hey gang, just wanted to take a minute to thank this sub and the very detailed wiki for helping me find the solution to my acne problems.\n\nAbout two years ago I (f28) started getting really bad acne on my cheeks and chin, even worse than when I was a teenager. Hard pustules which rarely came to a head but were sore and red and I would pick at them constantly.\n\nAt the time my skincare routine was lackluster to say the least - cold water splashed on the face maybe once a day. I came to this subreddit for solutions and found a wealth of knowledge. \n\nI started out with a salicylic acid face wash and moisturizer (both CeraVe) twice a day and tried to give it a few months to work but didn't see much change. I thought the acne might be hormonal so I switched birth controls to one meant specifically for acne, but still no results, even after about 8 months. At that point I was a bit in limbo, afraid to integrate a new product and be disappointed or potentially make things worse. Mostly during this time I just tried to stick to a routine, use up the products I had already bought, and change out my pillow case more frequently.\n\nThis September I went back to the wiki and saw benzoyl peroxide as a potential acne deterrent - figured I'd give it a shot and I saw results right away! I got the 5% leave-on gel version and put it on each night before bed, sometimes with moisturizer to prevent drying. In the morning I washed my face with a simple gentle (again, CeraVe) cleanser + moisturizer. \n\nWithin two weeks my skin was much smoother, less inflamed, and the little scabs I had picked at for the last two years were healing nicely (Side shout-out to r/CompulsiveSkinPicking, for some good advice and community support). Now it's been about two month and the difference is really night and day! I still have some scarring and redness but nothing like before. I'm just very grateful to have found the right solution for me, and hope it continues. To note - I personally didn't experience any of the drying or clothes bleaching side effects of benzoyl peroxide, so also thankful for that. \n\nIt's been a real journey and has made me think a lot about my thoughts on aging, my appearance, how I perceive myself as I get older. I'm grateful to this community for collecting all the data I needed at the time and all the personal anecdotes from others. Thank you!\n\ntl;dr - had bad acne for about two years, this sub pointed me towards benzoyl peroxide and it worked like a charm. Thank you!",

      "content": "\nHey everyone!\n\nI’ve started getting lots of tiny bumps all over my forehead. It’s been around 1.5 weeks since they appeared and they’re not settling down.\n\nI recently started using the Re’equil Oil-Free Moisturiser (Hyaluronic Acid + Betaine) about 2 weeks ago, and I’m wondering if it could be the cause. My skin type is oily.\n\nAnother factor is that my sleep cycle has been disturbed lately. I’ve been sleeping irregularly for the past few days, so I’m not sure if that’s contributing too.\n\nDo these look like closed comedones or fungal acne? And if it’s from the moisturizer, should I stop it completely or try using it differently? Any suggestions on how to calm this down or improve skin texture would really help 🙏\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
