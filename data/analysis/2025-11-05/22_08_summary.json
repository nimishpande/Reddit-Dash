      "content": "Hi!\nI'm curious how to achieve this bouncy, falling into forehead type of front/bangs, while keeping the rest of the hair looking natural and wavy/frizzy? \nIs it heat styling? Because it looks so slick, but when I try to heat style the front of my hair, I have to do the whole lenght or otherwise it looks bad.\nI have less hair than her but the same type. What most bothers me is that in the front i have baby hairs and making my hair fall more into my forehead seems impossible. :/ I tried with a straightener, small curlers, big curlers...\n\nAny tips? Thank you!",

The Formularx Sun Relief Ceramide Silk Hydrating SPF 50 / PA++++\n\nThis is good. Hydrating, silky, zero white cast, and somehow makes your skin feel like it just got back from a facial.\n\nVerdict: 9/10\n\n\n\n3. Fixderma Shadow SPF 50\n\nMore like Thickderma. Great protection, but the texture could double as cake batter.\n\nIf you’re oily-skinned, this will have you looking like you moisturized with candle wax.\n\nVerdict: Best for dry skin winters only.\n\n\n\n4. Re’equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch\n\nMatte? Yes. Dry touch? Sure. Comfortable? That’s a no.\n\nIt’s like applying successively smaller layers of chalk.\n\nBut hey, it’s one of the few that actually controls sweat.\n\nVerdict: Good for Athletes. Functional, not romantic.\n\n\n\n5.

I wanted to ask if this routine was actually helpful.\nI have large pores and I am prone to small breakouts. Nothing too severe, but annoying. My skin is not too greasy or too dry but somewhere in the middle.\n\nIn the morning I use:\n- Salicylic Acid Based Cleanser\n- Salicylic Acid Tonic\n- Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer\n- Sometimes, sunscreen (I live in an area with very low sunlight and the primer I wear has FPS protection)\n\nIn the night I use:\n-Micellar water (this is also my make up remover)\n- Salicylic Acid Based Cleanser\n- Salicylic Acid Tonic\n- Retinol Tonic\n- Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer. \n\nI exfoliate twice a week.\n\nI do notice a little bit of a burning sensation during the night after applying the Salicylic Acid Tonic followed by the Retinol and I am not sure if they should be together at all. I mainly want to use retinol for small lines and wrinkles on my forehead that I am starting to notice, as well as my smile lines.\n\nMy skin doesn’t look or feel irritated so far but I am worried about that burning. My skin does feel softer and healthier but idk if thats just the moisturizer doing the heavy lifting.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

      "content": "Long story short, I took oral Fin for 7 years until it seemed to lose efficacy.  I have been on oral Dut for almost 3 years and still losing ground quickly.  I have a constant itch in the balding areas but my derm has confirmed that there is no inflammation, no dermatitis, no dandruff, etc.  My derm has suggested that my genetics are simply pulling me down the baldness path and that he can't help any further (I'm also using keto shampoo, laser cap).  Other than increased estradial, my bloodwork is all good.  I've been considering a topical adunct treatment such as Pyrilutamide or Alfatradiol but I'm not sure why one might work better than another.  When I research both products, both seem to offer a different type of assistance.  For an itch and constant miniaturization, why would one work better than the other?  Curious if anyone else had to make a similar decision and how it went.  ",

      "content": "I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I can’t think of a better place. But how do I get a shower routine that I actually enjoy? I love feeling and smelling good, and having a good routine. I used to really enjoy showering and taking baths before my chronic illness got worse. I have very low energy and being autistic makes the sensory aspect of showering worse. As of right now I’m also 2 weeks post op for a hysterectomy and that has been so wild.\n\nAt some point showering just became a matter of how fast I can get in and out while still getting myself clean. I don’t want to be that way anymore. I want things to be more intentional with bathing and not cry every time I’m in the shower because I’m cold then wet, hot and then wet, cold and wet again, cold and dry, etc etc. It’s so distressing and I feel icky. I want to invest more time into a nice routine. Maybe not pull out all the bells and whistles right away. But right now all I do is use shampoo for everything, then lotion, and deodorant.\n\nI have a few skincare products I use after showering but it’s just a serum and moisturizer. I have more skincare products (double cleanser, essence, toner) I just find it hard to do the whole thing and be excited about it- or at the very least not dreading it.\n\nI see all this stuff in the shower aisle and get overwhelmed, but it’s intriguing at the same time. I wanna be one of those girls who always smells so good and has soft skin and nice hair.\n\nPlease help me put together a list of a few products to get soon, and how to do everything properly. I feel really pathetic right now. Here’s some things I know I like about products (that’s such weird phrasing my brain is mush. I hope I’m making sense)\nI like things that have a good lather but leave my skin not too dry\nI like lotion (love it) but not stuff that leaves me feeling too greasy. Light body oils are okay too.\nI like sweet smells, more berry and floral than vanilla though. \nI prefer exfoliating without a body scrub. I hate the gritty feeling.\n\nI should also add I’m a huuuuuge perfume girly. My favorites are YSL Flowers &amp; Flames and Marc Jacobs Perfect Absolute. I just tend to only wear it when I go out because it’s expensive. But I’m also not going anywhere lately lol. Maybe time to invest in some body mists to do after everything else? \n\nI’m sorry again for the weird request. Thank you, and I hope you all are having a good day :)\n\n",

Years ago i used salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide and absolutely ruined my skin with it. Definitely got rid of the acne but ruined my barrier. After going back to basics i healed my barrier but of course the cystic acne came back eventually.\n\nI'm looking to start retinol for my closed comedones, general acne and fine lines but im aware that this is a slippery slope with sensitive skin. I'm also planning on keeping retinol away from my eczema. I also already have an spf that i would use with retinol.\n\nI'd like recommendations on both a day and night routine. i'm looking for:\n\n• moisturisers\n• if i need to use any serums?\n• eye cream that's not too heavy but super moisturising\n• retinol products for sensitive skin",

Leave in oil\n8. Dry(but not really)\n9. Put in a pineapple looking way and sleep with it cuz I don't have time to dry it\n\nTo be honest, I am just really new to curly hair in general. Since I was young I've been told my hair is wavy in some way, but I was never taught how to even care for wavy hair, so obviously, I don't know how to deal with curly hair either. You can imagine how my hair, which was treated as straight hair would react to that, getting so frizzy and looking terrible. \n\n I've started learning about curly hair this summer. Started following routines and all: Tried just shampooing with normal shampoo I used before and defusing and hair looked like (picture 1), then I tried finger coiling it, which gave it texture but didn't give me what I wanted (picture 2). Over time, I got a new shampoo, a curl cream and a conditioner. So far, that's all I have. It would probably be enough, though I need a gel too, but it's getting better. \n\nThe biggest problem I have right now is learning how to style it cuz scrunching doesn't work perfectly for me, learning how to dry it without a diffuser(cuz the one I had dissapeared= was thrown out by someone who didn't know what it's used for) and learning how to sleep with it. \n\nI've tried hair plopping and that went terrible. For the past few weeks I've been using the pineapple sth method(T shirt and my hair is tied on the top of my head with a scrunchy). It's not great, but, better than most stuff I've tried. Help me out girlies. \n\nSome times my hair kind of coils up. I wish it did that in all the hair but it usually is happening only in the backside of my hair. They're cute though. I wish all of my hair looked like that, all of it.\n\nEven if you don't help I'll still have curly hair, I just won't know what to do with it. Btw, been trying to grow my hair in years. It never reached past my shoulders, but now after using hair oil and some scalp massage it reached past them 🫡 ",

I do the same routine with the same products but get so much more definition and bounce when I diffuse vs air-dry. Sometimes, I really don’t want to spend all that time diffusing and let my hair just dry on its own. \n\nI have SUPER thick hair. It was way curlier when I was a kid and got wavy (and now almost straight when air-drying) as an adult. Do I really just have much straighter hair now and the diffuser is creating an illusion of waves/curls? Or could I get a similar look with different products / methods. \n\nCurrent routine is put curl cream on when it’s soaking wet out of the shower (I use Garnier Fructis Curl Air Dry Cream, just combing it through with my fingers), scrunch in a gel (I usually use one either by Sebastian (the Texturizer Liquidgel) or the Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Gel), let it fully dry (I usually either micro-plop or plop in a microfiber towel or t-shirt) and then put a little serum on to control any frizz (I like the John Freida Frizz Ease Serum). Sometimes I swap out the gel for a mouse (got 2b Twisted by Schwarzkopf) but usually need a gel for more hold. \n\n",

They’re like type 2C in the front but in the back it’s more like type 2B.\n\nFor my routine I just section my hair in half, and apply a curl enhancing product (like a cream or a foam) then I finish off with any hold product that’ll give a cast (a gel typically) and diffuse or air dry.\n\nI typically sleep with my hair in a pineapple under a bonnet. It does a great job at maintaining my curls. But the front of my hair and curtain bangs often get stretched out from the scrunchie meaning I have to redo them in the morning, which is frustrating.\n\nI’ve tried just putting my hair in the bonnet with no scrunchie, but it didn’t work and just made my hair look like a mess. I’ve also tried sleeping with a scarf, but it gives me a headache and also causes my curls to get messed up.\n\nDoes anyone know of any other methods of sleeping with loose curly/wavy hair, or am I just going to have to get used to refreshing in the morning 🥲",

It feels terrible and just seems to swing from one end of the spectrum (dry and frizzy) to the other (product-overloaded and crunchy).\n\nThis all has the caveat, of course, of me not really knowing what I'm doing.\n\nAnyway, the above routine is what I ended up with after trying a whole bunch of different products recommended to me by family members. It still refused to obey, though, so I got sick of it all - my hair got so frizzy and dry and terribly uncooperative that I buzzed it short.\n\nWhat I'm asking for, I guess, are general tips? I want my hair to grow and grow *well*, into something that is at least more co-operative. I don't want my hair to be dry and frizzy, as is its usual state, but I don't want to overload it with products such that it's crunchy just to give it shape / flatten it. If anybody here is South Asian, well, so am I (and so's my 2C-3A hair lol) - I'm uncomfortable sharing pictures of myself online.\n\nObviously my hair is too short to do anything major with *now*, but general tips would be nice. Knowledge about things like shampoos, conditioners, and oils. Whether I should do anything now to avoid split ends / damaged hair down the line. I just really want my hair to actually look halfway decent for once lol.\n\nThank you!",

I'm really struggling to find a good routine for this, so would love to know what others do.\n\nIf I use self-tanner in the evening, the smell gets into my bed sheets which I hate. But if I do it in the morning before work, I go to work reeking of self-tanner and am self-conscious about it! \n\nI even tried using gradual tanner lotion instead, thinking the concentration was lower and it therefore wouldn't stink as much. I tried the Garnier apricot gradual tan one, and while it smelled nice initially, as soon as the apricot fragrance was gone, the horrible self-tanner smell was back!\n\nI really can't figure out how to fit it into a routine where I can get rid of the smell asap, any suggestions welcome!

I have extremely oily skin, still have issues with acne (although not nearly as bad as it used to be, it’s pretty much gone now except for the occasional breakout) and now I’m having issues with my scalp.\n\nFor a while I was washing my hair every other day, and occasionally every 3 days. I was under the impression that this was best for my type of hair/skin. Well about a year ago, I started noticing that my scalp smells like fungus. I first noticed by noticing the smell on my pillow, and then I started rubbing my fingers through my hair/scalp, and the smell was bad. This has been an ongoing issue for about a year. Well, a few weeks ago, I decided to start washing my hair every day to see if it changes anything. It didn’t. Actually, it got even worse. I blow dry my hair completely, and it smells good (like the shampoo) for the remainder of the day, but the next day it starts smelling horrible again. Before this, it would start smelling around the 2 day mark. \n\nDoes anyone know what could be causing this, and what I can do? Btw the shampoo I use has tea tree oil in it, which has been suggested to me, but it’s already in the shampoo I use.",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

There are dark marks left behind from old breakouts, and some areas just look patchy/darker than the rest of my skin. I’m not 100% sure if it’s purely acne, post-inflammatory marks or maybe something like fungal acne in some spots.\n\nCan you please suggest:\n• Products available in India that helped your body/back acne\n• Any creams/tubes that actually worked for pigmentation / dark marks\n• Body washes or treatment lotions that made a visible difference\n\nI’m open to medicated products as well, just want to start with the right routine instead of randomly trying stuff.\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "content": "I’ve realized press on nails and me do not get along well. For whatever reason, nails that are supposed to last 1-2 weeks only last 1 day on me IF that. I have followed all the typical steps, filing and buffing my nail, using an alcohol wipe, even tried acetone at one point bc I heard it helped the glue with sticking (it didn’t). So I’m wondering, for those who have similar issues, what is your secret? I’ve read buying a protein bond and dehydrator together might work with helping the glue stay on at least a week or two, but I am hesitant to try anything considering nothing has ever worked for me. I typically go for the glamnetic fake nails but I’m literally taking them off easily by the next day if not a few hours later. Its frustrating because I’ve heard people (including friends and coworkers) rave about how their nails lasted weeks or they had to use a soak to get their nails off, meanwhile mine are falling off within hours (only exception is when I get them done at the salon). \n\nSo ladies, please help me. Am I going to be forced to forever go to the nail salon if I want nice long nails? I’d opt for painting my natural nails but as mentioned in the title I have wide nails which are kind of shaped like toes so I prefer fake nails lol. I am happy for anyone who is able to use a strong nail glue and have a good hold for weeks, but that is definitely not me. With all the glues I’ve tried I’ve accepted it’s me somehow. Thanks again to anyone who takes the time to respond in advance ",
