I scrunch it with salon line curling cream while it’s wet fresh out the shower. \n\n3. I finish scrunching it with curling cream then I come with an old T shirt of mine (only thing I have that I can dry my hair with that isn’t a crappy body towel) and I give it a few scrunches on the sides (not too much as to dry it just so it’s not dripping with water and curl cream). \n\nON A WASH DAY:\n\n1.

I have found two moisturizer that I do not react to which are\n\nSkinfix triple lipid barrier cream Naturium multi peptide moisturizer\n\nI am currently using the skin fix cream but I also don’t feel like it is helping my skin long term and making it more hydrated and less sensitive. Over top I sometimes put Clary balm by Clary which is an olive oil based balm. I have zero reaction to this product and it does not break me out.\n\nI do not have a cleanser but today I tried the Prequel gleanser and it has left my skin feeling tight and stinging, even after putting the skinfix on.\n\nA problem I typically have is that when I start using a new product, it feels amazing and super hydrating. After 4-5 days it will start making my face sting and also feel extremely congested on my cheeks/jawline. My face gets itchy and feels like there is heat trapped. An example of a product that has done that is the illiyoon ceramide moisturizer that is highly recommended. Maybe dimethicone bothers me?\n\nI am really looking for a routine that will leave me hydrated and with plump skin. My symptoms right now are dry/dehydrated, sensitive, itchy, red, prone to acne (from products), and tight skin. My skin also has texture and can feel congested, so I’d love to be able to exfoliate, but I realize it might not be a good time for that  due to the sensitivities I’m dealing with. Pleaseeee help me!

I don’t wear any makeup, just moisturizer and sunscreen daily.\n\nI’m trying to get back into a proper skincare routine, but I’m not sure what kind of face wash would work best for me. I want something that helps clear out clogged pores without making my skin more irritated or dry.\n\nAlso  would double cleansing actually help in my case? Since I only wear sunscreen and moisturizer, I’m not sure if it’s necessary or just extra.\n\nWould love any product recommendations or routines that worked for you if you have similar skin! ",

It’s been around 1.5 weeks since they appeared and they’re not settling down.\n\nI recently started using the Re’equil Oil-Free Moisturiser (Hyaluronic Acid + Betaine) about 2 weeks ago, and I’m wondering if it could be the cause. My skin type is oily.\n\nAnother factor is that my sleep cycle has been disturbed lately. I’ve been sleeping irregularly for the past few days, so I’m not sure if that’s contributing too.\n\nDo these look like closed comedones or fungal acne? And if it’s from the moisturizer, should I stop it completely or try using it differently? Any suggestions on how to calm this down or improve skin texture would really help 🙏\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

      "content": "I am looking for tips on styling/product recommendations for my hair. I've tried to start caring for my curls over the last year and I'm still struggling to figure out what I need to do.\n\nThe routine:\n\n1. I soak my hair in warm water and then detangle my hair with a Tangle Teezer Brush intermittently throughout the next steps.\n2. L'Oréal EverPure Sulfate Free Color Care System Clarify Shampoo (once a week)\n3. Cerave Anti-D@ndruff\\* Hydrating Shampoo (twice a week)\n4. Cerave Anti-D@ndruff\\* Hydrating Conditioner (twice a week)\n5. Not Your Mother's Naturals Daily Nutrition Butter Mask (twice a week, letting it sit for 7 minutes each time)\n6. I've tried both wringing out the majority of the water from my hair and leaving almost all of the water in my hair post-shower. Lately I've been doing the former. I follow with scrunching out any curls that are still dripping with a microfiber towel.\n7. I put a bit of Pantene Wave &amp; Curl Defining Hydrating Créme throughout my hair, following it with a small amount of Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Heat &amp; Humidity Gel.\n8. I style it with my D3 Denman brush. The best I can end up doing is huge sausage curls around my head with very little if any volume. \n9. 40 minutes under my hard hood dryer under low heat.\n10. Scrunch out the crunch with my microfiber towel.\n\nRefreshing: I mist my hair in the morning and try to curl it again with my Denman brush. Then I just let it air dry. This ends up with poofy/frizzy curls at best just hours later.\n\nSleeping: I don't do anything except sleep on a silk pillowcase. I've tried pineappling, and I've tried bonnets. I'm disappointed that the curls don't really maintain their shape overnight. I also seem to move too much during sleep to keep the scrunchies and/or bonnets on my head overnight, so I stopped using those.\n\nI tried doing the upside down, diffuse the hair tutorials from Manes by Mell and others. I flipped my hair back over (maybe too early) and ended up with a snake's nest of very wonky, crispy curls going every direction.\n\nProducts I have also tried:\n\n* Not Your Mother's Curl Cream\n* Not Your Mother's Beach Babe Sea Salt Spray (did not give any hold and made my top layer stringy)\n* Not Your Mother's 3 in 1 All Eyes on Me Styling Cream (no hold, seems made more for slicked back hairstyles?)\n* Multiple DevaCurl products (the one I liked most was the Plumping Primer, but I wasn't really impressed by their curl cream or gel)\n* Pantene Intensive Bond Repair Mask (this made my hair feel so soft after rinsing it out, but I read this brand isn't well liked?)\n* Pantene Miracle Rescue Regenerative Hair Oil (maybe I used too much, but it made my hands and hair feel like I almost had honey on/in it, which I didn't like)\n* Other products I have probably forgotten about\n\nI don't know what to do or use at this point, and I'd like tips/recommendations before spending more.\n\n(\\*@ so the post doesn't get auto removed)",

To make matters worse, I’m not particularly well-versed in makeup, so any advice is greatly appreciated. \n\nHere’s my question: what’s your favorite super cool light skin tint, CC cream, tinted moisturizer, etc? The thinner the better, I’m just looking to even out a little bit of redness. \n\nThank you so much! ♥️\n",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

The past week I’ve been exploring my natural hair, and need help with understanding what hair texture I have and how to best style it. My biggest issues are my hair feeling weighed down, and frizz \n\nMy current wash routine: \n- OGX Rosemary Mint Shampoo every 3rd day, - Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Conditioner \n- Redken Acidic Bonding leave in conditioner\n\nFirst photo is an air dry photo using OGX Coconut Curls\n\nThe second is a photo of my hair using Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Mousse and Diffuser (I didn’t love how the mousse made my hair feel, but I could have used too much product) \n\nLast photo is of my hair when it’s wet straight from the shower \n\n\nI have medium-thick density but the hair strands themselves are on the finer side. Any recommendations for products for men’s hair that are lightweight? I’m a total newbie so any help is appreciated! ",
