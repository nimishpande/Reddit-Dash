I have a constant itch in the balding areas but my derm has confirmed that there is no inflammation, no dermatitis, no dandruff, etc.  My derm has suggested that my genetics are simply pulling me down the baldness path and that he can't help any further (I'm also using keto shampoo, laser cap).  Other than increased estradial, my bloodwork is all good.  I've been considering a topical adunct treatment such as Pyrilutamide or Alfatradiol but I'm not sure why one might work better than another.  When I research both products, both seem to offer a different type of assistance.  For an itch and constant miniaturization, why would one work better than the other?

I don’t dye, and rarely use styling tools. Air dry only. Are these split ends? Or the way my hair just looks now? \n\n\nI want to be happy about my hair cut but now my hair just looks ratty, stringy, &amp; unhealthy.

But here I am, desperately needing a solution to what's happening.\n\nI have never really cared about these types of things, because I just had way too much fun being a bratty kid, even until now. If a dermatologist saw my actions, they would probably see hell on earth. Everytime I had some sort of blurt in my face, I just plucked or scratched it off. Yes, I knew it was definitely a bad choice, but that was when I was very much still careless. Plus, my parents didn't know what to do with me, being a lazy teen.\n\nNow, I just woke up with a single huge pimple on my chin, and an army of dark, scab-like (?) results left from the acne/pimple where I used to scratch off my forehead. Although It isn't an award-worthy type of bad. I still think I need to make a move before it becomes worse.\n\nCan anybody please give me some advice? Like,  What type of routine should I stick with? What should I avoid doing? What type of skincare  products here in the Philippines are good and/or cheap? \n\n",

Before, they only showed when I’ve been eating out a lot but now they’re consistently there. Could it be from my lactose intolerance or iron deficiency?

I mostly have dry skin except I’m oily on these two problem zones (T zone area). \n\nMy current skin routine is\n- oil cleanser on my t zone (kose)\n- gentle skin cleanser (cetaphil)\n- cosrx aha/bha toner\n- cosrx snail mucin 92 or equate/ponds dry skin facial cream\n- bondi sands sunscreen",

My skin has been stable and ok since i restarted the regimen but i am much more careful now.\n\nSo what happened yesterday was i planned to start going to the pool again so i skipped any actives in the morning. I went swimming in the afternoon and washed my face in the shower and lotioned up after with the usual gentle stuff.\n\nHOURS later at home totally totally dry from the pool and shower, i put on the az with the plan to just use that and skip the retinol that night. Well it stung like a bitch which usually only happens if i use it within 30 mins of washing my face. Remember it's been HOURS. Then this morning my skin is red, irritated, and mildly swollen.\n\nClearly something reacted with the pool. Retinol the night before? Az the day of? Wtf happened and how do swimming peeps handle these products?? I'll be so pissed if i wrecked my skin barrier again so suddenly or if i can't swim and use these things at all :(",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

Sometimes, I really don’t want to spend all that time diffusing and let my hair just dry on its own. \n\nI have SUPER thick hair. It was way curlier when I was a kid and got wavy (and now almost straight when air-drying) as an adult. Do I really just have much straighter hair now and the diffuser is creating an illusion of waves/curls? Or could I get a similar look with different products / methods. \n\nCurrent routine is put curl cream on when it’s soaking wet out of the shower (I use Garnier Fructis Curl Air Dry Cream, just combing it through with my fingers), scrunch in a gel (I usually use one either by Sebastian (the Texturizer Liquidgel) or the Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Gel), let it fully dry (I usually either micro-plop or plop in a microfiber towel or t-shirt) and then put a little serum on to control any frizz (I like the John Freida Frizz Ease Serum). Sometimes I swap out the gel for a mouse (got 2b Twisted by Schwarzkopf) but usually need a gel for more hold. \n\n",
