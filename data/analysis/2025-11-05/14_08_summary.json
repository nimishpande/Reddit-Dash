For reference my hair is board straight, like it air dries straighter than some people after a straightener. So I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing with my daughter’s curly hair. \n\nI’ve got good product I think, color wow spray. And I know to spray it wet before brushing (now…) but halfway through the day it’s always frizzy and the curls fall out and lately she’s getting BAD knots and some matting. The day starts good but I’m clearly doing something wrong. \n\nWe wash it 3 times a week, more or less is better? We use fairy tails curly Q shampoo conditioner, is that good? Does she need a silk pillowcase? Some kind of bonnet (if she’d even wear it)? Do I need an unbrush? Why is it so frizzy halfway through the day and how do I fix it?",

I did a patch test before because I have fairly sensitive skin (but truth to be told, I only heard about the sandwich method after I've began showing weird symptoms) and my skin was fine. After I've used it, on the next day I've had a little bit of redness on my cheeks so I dropped it and went back to just double cleansing, moisturizer and sunscreen. The second day (yesterday) the redness and itchiness became even worse, but it subsided by the time I was about to go to sleep, so I thought my skin might be calming down. Then this is how I woke up this morning (see pictures).\nI'm hoping it's visible enough, but my skin is very red and irritated, it is warm to the touch, itching like CRAZY, and I have very small whiteheads on my nose and forehead. Is this a 'retinol purge' or something else entirely? Any tips on how to soothe my skin would be very much appreciated as I am honestly freaking out.🫠\n\nMy current routine: Anua heartleaf cleansing oil, Anua HA8 + panthenol gentle foaming cleanser, Purrito mighty bamboo panthenol cream, Skin1004 hyalu-cica sunscreen.",

All of this has lead to a lot of hair fall. I used to have thick, long hair and now I’m left with barely a third of it. \n\nI tried rosemary oil, hoping it would help with regrowth, but it only caused more shedding so I stopped using it. Everything I read suggests “managing stress” and “regulating your nervous system” but I don’t know where to start. \n\nI’d like to focus on: \n\n1. Learning how to regulate my nervous system and manage stress \n\n2. Regrowing my hair\n\nIf anyone has any advice for me, I’d be so very grateful 🌸",

My skin always looked tired, patchy, and lifeless.\n\nFinally, I went to a dermatologist, and that changed everything. He examined my skin and told me something I never realized constant tret and hydroquinone was actually irritating my skin, keeping it inflamed and stopping it from healing. He took me off it completely and started me on a new plan with oral tranexamic acid and a 4-peel treatment cycle — two Nomelan Fenol Light  (the deeper ones) and two Colombia peels (milder and brightening), one each month to give my skin time to recover and slowly lift pigmentation. For maintenance, he prescribed Cosglo and Depimax Serum\n\nI also told him how I had tried every “good” moisturizer CeraVe, Cetaphil, La Roche Posay, Laneige  and nothing ever made my skin feel hydrated. He smiled and told me to use Venusia Max, which costs around ₹600, and honestly it’s been a miracle. My skin finally feels calm, plump, and genuinely moisturized, something even the expensive ones never managed.\n\nI’ve just finished my first Nomelan Fenol Light peel a week back , and my face looks so fresh and smooth. The melasma patches have softened, my texture feels refined, and that constant tired look is gone.\n\nAfter years of experimenting and wasting money, I’ve realized how powerful a good dermatologist can be.

We never really noticed any issues with our skin until the past couple of months I've developed crazy itchiness over my body- completely random. An itchy scalp that just always feel inflamed and itchy. When I scratch my skin it becomes red(way more than normal) and then about 30mins later goes away. Both me and my wife's skin just seems like we've aged way more than what we are supposed to look like at 36 years old  \n  \nSomeone pointed out to me that it might be my our hard water causing this and I tried oats bath and it made a massive difference in the skin feeling so much better. But I am still getting these symptoms on a daily basis even after 2 weeks of using this approach. It's definitely better, but still there on a daily basis. Unsure how long this takes to completely get better?  \n  \nHas anyone else had such a crazy response after such a long time of exposure or is this something else? Any advice how to help our skin moving forward besides the usual 'oats bath'?  \n  \nThank you,  \n",

      "content": "I got my hair cut on Saturday.  My husband and I have been seeing the same guy for ages and he always kills it with my hair!  Don't know what happened this time.  Maybe we got to talking and we just weren't paying attention, maybe I just didn't notice it before I left the salon, I don't know.  I'm usually really good about saying \"Hey, this looks a little off, can we fix it?\" if I see something that doesn't look right, so this is definitely an oversight on my part, not my barber's.\n\nI usually wear my hair down, but the first picture shows kinda what my bangs look like right now with my hair up.  Second pic is how I normally wear it, I ran my fingers through it and positioned it to where you can see the lack of angle or blending.  Third pic was taken earlier this year.  I chose that one specifically because that was exactly one week after getting it cut and it's grown out a bit.  Notice how the bangs are blended and tapered.  Same barber.\n\nMy question is... What do I do here?  I feel like there's not enough length on them right now to properly cut and shape them, but they're really bothering me (I'm also luetal right now, so every tiny thing is driving me absolutely banana sandwich).  My husband doesn't go back for a haircut for another three weeks (we go together), so I'm looking at possibly having to deal with this until the 22nd.",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",
