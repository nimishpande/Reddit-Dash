For reference my hair is board straight, like it air dries straighter than some people after a straightener. So I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing with my daughter’s curly hair. \n\nI’ve got good product I think, color wow spray. And I know to spray it wet before brushing (now…) but halfway through the day it’s always frizzy and the curls fall out and lately she’s getting BAD knots and some matting. The day starts good but I’m clearly doing something wrong. \n\nWe wash it 3 times a week, more or less is better? We use fairy tails curly Q shampoo conditioner, is that good? Does she need a silk pillowcase? Some kind of bonnet (if she’d even wear it)? Do I need an unbrush? Why is it so frizzy halfway through the day and how do I fix it?",

I used tretinoin, hydroquinone, AHA/BHA peels, vitamin C, and at least 10 bottles of Eucerin, and I wore sunscreen every single day. Still, my melasma didn’t move. My skin always looked tired, patchy, and lifeless.\n\nFinally, I went to a dermatologist, and that changed everything. He examined my skin and told me something I never realized constant tret and hydroquinone was actually irritating my skin, keeping it inflamed and stopping it from healing. He took me off it completely and started me on a new plan with oral tranexamic acid and a 4-peel treatment cycle — two Nomelan Fenol Light  (the deeper ones) and two Colombia peels (milder and brightening), one each month to give my skin time to recover and slowly lift pigmentation. For maintenance, he prescribed Cosglo and Depimax Serum\n\nI also told him how I had tried every “good” moisturizer CeraVe, Cetaphil, La Roche Posay, Laneige  and nothing ever made my skin feel hydrated. He smiled and told me to use Venusia Max, which costs around ₹600, and honestly it’s been a miracle. My skin finally feels calm, plump, and genuinely moisturized, something even the expensive ones never managed.\n\nI’ve just finished my first Nomelan Fenol Light peel a week back , and my face looks so fresh and smooth. The melasma patches have softened, my texture feels refined, and that constant tired look is gone.\n\nAfter years of experimenting and wasting money, I’ve realized how powerful a good dermatologist can be.

      "title": "[Acne] Struggling with skincare - advice needed 🙏🏼",
      "content": "Hi! I am really needing help with my skincare routine, and any help would be greatly appreciated!!! This is super long, sorry!! \n\nTo start, I have somewhat (?) sensitive skin (not sure if I can still say this though, as a child my eczema was pretty bad but now I don’t think I have it at all. When I was in my teens (21 now) some scented products would make my face super bumpy and sometimes itchy, but as an adult I am able to use makeup/skincare products and not struggle with bumpiness, itchiness, or sensitivity.) I have combination skin that is more on the oily side for most of the year, but in the winter I can get kind of dry. \n\nMy main skincare concerns right now are what I believe to be closed and open comedones all over my face (concentrated near brows, on my nose, and on my chin, on cheeks frequently as well). I do get nodules/pimples(?) (Google university is my source) occasionally, but they usually show up around my cycle and when I eat a lot of sugar. \n\nI’ve been to the dermatologist multiple times, first I was prescribed benzoyl for my entire face and saw no difference. Early last year I was prescribed tretinoin (0.05) and used it (instructed to use it twice a week at first then increase) for about 2 months, but my face became so dry and flakey that it was painful, and even putting moisturizer on would make my skin feel sensitive. I started using it once a week, focusing on moisturizing for the rest of the week. Went back and shared that w/ the dr, got a 0.025 prescription and the dr said I needed to be using it at least twice a week to see results. Even with the lower prescription, the same dryness problem persisted when using it twice a week so I kind of just gave up on the tretinoin alone.\n\nWith all that being said, I decided to try using some new skincare products to address my concerns.\n\nMost recently, this is the skincare routine I’d been trying (for a little over 2 weeks):\n\nAnua Heartleaf Oil Cleanser (pm)\nCetaphil Fragrance Free Daily Facial Cleanser (am+pm)\nAnua Rice 70 Milk Toner (am+pm)\nMedicube Zero Pore Pads (1x week) (pm)\nTretinoin (1x week) (pm)\nCetaphil Hydrating Ceramide Serum w/ Cica + Allantoin (am+pm)\nAveeno Oat Gel Moisturizer (am+pm)\n\nI thought that spacing out the Medicube pads with the Tretinoin might help to clear up my skin without drying it out so much since the Pads have hydrating properties and I was adding in the Cetaphil serum. So far, I haven’t noticed any dryness, but I have noticed a bunch of little pimples (or maybe whiteheads with pus? Idk) all over my face recently. I thought at first when they were more sparse that it could be my skin purging a little, so I kept using all of the same products, but when I started looking into purging v. breaking out I read that purging usually takes place in typical problem areas (not the case for me). I stopped using the Anua products, which were the two main products I figured my skin would react poorly with. That was a couple days ago, so I am still waiting for my skin to clear up from the little pimples, but I have not noticed any new ones pop up, so I think I might have been correct in assuming it was one of those products. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or advice for how I could better address my skincare concerns, I would really appreciate the help!

We never really noticed any issues with our skin until the past couple of months I've developed crazy itchiness over my body- completely random. An itchy scalp that just always feel inflamed and itchy. When I scratch my skin it becomes red(way more than normal) and then about 30mins later goes away. Both me and my wife's skin just seems like we've aged way more than what we are supposed to look like at 36 years old  \n  \nSomeone pointed out to me that it might be my our hard water causing this and I tried oats bath and it made a massive difference in the skin feeling so much better. But I am still getting these symptoms on a daily basis even after 2 weeks of using this approach. It's definitely better, but still there on a daily basis. Unsure how long this takes to completely get better?  \n  \nHas anyone else had such a crazy response after such a long time of exposure or is this something else? Any advice how to help our skin moving forward besides the usual 'oats bath'?  \n  \nThank you,  \n",

But since switching to oral, it feels like I’ve completely stalled.\n\nHow is it possible to be a non-responder to oral when topical had some effect? I thought oral usually works better due to systemic absorption. Could genetics, enzyme differences, or dosage explain this?\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else has experienced something similar — and whether upping the dose helped or not.\n",

I’ve been using tat hair mask for a month now and still, little to no improvement. At this point, i’m convinced that my hair will never recover from whatever that lady did to my hair and i’m so so frustrated. both at myself for caving and allowing her to blow dry and straighten my hair, and at her for ruining my hair. Idk if any of you have had this happen to yall but i’ll take any advice at this point because im seriously desperate. My hair is straight in same areas and wavy in others.  it’s not dry, it’s quite soft so i don’t think it needs to be cut off. Also, i’m still using the exact same mousee, curl cream, shampoo, and conditioner that I used before i went to that salon. so yeah, do yall think there’s no going back? Oh and I would attach a picture of a before and after of my hair but i’m a hijabi so i can’t, thanks! ",

      "content": "\nHey everyone!\n\nI’ve started getting lots of tiny bumps all over my forehead. It’s been around 1.5 weeks since they appeared and they’re not settling down.\n\nI recently started using the Re’equil Oil-Free Moisturiser (Hyaluronic Acid + Betaine) about 2 weeks ago, and I’m wondering if it could be the cause. My skin type is oily.\n\nAnother factor is that my sleep cycle has been disturbed lately. I’ve been sleeping irregularly for the past few days, so I’m not sure if that’s contributing too.\n\nDo these look like closed comedones or fungal acne? And if it’s from the moisturizer, should I stop it completely or try using it differently? Any suggestions on how to calm this down or improve skin texture would really help 🙏\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

On the other side, I’m not so sure, but one parent has wavy hair (roughly 2B) As a toddler, my hair was curly, and my mother straightened my hair once it started growing out. Around 6-7 months ago, I wanted to try styling it naturally, but wasn’t really sure how. I’ve been tweaking my routine throughout that time, but I want to lock down anything I’m doing wrong. I don’t think I’m styling it correctly, so I’m not sure if I have wavy or curly hair. Here’s my routine:\n\n1. Double shampoo w/ Giovanni Castor Oil Shampoo (when clarifying I use Mane n’ Tail clarifying shampoo)\n\n2. Condition w/ Giovanni Castor Oil Conditioner\n\n3. Detangle w/ wide tooth comb\n\n4. Rinse well, but leave a small amount of conditioner in hair\n\n5. Section hair from crown and two halves\n\n6. Glaze Sun Bum Styling Cream through each half, then comb it through\n\n7. Scrunch \n\n8. Repeat process with crown\n\n9. tie up w/ pineapple bun in bonnet\n\nI usually diffuse, but this time I didn’t because I find that drying naturally yields better results.\n\nIf I’m not doing this right, can someone tell me what to do and suggest some products? Thank you!\n\n(by the way I’m only a teenager so I’m pretty new to this stuff)\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
