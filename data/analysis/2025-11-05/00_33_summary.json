      "content": "I have never used a cleanser, cream, moisturizer, or sunscreen because my parents don’t want to buy them for me. I can’t work because I’m still a minor, and I live in Mexico where the pay is terrible — around $25 USD a day. On top of that, they purposely make skincare products really expensive here.\n\nMy mom has a remote job that pays well, but she still refuses to buy me even the basics. I’ve told her that I want to see a dermatologist because my face, back, chest, and arms have blackheads, pimples, and whiteheads. But she always says no — she thinks dermatologists are a scam and that they just want to sell expensive chemicals.\n\nInstead, she tells me to use Jabón Zote, which has a really high pH, and Vicks VapoRub, which can clog pores. That’s what I’m using right now, but my skin feels the same or even worse. She insists it’s the “best skincare” and that it’s an old home remedy.\n\nMy dad doesn’t spend a single cent on me either. I used to have naturally fair skin, but now I’m really tanned and uneven — my face, arms, and legs are darker, while the rest of my body is still lighter. It looks ugly and makes me feel insecure. I got tanned because my parents always send me to the store when the sun is at its strongest.\n\nI just want to have clear and healthy skin, but I feel like I can’t do anything about it.",

I scrunch it with salon line curling cream while it’s wet fresh out the shower. \n\n3. I finish scrunching it with curling cream then I come with an old T shirt of mine (only thing I have that I can dry my hair with that isn’t a crappy body towel) and I give it a few scrunches on the sides (not too much as to dry it just so it’s not dripping with water and curl cream). \n\nON A WASH DAY:\n\n1. On a wash day I use the shampoo in the provided image followed by the conditioner which I let sit in for 5 minutes or so then rinse.\n\n2. I repeat the same process as on a non wash day. \n\nMy natural hair is leaning very hard towards thin 3c so I do a hair moisturizing process and “loosening” with a hair stylist once every 4 month’s.\n\nI know this isn’t the smartest choice and my routine sucks but my natural hair is not able to be saved trust me I’ve tried all and more. \n\nThat’s it thanks for reading  \n",

My ADHD makes it even more difficult, so I'm trying to give myself an easier alternative without shaming myself.\n\nIs there something I could do that is a \"better than nothing\" alternative on days when I just can't get myself to fully cleanse and wash (ex. face wipes, micellar water on a pad)?

I am still really struggling with styling it in the mornings (I usually shower and hair plop at night) because when I wake up it looks insane (sidenote: by the time I got to bed it's dry, but it looks psychotic either way). \n\nIn the morning, the hair closest to my head does a weird wave - kind of like the flapper's finger waves, but the bottom is a completely different (poofy) texture. If I brush it out it just gets even more poofy on the bottom and frizzy close to my head. **I'm looking for recs for quickly styling it without showering all over again in the morning.**\n\nI recently tried putting mousse in my dry hair and then pulling it up into a large clip and and bobby pinning the side pieces back from my face. I also tried putting a small rubber band in to make a top pony. I really don't like having it up in a hair tie because it hurts my head over the course of the day so other options are preferable. I'd love your recommendations!\n\n[I let my hair dry naturally without scrunching or plopping](https://preview.redd.it/06hiv0z88azf1.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6e419a1ee597632d2fb71608604d51a85a1b21e)\n\n[Let hair dry naturally without scrunching or plopping](https://preview.redd.it/6of2p0z88azf1.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68a0dc1144aef870efc031079bb6c6e61db88774)\n\n[ Added Amika plus size mousse to dry hair and put in a small band at the top](https://preview.redd.it/thcyc0z88azf1.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1682dbf2a590db53b0aa34265e80684c8d38be80)\n\n[ Added Amika plus size mousse to dry hair](https://preview.redd.it/ffipg0z88azf1.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fda29df946beb35972ce75e0ded4c34f11ea6e4e)",

It’s been around 1.5 weeks since they appeared and they’re not settling down.\n\nI recently started using the Re’equil Oil-Free Moisturiser (Hyaluronic Acid + Betaine) about 2 weeks ago, and I’m wondering if it could be the cause. My skin type is oily.\n\nAnother factor is that my sleep cycle has been disturbed lately. I’ve been sleeping irregularly for the past few days, so I’m not sure if that’s contributing too.\n\nDo these look like closed comedones or fungal acne? And if it’s from the moisturizer, should I stop it completely or try using it differently? Any suggestions on how to calm this down or improve skin texture would really help 🙏\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

Underated Multipurpose Toning Solution – 8% Glycolic Acid + 1% Salicylic Acid + 1% GDL\n\n\n2. The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner\n\n\n3. WishCare AHA + BHA Body Lotion – 10% AHA blend + 1% Salicylic Acid + Niacinamide\n\n\n4. Dr. Sheth’s Lactic Acid Body Lotion\n\n\n\nMy goal: even out tan lines / fade dullness on arms &amp; legs (not face).\n\nIf you’ve tried any of these — which gave you the best visible results for tan removal or smoother skin?\nOr if there’s a pharmacy or derm-approved option that works better, please suggest 🙏\n\nWould really appreciate honest feedback (not influencer hype).\n",

There's definitely acne and probably something else rather new going on. The patches are dry, and they burn. Any time I wear makeup my skin just crisps under it. Despite the fact that patches are dry - new cystic acne spots appear on my face. \n\nAny products recommended to improve the texture, and patches I'm experiencing for now?\n\nMuch thanks in advance, I am desperate that almost 10 years later from when I started getting acne, around 20 years old, that my skin hates me still. \n\nPic in comments ",

I feel like the volume might be the issue 😅\n\nMy hair is fairly thick and wavy. I’d say I’m probably around a 2a or 2b. It’s very easily tamed with the blow dryer. Picture is 1 day post shower/blow dry.\n\nAt 31, I expected I would know what to do with my hair, but here we are!\n\nI usually just ask for a layered cut and just rock that until the layers grow out.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I like that haircut on me, but I was curious if anyone could think of something that would be more flattering. I’ve been curious about curtain bangs, but I feel like my forehead is way too small for bangs.\n\nI’m open to suggestions and I appreciate anyone who took the time to read my rambling!",

      "content": "Hello! I have recently switched from tret 0.05% to differin adapalene gel for acne. I was using tret for almost a year and it did work at first, but a few months later, I noticed it was not doing anything for me. It was actually causing more breakouts and texture. So I tried adapalene gel, and I love the results, but it has given me pretty bad swollen under eyes. I already kinda have dark circles, but when I use the gel, it gives me flare ups of red, swollen under eyes that itch and make my dark circles look worse 😭 I don’t apply it directly under my eyes and I make sure I apply the gel a few cm away from my eye and I always add a thick layer of barrier cream right beneath my eyes, but it just doesn’t help. I still wake up with reddish, irritated undereyes. I tried aquaphor and vaseline, but for some reason that seemed to make the irritation worse. Is this a sign to just stop the gel and just let my skin get better naturally or try a different routine? My routine for the night is:\n\nSoonjung Toner\n\nDr. G hyal cica serum\n\nSoonjung 2x Barrier cream\n\nDifferin gel (1x-2x a week)\n\nand for the day:\n\nSoonjung Toner\n\nDear Klairs Midnight Blue serum\n\nSkin 1004 centella poremizing gel\n\nSkin 1004 sunscreen",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
