      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "So basically this treatment is being hyped up as it’s actually a natural protein found in your body that helps seal immune responses and counter inflammation. People who lack this protein cannot resolve inflammation anywhere in the body. It was initially being used as a treatment to speed up wound healing and it worked remarkably, leaving no identifiable scar tissue. Studies showed that in the healed areas, there was actually new hair follicles. The idea is that as an anti - inflammatory response it sends actually makes NEW follicles, a process known as Neogenesis. Now while the initial and published studies are done on mice, some studies were done on human tissues and actually showed similar results, with new hair follicles producing hairs and actively being in anagen. This protein also prolongs the anagen phase as it imcfeasss growth factors like EGF and VEGF and decreases TGFB-1. It also prevents apoptosis or cell death, which is usually what ends the anagen phase. Now while this is far away, the company actually released a cosmetic product that will be available December 15, but at the insane price of 15,000€ per liter I mean that’s insane. ",

I have tried vitamin c, caffeine solution and similar eye creams which did not really work. I used retinol and it helps only slightly. Even concealer cannot fully cover them and my veins are sometimes visible. I know these can be fixed with fillers and fat transfer but its quite expensive.\n\nI am getting enough sleep, drinking plenty of water, my iron levels should be good so i think I have covered that... I did microneedling with dermaroller 0.25 around the eyes - it also helps just slightly. I have been thinking about trying volufiline next from oridinary... or maybe hylauronic acid, so I need advice.\n\nPS: I know these cannot really be fully fixed without fillers, but I would like to at least try to reduce this or slow it down because If they are this bad now, I can't imagine how will they look when I actually start losing volume later 😭 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8qx5aiia024g1.jpg?width=811&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff498a2b78304e57de95aa6cc6dd1ddd3571e6ca",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "title": "[Routine Help] My skin feels tight after moisturizing",
      "content": "As the title reads, my skin feels tight after moisturizing, and I feel like i’m in a downhill battle with my skin. \n\nLet me give a little back story: about two months ago, I decided to use The Ordinary mandelic acid because my skin is oily and dehydrated, and I wanted to try to use something to help with my acne, pores, and texture on my skin. From talking to some people, it seemed like mandelic acid would be a safe choice for me to try to use because when I tried using Paula’s Choice BHA, it did not go well. So, I was using the mandelic acid 2-3 times a week. I know skin can purge in the beginning, so I was very open minded to it. Well, after a month, my skin just kept breaking out and it got the point I was getting breakouts in spots I never had and as well developing cystic acne. I took a step back, discontinued the use of the mandelic acid in hopes my skin would start clearing up. \nWELL, my skin became super inflamed and red and irritated. I decided to go to Dr Google, was reading online, and came to the determination that I destroyed my skin barrier. I began using products like hyaluronic acid on damp skin, following up with Paula’s Choice barrier repair moisturizer. I as well added squalane oil some nights due to reading that it can help with moisturizing my skin. My skin started to feel better (not tight) but I felt like the texture and irritation/itchiness was getting worse. It doesn’t help that the weather is getting much more colder where I live and I’ve been stressed out due to countless exams in my nursing program. So I continue on with washing my face with Cerave hydrating foam cleanser, Cerave hyaluronic acid on damp skin, and following up with the Paula’s Choice barrier repair moisturizer (some nights adding squalane oil). As I continued on, it wasn’t getting any better, if anything, my skin kept getting worse. \nFinally, I decide to go to the dermatologist and turns out I have seborrheic dermatitis, and seems like the mandelic acid triggered it and the stress and cold weather keep flaring it up/making it not go away. I was told to simplify my routine, use hydrocortisone short term, and after a couple weeks of fixing the seb derm, go back to slowly reintroducing stuff such as the hyaluronic acid.\n\nCurrently this is my skin routine AM and PM: wash face with Vanicream gentle wash, apply a thin layer on the areas with Exederm (hydrocortisone), moisturize with Vanicream moisturizing cream. The hydrocortisone cream I’m allowed to do twice a day, and it’s for short term, so I’m currently on day 4 and was told max 10 days. As well, I can use the nizoral shampoo as a mask on my face for 5-7 minutes once a week. Now, the issue I’m having is that after moisturizing, my skin feels ok for 5 minutes, and then my forehead and cheeks begin to feel tight. I was told to hold off from using anything else to try to help heal the seb derm, but it’s uncomfortable this tight feeling especially since it just keeps on getting colder. \nTherefore, I wanted to know if something could be recommended for me to do something about this. I would go back to my dermatologist, but my copay is really high ($150) and I can’t afford to go back. And besides, the next availability isn’t until the new year. \n\nI’ve never had this issue occur to me before, and to be honest, it’s really messing with my self confidence. I feel super self conscious about this, and I just want my skin to be happy (seems like that’s too much to ask for). Any help would be great .. thank you!",

However I recently moved somewhere that freezes and can admit that is not always possible anymore. I have an OLD blow dryer that I use when I do diffuse but since it's Black Friday I figured now would be a good time to get a quality one. Does anyone have any recommendations on a good blow dryer? I'm willing to pay a decent price if it's a quality blowdryer. The less frizz the better. I have 3A hair if that makes a difference!\n\n  \nIt's saying I need to add a routine:\n\nSunday is my wash day, only day I shampoo (Deva Curl No-poo). I shower almost every day because of my job and the gym. \n\nNormal shower routine: Get my hair wet, condition (Deva Curl one conditioner), comb my hair with a wide tooth comb, rinse sparingly. Finger comb leave in conditioner in (Donna's Recipe Sweet Potato Pie Leave In) and curl cream (Deva Curl curl cream). While my hair is still sopping wet I will wide tooth comb it one more time to make sure the product is evenly distributed. Then I will use a curl brush on my hair in sections (sometimes I'll just skip this step), flip head over and add gel (Deva Curl ultra defining gel), scrunch with old cotton tshirt, dont touch until its time to \"scrunch the crunch\".
