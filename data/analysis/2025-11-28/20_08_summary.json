      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

People who lack this protein cannot resolve inflammation anywhere in the body. It was initially being used as a treatment to speed up wound healing and it worked remarkably, leaving no identifiable scar tissue. Studies showed that in the healed areas, there was actually new hair follicles. The idea is that as an anti - inflammatory response it sends actually makes NEW follicles, a process known as Neogenesis. Now while the initial and published studies are done on mice, some studies were done on human tissues and actually showed similar results, with new hair follicles producing hairs and actively being in anagen. This protein also prolongs the anagen phase as it imcfeasss growth factors like EGF and VEGF and decreases TGFB-1. It also prevents apoptosis or cell death, which is usually what ends the anagen phase. Now while this is far away, the company actually released a cosmetic product that will be available December 15, but at the insane price of 15,000€ per liter I mean that’s insane. ",

It's not the right gel and it's too late to return 🫠 \nCan we get more discrete packaging please? Have had this happen with curlsmith too but it was easy to return since I bought it at ulta when I lived in America. The girls at ulta have also handed me the wrong curlsmith gel when I've picked up orders for myself. I spent so long making sure I bought the right one just to buy the wrong one. 🙄 apparently they changed what the bottle looks like now but I don't know if that's just for this particular gel or all of their gels will still continue to look similar. I'm someone can can miss a single word. The lack of black should've given it away but I was at a point of irritation when buying because it was sold out in most places or I couldn't buy more than 2 at once etc. I need coloured labels man. Or totally different coloured bottles. I hope this gel survives my 2 hour fridgid walk on Monday freakin morning. Doubt the correct gel will come by Tuesday morning either for another appointment I have to walk to. I had just enough to rake through my root area in the back that's low porosity. The rest of my hair and roots is this flexible gel now. Great to have discovered this on a Friday evening rather than earlier in the week. the strong one gives me 4-5 days of hold whereas all other gels I've used give me only 2-3. The only flexible gel I've used before was loma and that gave me 6 hours of hold lmao. So we'll see how this goes. I hate dealing with my mophead so it's nice to deal with it a bit less. I don't know anyone here to give it away to, the other 2 are still sealed. Ugh. There goes another 45 euros.\n\nRoutine not relevant.\nDunno what tag I should've used seemed the most fitting lol.",

I have tried vitamin c, caffeine solution and similar eye creams which did not really work. I used retinol and it helps only slightly. Even concealer cannot fully cover them and my veins are sometimes visible. I know these can be fixed with fillers and fat transfer but its quite expensive.\n\nI am getting enough sleep, drinking plenty of water, my iron levels should be good so i think I have covered that... I did microneedling with dermaroller 0.25 around the eyes - it also helps just slightly. I have been thinking about trying volufiline next from oridinary... or maybe hylauronic acid, so I need advice.\n\nPS: I know these cannot really be fully fixed without fillers, but I would like to at least try to reduce this or slow it down because If they are this bad now, I can't imagine how will they look when I actually start losing volume later 😭 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8qx5aiia024g1.jpg?width=811&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff498a2b78304e57de95aa6cc6dd1ddd3571e6ca",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful.

I used to remove hair via waxing but it didn’t suit my skin. I also had to stop doing laser hair removal as it gave me recurring hives (but apart from that it was the best option).

After years of trying to figure out my skin I was in a great place, however my forehead gets so dry. I was using face reality cran peptide with Mara face oil on top. My forehead never breaks out, just still so dry.\n\nSo I switched to skinsceuticals triple lipid and it was not hydrating enough, gave me milia and eventually started to have tiny little pinprick sized pustules. So I stopped and went back to the face reality and Mara oil but still so dry. I eventually tried Tatcha dewy skin. My forehead was so hydrated but after a week I got those little pustules again. I tried to push through and they just got worse. Stopped that. Tried an anti fungal that just made it worse.\n\nWent down a fungal acne rabbit hole and tried the Eucerin cream everyone was raving about and that was fantastic for a week. Then the red pustules came back.\n\nFinally I went to the dermatologist who prescribed plexion wash and told me to use La Roche Posay hyaluronic acid + B5 serum and said it was probably a dermatitis. Right away I started getting one or 2 little pustules but they went away by the end of the day. My forehead was so hydrated and then bam 6 days in the worst the reaction has been. Like 10-20 little pustules. Stopped the LRP hyaluronic acid and just used the plexion and my normal moisturizer (face reality cran peptide).\n\nMy skin was literally peeling off and painful so I added The Ordinary Hyaluronic and b5 serum since it’s fragrance free. Immediately my skin felt soothed and cleared up and was hydrated. Well that last 8 days when the little pustules just started to return. What in the world is going on!!!\n\nAny recommendations?\n\nFirst picture is reaction either LRP Hyaluronic Acid + B5 and second picture is day 2 of TO hyaluronic acid\n\nFull routine is wash with plexion prescription, TO Hyaluronic B5, face reality on top and then seal either Mara face oil.

However I recently moved somewhere that freezes and can admit that is not always possible anymore. I have an OLD blow dryer that I use when I do diffuse but since it's Black Friday I figured now would be a good time to get a quality one. Does anyone have any recommendations on a good blow dryer? I'm willing to pay a decent price if it's a quality blowdryer. The less frizz the better. I have 3A hair if that makes a difference!\n\n  \nIt's saying I need to add a routine:\n\nSunday is my wash day, only day I shampoo (Deva Curl No-poo). I shower almost every day because of my job and the gym. \n\nNormal shower routine: Get my hair wet, condition (Deva Curl one conditioner), comb my hair with a wide tooth comb, rinse sparingly. Finger comb leave in conditioner in (Donna's Recipe Sweet Potato Pie Leave In) and curl cream (Deva Curl curl cream). While my hair is still sopping wet I will wide tooth comb it one more time to make sure the product is evenly distributed. Then I will use a curl brush on my hair in sections (sometimes I'll just skip this step), flip head over and add gel (Deva Curl ultra defining gel), scrunch with old cotton tshirt, dont touch until its time to \"scrunch the crunch\".

      "content": "I am 24 f. My hair has always been on the finer side. I have hair that’s about halfway down my chest. My hair is naturally wavy/curly, though generally unpredictable as some strands are coily while others are wavy. Like I said my hair has always been fine. But lately idk… it feels finer than usual. If I braid my entire head, that one braid is as thick as my thumb. If I put my hair up, the ponytail has gaps in between and it looks like I have such little hair.\nFor background context: I had very curly hair as a child but it straightened over the years. When I was 21 I noticed it was curling in some areas so I switched to curly products and have been doing a curly routine since (curl shampoo and conditioner, mouse, gel, protective hair styles, sleeping in a bonnet, plopping, diffusing, etc.). However, I feel like since I started this curly routine, my hair has been getting thinner. I noticed this “opening” (as I call it) around the time I started plopping. I used to part my hair on this side and the part was getting a little strong, so I started combing my hair upside down and plopping so that my hair would dry more naturally and not in a fixed part. This is when I started noticing this on my scalp. \nAs for genetics- my mom has super thin and fine hair and has her whole life. My dad and brother has crazy thick hair. I’m aware that hair thickness is genetic. But damn isn’t there some product out there that might help?\nI suppose this post is asking two things - is this a cowlick/strong part or hair loss? And any tips or recommendations on helping thicken hair?",
