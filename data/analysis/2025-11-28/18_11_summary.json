      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

People who lack this protein cannot resolve inflammation anywhere in the body. It was initially being used as a treatment to speed up wound healing and it worked remarkably, leaving no identifiable scar tissue. Studies showed that in the healed areas, there was actually new hair follicles. The idea is that as an anti - inflammatory response it sends actually makes NEW follicles, a process known as Neogenesis. Now while the initial and published studies are done on mice, some studies were done on human tissues and actually showed similar results, with new hair follicles producing hairs and actively being in anagen. This protein also prolongs the anagen phase as it imcfeasss growth factors like EGF and VEGF and decreases TGFB-1. It also prevents apoptosis or cell death, which is usually what ends the anagen phase. Now while this is far away, the company actually released a cosmetic product that will be available December 15, but at the insane price of 15,000€ per liter I mean that’s insane. ",

      "content": "​Hi everyone,  \n​I’m looking for some advice because I’m feeling really stuck. I’ve attached photos of my skin from March 2025 (2nd pic) vs. Nov 2025. I have been seeing a dermatologist consistently (visits every 3 weeks), but honestly, my skin condition hasn't improved much. While the hyperpigmentation has faded slightly, the acne is persistent, and the texture on my chin hasn't budged. My skin and lips feel dry all the time and breakouts consistently worsen during my period.\n\n\nMy derm recommended me this routine:  \n* Cleanser: AHA/BHA Cleanser (6% Glycolic Acid + 2% Salicylic Acid)\n* ​Moisturizer: Moisturex Hydra\n* ​Sunscreen: Suncross\n* ​Actives Cycle:  \n​Week 1: Adapalene 0.1% &amp; Clindamycin 1% gel (continuous use)  \n​Week 2: No actives  \n​Week 3: Glycolic Acid Peel (35%)  \n​Repeat\n\n\nI drink plenty of water, change my pillowcases every other day, and maintain a relatively healthy diet.\n\n\nSince the acne isn't going away, I’m desperate to try some products I see hyped up, but I'm scared to make it worse. These are the products I wanna try:  \n* CeraVe hydrating cleanser in the AM only \n* Bioderma Atoderm Crème in the PM for heavier moisturization\n* The Ordinary Niacinamide serum 2x daily\n\n\nWould adding any of these products make any difference? Any advice or product recommendations would be amazing. Thank you!",

The only thing that I found to help and actually keep my lips moisturized for days after application was the Elf Lip Plumping lipgloss (pink sugar). I used it once a day for over two years until a few weeks ago when I started getting white heads by my lips. I had a horrible feeling it was from my lipgloss, so I stopped using it for a week and they went away. I tried it again recently and they came back almost immediately. \nNow I’m looking for something else to use but pure lanolin, and aquaphor have not helped. Chapstick, Vaseline, and EOS are also no goes and haven’t helped long term either. \nI stay hydrated and don’t typically lick or bite my lips. But with the winter coming on, I need something to help. \nAny recommendations would be highly appreciated!",

      "content": "Hi, posted on this subreddit earlier about patchy skin on the back of my palms. My skin was dry on my face but it's gotten really bad today. \n\nFor context: 20F, living super close to the equator (hence a very harsh, DRY winter), allergic rhinitis, suspected high IgE count (developed a grape allergy this year &amp; went into anaphylactic shock. I've been dealing with \"dry skin\" since the second week of November. In the past week, I've noticed rough skin on my hands (as mentioned earlier in a post), flaky skin on the extreme edges of my forehead (near my hairline) and the area near my sideburns is super sensitive. \n\nRoutine before the second week of november:\n- Neutrogena Oil Balancing Face Wash\n- Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum\n- Johnson's Face &amp; Body Cream (mildly fragranced, but I had really clear skin with it from Sep 2023 to Mar 2025. Hormonal/weight gain issues made my skin act up but I don't think it's ever caused major problems).\n- Bioré Sunscreen \n\nAfter I started noticing persistent dry skin, I switched to cleansing with lukewarm water and gently \"exfoliating\" with my hands to rid dry skin or any pilled moisturiser. I started using a 10% Urea Cream on my face. \n\nToday, I woke up and realised I had itched myself while asleep on one cheek and cried to my mother. I'm very vain, and I already have KP on my arms and acanthosis nigaricans on my neck/underarms and I feel very insecure. \n\nMid-october, I was really happy with myself because of how well the AA serum was working for me (I started using it at the beginning of the month to get dull hormonal acne scars on my chin). It ended up fading my dark circles too. This feels like a big fuck-you in response. \n\nCurrently, this is what I plan to do:\n\n- Shower (preferably in the morning) with lukewarm water and mild body wash (I'm planning to switch to Dove Soap because apparently it's a lot more kind to skin)\n- Moisturise (I have 2 moisturisers, CeraVe SA Rough &amp; Bumpy Skin + Swiss Image Shea Butter moisturiser). I usually only use CeraVe on my arms for KP. \n- Cleanse face with water, gentle exfoliation(?)\n- 10% Urea moisturiser for my face, followed by Vaseline. I plan to use Vaseline on my hands as well. \n\nNote: Financial issues and we don't have beneficial medical insurance &amp; healthcare is super expensive here. My sister is a Resident Doctor, ENT, but besides that I don't really have any means to obtain medical advice. \n",

      "content": "I am 24 f. My hair has always been on the finer side. I have hair that’s about halfway down my chest. My hair is naturally wavy/curly, though generally unpredictable as some strands are coily while others are wavy. Like I said my hair has always been fine. But lately idk… it feels finer than usual. If I braid my entire head, that one braid is as thick as my thumb. If I put my hair up, the ponytail has gaps in between and it looks like I have such little hair.\nFor background context: I had very curly hair as a child but it straightened over the years. When I was 21 I noticed it was curling in some areas so I switched to curly products and have been doing a curly routine since (curl shampoo and conditioner, mouse, gel, protective hair styles, sleeping in a bonnet, plopping, diffusing, etc.). However, I feel like since I started this curly routine, my hair has been getting thinner. I noticed this “opening” (as I call it) around the time I started plopping. I used to part my hair on this side and the part was getting a little strong, so I started combing my hair upside down and plopping so that my hair would dry more naturally and not in a fixed part. This is when I started noticing this on my scalp. \nAs for genetics- my mom has super thin and fine hair and has her whole life. My dad and brother has crazy thick hair. I’m aware that hair thickness is genetic. But damn isn’t there some product out there that might help?\nI suppose this post is asking two things - is this a cowlick/strong part or hair loss? And any tips or recommendations on helping thicken hair?",

It had been a year since I heat styled my hair, but yesterday I wanted to blow it out, so I did and I used a straightener to curl my ends a bit. \nBefore bed I grabbed the wrong hair oil (a soybean diluted tea tree oil vs my usual lightweight blend) and put it on my mids to ends. Today I woke up and some parts are a little greasy/ stringy. \nDisappointed bc I avoid heat on hair as much as possible and was looking forward to wearing the style for the rest of the week. \n\nMy question is whether it’d be too harmful to go ahead and do a quick cowash and then re-dry and straightener-curl ends.  \nWould it be better to dona fun hairstyle today and then re dry? or should I just not at all, maybe wait even more time til after my next full wash? \n\nI’ll include my pre heat styling routine bc I guess it’s more relevant:\nHair is fine, low porosity. \n1. redken acidic bonding treatment for at least 4 hours\n2. oil scalp and hair (different oils depending on needs), min 2 hrs \n3. in shower: mielle rosemary mint scalp scrub in sections\n4. shampoo in sections (i alternate between a few, ex. raw sugar grow pro) \n5. hair masque (pre heat styling i’ll usually do mielle 2 min deep conditioner kalahari melon and aloe and on my very very ends and bleached chunks, i’ll do manuka honey intensive hydration masque from shea moisture). \n6. Rinse, brush wet hair, then lay a bit of watered down leave in\n7. use tresemme hest protectant \n8. let it dry 80% \n9. revlon hair brush it in small sections, slow in medium heat just to get it dry and semi shaped\n10. 1-2 passes on small sections to get the flat iron curls \n11. finish off w a lightweight oil (ex gisou) \n\n(I use cold water in the shower, usually wash 1x a week) \n\n(photo was original results, I just wanted to make sure someone saw!)\nalso idk if it’s relevant but it’s raining cats and dogs today, so maybe waiting it out is still fruitful?

Followed by it's hydrating conditioner after rinsing it out and combing my hair throught. I use a leave in conditioner from bBlunt which I also comb through my hair. and finally I use a gel on my soaking dripping wet hair. \n\n  \nI dry my hair using a diffuser (Although I would very like NOT to).
