      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

(An hr or so after gettin home)\n\n• Azelaic acid (Aziderm 10percent) - Bcs i’m a girl and eventually get a pimple or two😔 so so so,this product really really helps with scarsss!! (Alternate day with tret)\n\n• Snail Mucin (cosrx) - I need ample hydration in winters so this helps with it (usage - am n pm) \n\n• Sunscreen (derma co n foxtale) - spf 50+ sunscreen bcs all the products i use require sunscreen and also u anyway have to use it if you get tanned easily (everyday,am n afternoon/anytime before goin out in sun) \n\n• Hydrating agent (Boroplus)- tret is infamous for causing dryness,i highly recommend sandwich method while applying tret and i use Boroplus (whose hydration imo is unmatched)\n\n• With Rogan Badam Shrieen , i do a monthly massage which keeps the skin plump and supple, u can do the same with coconut oil too\n\n• Snail peptide under eye cream - since initially i didnt use tret on under eye area,i used to use this to keep the under eye,fine line free (on the day of azelaic acid)\n\n• Vaseline Lip therapy (rose tinted) since ive very very very dry lips,this has been the Holy grail for my lips  (everytime i feel dry lips+right before bed)\n\n• Rice toner (the face shop)-didnt think it helped really,so not anymore. \n\nThis has been a journey of 4months + ive combination skin (highly influenced by seasons )\n\nHappy to answer more Qs in comments and incase u made it till the last🧃!

As a result it feels like it weighs my hair down and it definitely gets oily faster.\n\nI'm not that well-versed in haircare but I sometimes use the Pantene keratin hair mask, which I also feel like it leaves a residue behind no matter how well I rinse after I let it stay. \n\nEven before the psoriasis diagnosis, my hair was kinda dry but also got oily very quickly which led me to washing it every other day or even everyday, depending on my schedule. I know that probably dries it out even more but I honestly can't go out with hair looking nearly damp and sweaty from all the oil 🥲 It's also pretty stiff(?), as in it stays where I comb it. If I comb my part on the right after a shower then I won't be able to change the part to the left unless I wash my hair again. \n\nI've considered just shaving it all and letting it heal on its own but before I make such a drastic change, I thought I'd ask you guys, in case someone has any helpful advice to give me.

Accutane is the only thing to curb it through micro-dosing, I took a calculated risk with my derm to add in topicals to address skin tone, scarring, PIH etc and it has paid off.\n\n[I posted this last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/1gudegp/before_and_after_results_experience_from_15_years/), I thought an update 1 year along might be useful for some people if they're interested. I originally posted this to r/accutane.\n\n# Photos\n\n[Older pics before any accutane are in my first post and can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/1gudegp/before_and_after_results_experience_from_15_years/). New pics start from 1 year ago to present day. A few are directly comparable, most are day to day 'honest' photos instead of curating the best ones. No filters or airbrushing, one pic does have colour grading, I included one close up pic (last few days), only one is from waking with no skincare (within the last week).\n\n&gt;Marks on my nose are from my glasses, this happened years before accutane. My frames and lenses are just heavy.\n\n# Stats, Diet and Bloods\n\n* 5'7, 165lb\\~ (up to 185 occasionally)\n* No idea on cumulative dose\n* Current dose: 20mg x3 per week in the AM with food\n* Bloods: every 6 months, historically normal on conventional and micro dosing.\n* Diet: \\~80/20 healthy/unhealthy.\n* Dairy daily for a few cups of tea, 20-50g of cheese if I eat it, 70g of whey concentrate most days.\n* 4-6L water daily, rarely sugary drinks, zero cal preferred.\n* No ethanol, stopped \\~4 yrs ago.\n* I wear monthly contact lenses \\~70% of the time.\n\n# Side Effects\n\n&gt;Arbitrary metric: 0 = Sahara Desert, 10 = fully hydrated\n\n\\- Dry skin: way better than conventional dosing. I'm at a 9/10 consistently, I moisturise my entire body after showering when slightly damp. Scalp is at a 8/10 due to recent cold weather but it's well managed.\n\n\\- Dry lips: 9/10 consistently, if I forget my tin of Vaseline aloe it is noticeable, 6/10 in the rare event.\n\n\\- Night Vision: on conventional dosing I had reduced depth perception of dark objects, now it's near normal. Historically and currently this had no impact on night driving. Optometrist has noted perfectly normal eye health also.\n\n\\- Muscle &amp; joint aches: Zero. This is entirely reduced compared to conventional dosing.\n\nI haven't experienced any brain fog, fatigue, GI issues, sexual  dysfunction, IIH, reduced mental health, dry eyes, skin rashes, nosebleeds or other symptoms with micro dosing.\n\n# New Skincare\n\n&gt;**I've attached pictures of the pertinent topicals I use next to a measuring tape to give an idea of the amount**\n\n\\- Menarini Tretinoin 0.025% gel (previous): I scaled from x3 to x7 per week quite quickly with no irritation or purging, this was huge for scarring and PIH as accutane isn't great for it. My skin didn't mind tret cream or gel personally. \n\n\\- Tazret Tazarotene 0.1% cream: switched months ago, no irritation or purge, I believe my skin responds better to this than tretinoin but not by a huge amount. Cream formulation doesn't give me any CCs and applies nicely, does need to be dotted around the face though. \n\n\\- Finacea 15% Azelaic Acid: scaled from x3 to x7 per week with no irritation or purging. I increased PM applications up to x7 fairly quick, so x14 per week total with a staggered amount (less in PM). I think this has been a massive game changer for getting rid of any PIH and general skin tone evenness. I much prefer this to Skinoren as the consistency feels a bit less claggy.\n\n\\- Tosowoong Arbutin 7% + Tranexamic Acid 4% Cream\\*:\\* low potency and pretty slow benefits but this pushes things a little bit further. A tube lasts quite a while, consistency is slightly thicker than a serum. \n\n\\- Medik8 Liquid Peptides: maybe the peptides are doing their thing, maybe they're not, I think they're a long term game. The hyaluronic acid is great for my skin though, quite expensive for what it is however it's lasted me months. \n\n\\- Simple Ceramide &amp; Omega Complex Serum: oddly no actual ceramides but \"boosts\" production, it's cheap and keeps my skin lump. Love it, no idea on exact times but a bottle has lasted me months, not much product is needed at all. \n\n\\- Beauty of Joseon Aqua Relief SPF50: new holy grail SPF. Feels moisturising especially now it's colder, consistency is excellent and zero white/blue/purple cast. Only grip is only 50mL tubes and no &gt;50mL's like Biore. \n\n\\- E45 Body Lotion: inexpensive and hydrating. No other complaints. 4 pumps for legs, 2 torso and neck, 3 back, 2 arms, 1 booty. Again annoying it doesn't come in 1000g bottles. This dries down quickly so you don't need to wait massively before getting dressed. \n\n\\- QV Moisturising Cream: holy grail moisturiser, on the thicker side and does contain petrolatum and liquid paraffin so may not be suitable for all. Comes in 100g, 500g and 1050g pumps. 500 and 1050gs have 0% waste as the inside of the container is a cone shape so all product drains. Did try it as a body moisturiser but it didn't feel great having to wait longer for dressing compared to others, marginal difference. Same pump amounts for body as above (also same for CeraVe).\n\n# Full Routine:\n\n**AM:**\n\n\\- CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser OR La Roche Posay Toleriane\n\n\\- Medik8 Liquid Peptides on damp skin\n\n\\- Simple Ceramide Serum on slightly damp skin\n\n\\- Tosowoong TXA &amp; Arb\n\n\\- Finacea 15%, approx pea size amount\n\n\\- QV moisturising cream - full pump\n\n\\- BoJ AR SPF\n\n**PM:**\n\n\\- CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser OR La Roche Posay Toleriane\n\n\\- Medik8 Liquid Peptides on damp skin\n\n\\- Simple Ceramide Serum on slightly damp\n\n\\- Tazarotene 0.1%, approx pea size\n\n\\- Finacea 15%, smaller amount\n\n\\- QV moisturising cream - full pump\n\nNo idea on total cost.\n\n**Other products used/Mini Reviews:**\n\n**-** LRP Toleriane Cleanser: this is pretty gentle and non-offensive, likely so much so it won't remove SPFs if you use heavier ones, could be wrong though. Consistency is buttery smooth, personally I don't need much. \n\n\\- CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser: kind of feels like rubbing moisturiser and water on your face but my skin prefers this to LRP, it feels more gentle than LRP Toleriane for me. Comes in 1000g pumps which have lasted over a year so quite ideal. A friend of mine was leaving this on their face for some reason (idk why) and said they felt their skin felt softer... maybe that's something to explore, maybe not. \n\n**-** CeraVe Moisturising Lotion: I quite like this for face and body but switched due to price. Doesn't take long to dry down so no latency between getting dressed, no greasiness either. It's on the lighter side for a moisturser.\n\n\\- Biore Watery Essence SPF50: was my previous face SPF, now it's only used for topping up if needed. Still excellent, zero cast. You want to buy the Japanese versions though as the rest of the worlds seem to be straight ass.. alcohol smelling, greasy, basically standard Western generic SPF\n\n\\- Nivea Sun Protect SPF50: for arms, legs, stomach chest etc if exposed. A bit greasy, does contain fragrance but it's inexpensive. Personally my skin does not mind this at all.\n\n\\- Sanex Expert Skin Health shower gel. I've used pretty much all of Sanex's line and I'm ok with all of them. Luckily you can buy huge pump bottles. Some do have more or less amounts of exfoliating acids and fragrance though.\n\n\\- Hand creams: Aveeno Daily Moisturising Body Lotion, Nivea Soft Moisturising Cream and decants of CeraVe moisturising lotion. Whatever is available on me is what I use, my hands aren't picky.\n\n\\- Simple Micellar Water: only used for heavy SPF days with re-applying, applied with hands and then followed up with my usual cleansers. No complaints, it's also cheap.\n\n\\- Super Facialist Salicylic Acid Smooth &amp; Clarify Exfoliating Toner: mix of salicylic, mandelic and glycolic acid at low %'s. I dab a tiny amount along my beard and hairline after cutting my hair to degunk and reduce any ingrowns.\n\n# Hair &amp; Scalp\n\nMy dandruff is from cold weather and hard water, no cause from fungus or skin conditions.\n\nI wash my hair 2 or 3 times a week, mainly I use Aveeno Hydrating Oat Milk Shampoo (Neutrogena T/gel sometimes) and then follow up with Aveeno Hydrating Oat Milk Conditioner.\n\nPost-wash: 5 drops Jojoba oil --&gt; Shea Moisture Leave in Conditioner --&gt; brush --&gt; durag\n\nNon-wash days: As I Am Castor Oil Water --&gt; Jojoba --&gt; brush --&gt; durag.\n\nBeard get's the same but no Shea Moisture or As I Am, it's Moss Bros Beard Butter.\n\n# Risks I've Taken: Surgery\n\nThere's some evidence observing accutane interfering with healing risk of scarring. My derm and I did an evidence dive and concluded it was half baked, old and overly cautious for my situation, it's also been challeneged in contemporary research That's not to say it doesn't have an effect, however.\n\nCommon practice is to avoid any procedure for 6 months afterward, in spite of that I took the risk to have plastic surgery while micro-dosing. The surgeon initially said wait 6 months, I discussed it further and he was ok with it. My scars from this are not any different to how I'd normally scar. Of course that can't apply to everyone necessarily.\n\nIf I did want any procedures targetted (I don't at all) for scarring or body art, I still wouldn't get them while micro-dosing. Purely due to the location of where they'd be and having to deal with that, not necessarily the risk ratio or likelihood.\n\n# Things That I've Tried Which Didn't Work\n\n**-** Geek &amp; Gorgeous Power Peptides. Skin disagreed, this just gave me closed comedones. Nice consistency and dried down quick. The pipette is angled unlike many which allows you to get every drop, bottle can be sterilised and re-used too. \n\n\\- Any kind of Muslin cloth, cotton pad or face sponge. These just irritate my skin compared to using my hands.\n\n\\- Boderm and Aziderm azelaic acid. Products themselves aren't bad but formulation feels grainy and not great to apply.\n\n\\- Vitamin C, L-Ascorbic Acid. Tried Geek &amp; Gorgeous and CeraVe 10% Renewing, even with liberal use both of these made my face sting in places but didn't irritate any further. Not too surprising in context of my routine. No longer trialling these. \n\n\\- Vitamin C derivative, ascorbyl glucoside. Tried The Orindary's formulation and it was completely fine to apply, I just didn't like the consistency so shelved it. I'd be open to another ascorbyl product in the future.\n\n\\- Vaseline slugging. Had great success for months and months, it then started causing closed comedones. Switched to CeraVe Healing Ointment but to no avail. Entirely removed and skin returned to normal very quickly.\n\n\\- Plucking facial and nose hairs. Awful idea, caused ingrowns and little spots of hypopigmentation. I now leave my facial hairs alone and nose get's a rotating electric trimmer instead.\n\n\\- Anything with centella. Tried SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule and Purito Unscented Serum, no bueno, they just gave me closed comedones. \n\n# Lessons &amp; Going Forward\n\n* It's highly likely you notice your skin more than other people will. Everyone has texture, uneven tone, bumps, lumps, it's all normal.\n* If you scar easily, prevention &gt; management.\n* Consistency &gt; intensity. Even if it's not sunny or the UV index is low I'm still applying SPF simply to keep a routine\n* Starting off slowly &gt; starting off at 100mph. Adding in products slowly and one by one lets you know which product is causing effects or irritation, otherwise it gets muddy. Same applies with increasing their frequency.\n* For me, micro-dosing side effects don't scale linearly like my conventional dosing, it's not like a mini version. It's a night and day difference and the low side effects make it far more bearable, they're a non-issue for me really.\n* I'm not a dermatologist (allied health) but being able to read, interpret and critically appraise studies has helped massively in removing guess work or relying on questionable or potentially bad advice. My basic thought process: *Upsides? Downsides? What's likely to happen? If it did, how easy is it to ameliorate?* Eg, a new moisturiser is low consequence and risk, while getting an ablative beam of light while micro-dosing might not be very easily reversible even if the risks are low.\n\nThat's pretty much it",

      "content": "Currently on vacation in Puerto Vallarta. Two days ago, I was in the pool on a floatie for a good few hours. I noticed mildly burnt my chest and my stomach - despite applying high spf sunscreen. The following day, I wore a one piece bathing suit all day to keep the areas covered. Upon waking up this morning, I noticed my chest redness had faded substantially but patches around my stomach are now raised and tender (pictured). It almost feel like a burn you get from a curling iron or touching a hot pan. My boyfriend thought maybe spilleda drink with lots of lime on myself while in the floatie and accidentally gave myself a citrus burn... but it's hard to know for sure. Not sure if should seek medical attention. \n\nGenerally, feel ok, but I'm also on day 6 of an all inclusive vacation so obviously a little run down. lve never had anything like this happen so I'm a little concerned. It's not super itchy per se, but it's def tender to touch. What should do? Keep it dry? Keep it lubed up with aloe? Or should just bite th bullet and call in a doctor? Any help (or maybe reassurance!) would be so appreciated.",
