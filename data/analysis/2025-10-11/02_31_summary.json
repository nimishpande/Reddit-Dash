      "content": "I see a lot of people talk about hair porosity like it’s the same from root to tip but I don’t think many really understand how it actually works. (*Depending on hair type*) the hair near the scalp is usually lower porosity because it’s newer and healthier, while the mid lengths and ends naturally get more porous over time from everyday wear, washing(esp frequent washes), brushing, the sun, heat damage, dying/bleaching hair, friction or just the ends being older. It is possible for hair from root to tip to be fully low porosity but for that to happen the hair would have to go through little to no damage in its lifetime of growing, for many people it’s inevitable that the porosity will change. \n\nWhen I only used lightweight, silicone-free products for my “low porosity” hair, my hair was a MESS, very damaged, and lots of breakage. My ends stayed dry and frizzy constantly, but once I started using heavier conditioners, masks, and leave ins especially with silicones, my hair completely changed for the better. Tbh once I stopped stressing about porosity and just focused on what my hair actually needed (oily scalp dry ends) is when my hair as a whole improved! \n\n*If anyone has also struggled with this too i can give some product recommendations in the comments on what’s worked for me!! lmk!*\n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

The problem is that my hair is getting damaged from doing this every day. \n\nUsing a blow dryer and brush would be better for my hair; however, even with a 1-inch brush, I hate how it doesn't give that flick of a curve at the end, and the volume is too much. I don't like that bubble high volume kind of bang, I only want it to be slightly volumed with a distinct flick at the end-- very 60s vibes. I also feel like when I blow dry my bangs it looks wispier, lighter, and more see through-- whereas when I iron it, the bang looks thicker-- the way I want it to be.   \n\n\nAny advice please?

I was in utter shock the entire time I styled with the bounce curl brush at how well it worked.\n\nI don’t have much CG products yet - ordered a few things but they are in transit. Here is the routine I used prior to this photo:\n\n1. Wash and condition with AG Haircare ACV Balance shampoo &amp;  conditioner - squish to condish \n\n2. Rinse, scrunch while wet and wrap with microfiber towel\n\n3. Section hair and brush with bounce curl brush to create curl clumps. I scrunched immediately after each section with Giovanni LA hold styling gel.\n\n4. Blow dry mostly upside down with Dyson Supersonic &amp; diffuser attachment\n\n5. Let it completely air dry then scrunch out the crunch with a tiny bit of jojoba oil\n\n6. Stare at hair in mirror completely shocked",

      "content": "I’m a 23-year-old guy, and I’ve had acne since I was about 17. It’s gone through phases, sometimes barely noticeable, sometimes really bad. Earlier this year, it flared up worse than ever, and I got desperate to find a solution.\n\nAfter a lot of trial and error, I think I’ve finally figured out what was driving most of my breakouts: **too much Omega-6**. For years I ate huge amounts of peanut butter every day, along with almond milk and almond yogurt. I used to believe dairy and sugar were the main culprits behind my acne, but even after cutting them, I was still getting painful cystic breakouts. I still do not eat any dairy and very little sugar. I have been off dairy for 3 years.\n\nThen I learned about how **peanuts are extremely high in Omega-6**, with an Omega-6:3 ratio around **4000:1,** compared to a healthy balance closer to **4:1**. Excess Omega-6 can be highly inflammatory, and inflammation is closely tied to acne.\n\nOnce I cut out peanuts and other high-Omega-6 foods, my cystic acne disappeared. I still get the occasional small whitehead, but nothing like before. At the same time, I started eating a lot of **overnight oats made with coconut milk, chia seeds, and flax seeds,** both great sources of Omega-3s. I truly think that balance has made all the difference.\n\nI know not everyone believes diet affects acne, but I really believe it has at least some effect for everyone.\n\n**TL;DR:** Try lowering your Omega-6 intake (especially from peanuts, other nuts, etc) and increasing your Omega-3s (from chia, flax, or fish). It might really help your skin. Just wanted to leave this here, even if it only helps 1 person somewhere.",

I probably am wrong on that but I want your help with this Basically should I moisturize after using Stridex, if so what Moisturizer should I use ( and is the sun screen I listed fine? Never really tried it seems to be recommended thought ) and should I have another treatment for my acne along with the Stridex, and should I be applying my Stridex right after using my Vicky face wash?\n",
