I always had curly hair but grew up in southern Oklahoma and they’re definitely not training boys on their curly hair. This sub came in clutch in helping me explore what works best for my hair. \n\nAnywho, here’s where I am seven years later, before and after. :) \n\nWearing a bonnet to sleep was the most impactful routine change I made. It took awhile to adjust to it; I had to try different ones until it worked right. But eventually it worked. \n\nI cowash about once a week. Always diffuse. Aunt Jackie’s product has been the most consistent product for me to use. I started with their leave in conditioner and slowly bought their mouse and gel. It’s worked perfect for my hair. I use a clarifying shampoo about once a month or less. Post clarifying shampoo, I do a longer hair mask. \n\nAnywho, anyone doubting their hair; KEEP AT IT AND TRUST THE PROCESS! Seriously. Trust the process and just know you’re going to go through a lot of different trial and error. But the more you do it, the more you’ll fall in love with yourself. Anywho, first pic is about 7 years ago and last pic is today. \n\n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Rinse, scrunch while wet and wrap with microfiber towel\n\n3. Section hair and brush with bounce curl brush to create curl clumps. I scrunched immediately after each section with Giovanni LA hold styling gel.\n\n4. Blow dry mostly upside down with Dyson Supersonic &amp; diffuser attachment\n\n5.

      "title": "My little skincare and haircare routine 🩰✨🫧",
      "content": "🦋\nAbout me 🎀: My skintype is combination(oily on large areas and dry on another). I have large open pores and pigmentation. I easily get whiteheads and redheads if i don’t wash my face to reduce the oilyness. I have PCOS ⚡️and i go to gym like 2 days average in a week. I eat a lot of sugars, reduced carbs and take whey protein. I have facial hairs due to PCOS so i use  facial hair trimmer twice a week.\n\nAbout the products🦩:\n\nFacial Skincare🫧: \n1. Paknet (derma suggested)🪼: skin feels cleared and very smooth. I did a little research and got to know benzoyl peroxide reduces pimple causing bacteria. So i guess it helps reduce pimple. I gently move my hands in circular motion clockwise and upwards to let me skin absorb it and then wash. (AM PM)\n\n2. Acne oc- moisturiser (derma suggested)🪻: reduces pores and moisturise my face. Regulates oil production on face. I have seen some change in my pores and oiliness. I again apply it and move my hands upwards to let it soak in.(AM PM)\n\n3. Adapalene (derma suggested)🦥: it has benzoyl peroxide so it helps reduce pimple causing bacteria and in turn help prevent pimples. I take a very little of it and again in circular motion upwards apply it all over the skin but not on sides of nose, under/close to the eye and in sides of my mouth. Once in two days. Can irritate skin if over used.(AM -use sunscreen after)\n\n3. Moisurex-hydra (prev derma suggested) 🐚: i apply it same way , circular clockwise upwards till absorbs. Its water based so good if you have dry skin.  (AM PM)\n\n4. a. Aziderm (prev derma suggested)🐝: it reduces pigmentation, pimple and pimple marks. Also helps in detaning. My new derma hasn’t suggested it, but it works well so i’m using it. Same application - upwards and in circular motion. I use it as night as you need to save your skin from sun after these products. Use it a little like adapalene as it can irritate skin as well (PM)\n\n4. b. Clindamycin (derma suggested)🐥: no idea what it does but i have to apply it everyday in the morning. Doesnt irritate. Same application - circular, upwads) (AM PM)\n\n5. Deconstruct vitamin c serum ( self suggested) 🪽- my skin has got tanned so started using it recently. Still waiting to see if it works. Read application on the bottle(AM PM with sunscreen)\n\n5 b. Pixi toner -(nykaa gift) 👾- its good, no idea what it does but doesn’t do any harm so yeah, good so far. I apply it with cotton in circular upwards motion. (AM PM)\n\n6. Sunscreens 🌞-( all doc suggested current and prev) - uv doux is best but is tinted. It feels heavy so i will get the non silicone based on from uv doux. Others are fine. (Every two hours under sun, 2x pinky finger size)\n\n7. Vaseline (self suggested) 👄- i have pigmented lips, used it daily whenever i felt my lips have gotten dry, started observing them getting pink and less dark.\n\n8. Meds ( derma suggested) 💊- green one is omega - good for hair and skin. Black one is antioxidant, and peach one is for pimple reduction. I take them everyday\n\n9.shatavari juice (self suggested)🍶- i have pcos, so i take it every day after meal at night, helps with pcos and inflammation i guess. Im using everything so dont know how exactly is this working. I have to drink it for another month or so.\n\n10. Medicube collagen night mask, vlcc detan mask, detan scrub (self suggested)🎭- once a week for tanning.\n\n11. Turmeric and red sandal (self suggested)🎭- got them recently, good for face, clears , depigments brightens. I use it twice a week, it leaves yellowish color, so use it at night.\n\nHaircare:\n1. Ordinary 👩‍🦰: (self suggested): reduces hairfall and dandruff. Works like magic. I have seen hair fall reduction and new baby hairs (PM )\n\n2. Serum (self suggested) 🪮- makes hairs manageable inturn less breakage. After wash or whenever im using heat.\n\n3.  Soul flower serum (self suggested) 🫤- unsure, but i would bot recomment too many stuff ordinary is best.\n\n4. Soulflower oils 🛢️- (self suggested) - best ones for hair growth and thickness. (An hour before hairwash)\n\n\nAll these products are what i use, not suggesting that they work like magic or will work for everyone, but my face is now pimple free and when i touch my skin now, smooth and soft🥰. With PCOS your skin, mood and everything becomes twice complicated😅, i’ll aways suggest doctors when you think skincare and health🔎. If you are in bangalore and looking for the doctor, i have some names. I’m can help you🙃.\n\n\nThanks and have a great skin and hair ♥️🌸\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It didn’t turn out how I expected — it looked quite dark in the salon, but I thought that after a few washes the toner would fade and it would look better.\nAfter washing my hair a few times and the toner faded, I noticed an orange patch in the middle of my hair. I told her about it, but she said it was my fault, that I didn’t take care of my hair properly, and that there’s nothing she can do except tone it again. She said she will not cover the repair of my hait and I’d only have to pay for the products.\nIn the meantime, through a mutual acquaintance, I found out she spoke quite badly about me, so I didn’t feel comfortable going back to her (plus, what she suggested wouldn’t have been a long-term solution anyway — just another waste of money, since the first toner only lasted 2–3 washes).\n\nAnyway… the thing is, right now I can’t really afford a color correction, and I don’t think my hair could handle another bleaching session either. I tried using a Londa Londaplex toner, but it barely did anything.\n\nDo you have any advice? I was thinking of toning it myself at home with a toner mixed with a 1.9% developer (I honestly have no idea, I just saw it on TikTok 😅), but I’m not sure if it would come out even, since my hair has two different tones.\nThank you so much for any tips! 💛\n",

Honestly if I could cover my face 24/7 like a mummy, i would.\n\nI'm looking for recommendation on sunscreen for face, sunscreen body lotion for body, 1(or can be 2) serums, any detan masks, scrubs if possible.",
