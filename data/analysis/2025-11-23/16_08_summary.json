      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Some products have heat protectant claims \"up to X degree\" on their label, while other products with the same silicones do not. Could I just use the product without those claims on the label? Is it just marketing? Are there silicones that are better heat protectants than others?",

      "title": "Please help. I hate my hair. Any advice how I address this with the salon?",
      "content": "I’m hoping for some help. \n\nI’ve been to this salon twice. Had my hair cut there, loved it. My hair was balayaged at a different salon, they couldn’t fit me in for an appointment so I went back to this place. I’ve been to so many stylists over 15 years and have never complained *once*. I’ve always gotten what I asked or super close to. I have no idea how to address it and never want to hurt anyone’s feelings, so I was too nervous to complain.\n\nI came home crying. When I was leaving I told her I thought it looked great, because I didn’t want an awkward situation in front of her coworkers and I generally am just a people pleaser (so huge lesson on my part I know).\n\nSo I came in with a grown out balayage by about 4 months.  Blonde, bright ends. I booked a “mini” because it said “Starting at $220.00 - a  refresh to lighten face framing &amp; hair part. Includes toner, wash and style”. My hair goal was her to blend the grown out part up top and make a really bright face frame. I was alright with some dimension on the ends but wanted to keep them mostly blonde. Showed her a couple reference photos and emphasized how I mostly wanted a really bright face frame, bold, thicker. She said she would root the face frame a little bit,  I agreed with that as I didn’t want it to look harsh and unnatural, but still bright and bold. She agreed, said she would brighten up the front, and foil the top, but this would be considered a “partial”. She gave me a quote of $455 but said she “over estimated” product cost. She only used 2.5 bowls of bleach. When I had the last full balayage I loved that took around 5 hours last time, including a cut, I paid $330 (at a way fancier, bigger salon) so this had seemed SO steep. I understand every salon prices different. But I thought maybe it’s more because she’s lightening the ends more. Idk? Admittedly this is where I messed up - because the price point felt wild and doubled on me, but saying “that‘s way too much” or dispute the price with everyone around made me embarrassed and uncomfortable.  I also **genuinely kept thinking if I left with my dream hair I could justify it, so I trusted her.**\n\nThe stylist didn’t talk to me at all after that.  I don’t mind a silent appointment either. This is probably irrelevant lol because everyone has their days but made me more nervous to speak up I think. Anyways lol.\n\nWhen she pulled out the foils it still looked bright even wet… so I think she messed up the toner? I didn’t have the heart to tell her especially with her coworkers around that this wasn’t at all what I wanted. When she blowdried my bangs out first, the front of my hairline is SO dark. darker than my natural. She said something to the effect of “your bangs have some brown in them so it’s more seamless” … confusing because I had mentioned I didn’t want any darkness around my hairline. I wanted it to pop.\n\nit just looks so dark. My hairline is even darker when I pull it back. Maybe it’s an easy fix and they just brighten that part. I don’t know. Sure I guess it’s blended..  it’s just *so* off from my reference photos.\n\nWhen I got home and really looked at it, I’m feeling devastated. It’s nothing like what I showed. I keep wondering if I communicated wrong or something but the pictures I referenced also spoke for themselves. And my stylists always understood me before? The price was insane but it’s not even that I want a refund. Truly. I don’t want them to think I want free hair. I just want hair I like. I could really use some help on how to even word this. I’m not comfortable having the same girl do my hair again.  I don’t want her in trouble, either.  I feel like because I said I liked it when I left that they might insinuate me of lying or something. When really I just felt nervous and too awkward to say anything with everyone around (I know I have to work on that).\n\nSorry this was annoyingly long I just need advice on how to say this kindly and clearly.",

I’ve unfortunately never had anyone in my life to be able to show me what to do with curly hair, let alone my own. Now I know people say “oh just watch YouTube!” But I’ve tried and I never feel like I’m doing it right, and I give up (I know I shouldn’t). \n\nI’ve thought about trying another curly hair salon/cut but the prices are insane and I just quite simply can’t afford it, especially considering the last time someone told me they knew how to cut curly hair, I ended up with a “jellyfish cut” according to the next hair dresser who saw my hair. \n\nBut anyways here’s the info about my hair:\n\nWhen it first starts drying, it immediately is super frizzy and is in very loose very thin curls which I’m not too keen on. (not the type of curl youll see in the last photos, those are cute, but they only happen towards my scalp at the bottom of my head).\n\nIf I let my hair dry, and then brush it, obviously it is a massive frizzy mess, but once settled the bottom of my hair will curl, but that’s it and the top layer of my hair is ALWAYS so frizzy and has no curls no matter what I do, even when I just let it air dry without brushing, or even scrunching, and I HATE it!\n\nFor my routine: I’m currently using the “Kirsten ess the one” signature shampoo and conditioner however I feel like my hair is so dry and almost sticky after using it (sticky might not be the right word), but it’s like there’s left over stuff in my hair no matter how much I rinse it. After that I use a renewing argon oil of Morocco oil, and I use this almost daily too on my lengths and ends if needed. I have silk pillowcases, but no bonnet or anything since I see no point if my hair is just straight and frizzy \n\nPhotos attached:\nThe photos where I have blonde hair are from a couple years ago, and I’ve never seen my hair like this again since, I truly have NO idea what I did to get my hair like this, but I know I did something.. but I absolutely love how my hair looks curl wise and I wish I could replicate it.\n\nThe other photos is what my hair is like now/pretty much all of the time.\n\nIf anyone has any tips or advice, I’d love to know. I don’t know what my curl pattern is or anything so I feel pretty lost. I’m the only one in my family with curly hair and unfortunately don’t have any curly haired friends. \n",

      "content": "\n\nHi everyone, I really need some quick recommendations because I have to place my orders in the next two days and I’m completely overwhelmed.\n\nA bit of background so you understand my situation: I’m an Indian tan–brown skin girly, and due to personal struggles I stopped using makeup and even basic skincare for over a year. I’m finally getting back into it and basically restarting from zero. I want to rebuild a simple but effective makeup, skincare, and haircare routine, and a friend coming from the US has offered to bring things for me.\n\nI’ll mainly be shopping from NYX, LA Girl, Wet n Wild, and other drugstore brands, but I’m also placing a few orders on Ulta and other US websites if the products are worth it. My budget is around 20 USD per product, but I can stretch a little for something genuinely good.\n\nI would be incredibly grateful for recommendations for:\n• Blushes (cream or powder) that work well on tan/brown skin  \n• Lipsticks or lip products that flatter deeper tones  \n• Face products: concealers, foundations, tinted moisturizers, primers  \n• Drugstore must-haves from NYX, LA Girl, Wet n Wild, etc.  \n• Ulta exclusives or US-only products worth picking up  \n• Skincare or haircare items that are worth bringing from the US  \n\nHaircare part:  \nI recently got the Dyson Airwrap ID because my hair has suffered heat damage. I have shoulder-length hair and I’m learning how to use the attachments properly. The same friend coming from the US has agreed to bring extra attachments for me.\n\nI’m looking for:\n• Third-party Dyson Airwrap attachments (like AirStrap, round brush dupes, curl barrels) that you have personally tried, that fit well, and don’t damage the Dyson  \n• Trusted brands that ship online or are available in the US  \n• Any sales on official Dyson attachments on Dyson, Ulta, Sephora, or Best Buy  \n• Hairstyling products (heat protectants, volume sprays, hold sprays) that work well with the Airwrap, especially for short shoulder-length hair  \n\nSince I’m rebuilding everything from scratch and the order is urgent, I’d truly appreciate any advice, reviews, or product suggestions. Thank you so much to anyone who takes the time to help me.\n",

Easy to blend. Might pill if you layer too many products or use a thick/matte moisturizer underneath it. I skip moisturizer when I use it.\n\nWhite Cast : Low to None\n\nFragrance : None\n\nBest Suited for : All skin types except for oily. I have combination acne-prone skin and it did not break me out.\n\nSweat proof : No (Check out the unwind version)\n\nEye sensitivity : No stinging\n\nPrice : 599 but you can get it under 300 for 50 grams\n\nProtection : 7/10, gives decent protection. Better than a lot of gimmicky sunscreens, but there are better ones out there. \n\nReapplication : Easy to re-apply but definitely feels heavy.\n\nMy experience: \n\nI mainly use it for indoors for two reasons :\n\n1. It works like moisturiser + sunscreen in one. I skip moisturizer as it is quite moisturising.\n\n2. Two fingers’ worth feels heavy on me, and makes me sweat and makes my face look a little dull. So for indoors I apply less amount and it works fine.\n\n\nBeen using it for about a year now. Earlier this was the only sunscreen I used, but I did notice slight tanning with outdoor sun exposure (even with 2 fingers worth). My only real issue is that it feels more like a moisturizer with an SPF, which works on most days but once you get tanned it’s hard to reverse, especially with the UV index in summers. For indoor, it does the job.\n\nVerdict : Would repurchase for indoor use only.",

They cut my hair dry first, then styled my hair and then cut these face framing pieces. \n\nI just washed my hair for the first time since… and the face framing pieces have DISAPPEARED. Because they cut it while the hair was in these clumps, the face framing pieces were kind of specific to the way my hair was styled at the time… but now that I’ve washed it, the shorter pieces have clumped with longer pieces and it’s all generally the same length. \n\nI don’t know what to do, especially since I have my senior graduation pictures coming up soon, and I kind of care that they turn out nice. Do I figure out how to separate the short hairs and re-clump them? Do I try to learn how to cut my own hair? But then, I have no clue where to start. Would anyone be able to recommend where to start?\n\nFor my routine, I use matrix’s a curl can dream: their shampoo and conditioner, then i put in detangler, gel, and I diffuse.",
