      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

My face has always been red and painful for so much of my life, and I used to try and get around it by just putting more makeup on. This of course only made it even worse especially as I started hitting puberty. Eventually I decided to get into skincare and learned about different serums, and experimented around. \n\nBefore this all I thought I had to do was wash my face with more soap and water and eventually my acne would go away haha. I ended up finding the main triggers in my diet (mostly dairy and sugar) which made my face all inflamed and red. Also, I started moisturizing, using azelaic acid to clear the hyperpigmented spots and retinoids for the large acne patches. Hopefully that helps any of you guys in a similar position. \n\nmy routine: \n\nAM:\n\n\\- azelaic acid\n\n\\- tretinoin spot treatment\n\n\n\nPM \n\n\\- CeraVe moisturizer with aloe\n\n\\- tretinoin\n\n\n\nHonestly i'm just so glad that i'm done and can finally enjoy life without being hyperconscious about my face! okey thats my schpeil bye ;)",

Easy to blend. Might pill if you layer too many products or use a thick/matte moisturizer underneath it. I skip moisturizer when I use it.\n\nWhite Cast : Low to None\n\nFragrance : None\n\nBest Suited for : All skin types except for oily. I have combination acne-prone skin and it did not break me out.\n\nSweat proof : No (Check out the unwind version)\n\nEye sensitivity : No stinging\n\nPrice : 599 but you can get it under 300 for 50 grams\n\nProtection : 7/10, gives decent protection. Better than a lot of gimmicky sunscreens, but there are better ones out there. \n\nReapplication : Easy to re-apply but definitely feels heavy.\n\nMy experience: \n\nI mainly use it for indoors for two reasons :\n\n1. It works like moisturiser + sunscreen in one. I skip moisturizer as it is quite moisturising.\n\n2. Two fingers’ worth feels heavy on me, and makes me sweat and makes my face look a little dull. So for indoors I apply less amount and it works fine.\n\n\nBeen using it for about a year now. Earlier this was the only sunscreen I used, but I did notice slight tanning with outdoor sun exposure (even with 2 fingers worth). My only real issue is that it feels more like a moisturizer with an SPF, which works on most days but once you get tanned it’s hard to reverse, especially with the UV index in summers. For indoor, it does the job.\n\nVerdict : Would repurchase for indoor use only.",

      "content": "Post-Accutane relapse after 4 years. Dealing with texture &amp; breakouts. Need routine help!\n\nHello reddit!!! I'm looking for advice on building a sustainable skincare routine \n\nBackground: I was on Accutane from 2019 to 2021 and it went great (insert standard accutane story).\n\nHowever, after a couple of years, my skin has started breaking out again. I'm dealing with active breakouts but also post-acne scarring and texture.\n\nThe Problem: My biggest hurdle is consistency. I typically start a new routine, but as soon as I hi tthe \"breakout\" or \"purging\" stage, I panic and stop following through. It's becoming genuinely triggering for me-l've actually started having nightmares about my skin returning to its pre-Accutane state.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\n1. Recommendations for a routine that tackles texture and recurring breakouts (post-Accutane).\n\n2. Advice on how to power through the purge without quitting.\n\n3. Any product recommendations that might be gentler but effective?\n\nCurrent Routine: (I fell off this routine, as the purging triggered me)\n\n• AM: La Roche-Posay Toleraine Cleanser, ordinary ascorbyl glucoside 12%, ceraVe PM facial moisturizing, la roche-posaune SPF 30.\n\n• PM: La Roche-Posay Toleraine Cleanser, CeraVe skin renewing night cream\n\nI have Tazarotene and Benozyl Peroxide planned for alternating nights but this is where i struggled due to purging.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, and i want to get on top of this before it gets worse!

      "content": "Happy Sunday y’all. It’s another morning that I woke up with awful itching on my scalp. I don’t want to give the gory details, but I can’t get a hold on my scalp issues and my hair is a mess because of it. The holidays are coming up and I have some events to go to, so I really want to figure this out before then. It’s embarrassing and I hate it but I seriously have 0 clue what to do anymore.\n\nShampoos I’ve tried:\n\nHead and Shoulders (OG version) plus the Clinical Strength version (blue bottle)\n\nNeutrogena T-Gel and T-Sal \n\nNizoral \n\nSelsun Blue\n\nSephora Apple cider vinegar scrub shampoo\n\nCerave Anti-Dandruff \n\nAnd some others that I’ve forgotten about. Some were zinc-based, others had salicylic acid. I’ve tried apple cider vinegar rinses, coconut oil scrubs, washing every day, washing only once a week, brushing hair/not brushing, satin pillowcases and microfibre towels. I even bought a silicone scalp exfoliation thing from Amazon and although it wiped away the flakes the itchiness and flakiness is still there the next morning.\n\nI have curly hair, I let it air dry, and the only products I use are a curl cream and an oil (Argan oil or sometimes macadamia oil). \n\nI know the obvious answer after all this work is to see a dermatologist but it’s a 6 month wait (Canada) and I’m literally so embarrassed by this I don’t want to wait that long. I’ve been wearing beanies and berets on my head so people can’t see what a mess it is upstairs. Doesnt help that my hair is very dark brown so you can see it more clearly than if I was blonde.\n\nAt this point money is no object. I’d pay $500 for a bottle of elixir dandruff shampoo if it actually will work. I’m so done with this. And now that winter has set in where I am, the dryness and itchy feeling is getting even worse.\n\nIs there anything I’ve been missing? Anything I should try? I’m asking because the ladies on this sub seem to have so much wisdom when it comes to issues like this and I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore. I just want nice hair 😔\n\nThank you so much in advance. ❤️❤️\n\n",

No burn, no tingle.\n\nI thought the formulas had gone weak, so I tested both with pH strips.\nThe glycolic toner still shows pH ~3.5–4, and the peel gives that classic low-pH orange/red edge that strong acids normally show.\n\nSo the formulas are absolutely fine.\n\nThat’s when the concept of barrier adaptation made total sense.\n\nHere’s what actually happens:\n\nYour barrier gets stronger with consistent use. Early stinging is normal, but long-term users often stop feeling it.\n\nIf your routine already includes other actives (like lactic acid, vitamin C, glycolic masks), you’re already exfoliating → less reaction.\n\nMore hydration = less sting. Moisturizers, snail mucin, hyaluronic sunscreen all buffer acids naturally.\n\nHealthy skin doesn’t scream. Once your barrier is stable and non-irritated, acids feel mild regardless of pH.\n\nStinging is not a measurement of effectiveness. pH + concentration determine performance, not sensation.\n\nTL;DR:\nIf your acids stop stinging, it usually means your skin has adapted — not that the products lost strength.",

Got it after I ditched my Cerave Salycilic Acid wash)\n\n\\- Simple hydrating moisturise.\n\n\\- No sunscreens at the moment. They all break me out horribly.\n\nYes, I am stressed and my hormones have probably been completely whacked (periods have been all over the place). Sleep schedule is more or less regular. I’ve been told I have low bone density so started upping my dairy intake. I did get BP, but it seemed to make things worse. As did anti-dandruff shampoo. I wash my pillowcases and hair regularly and no products touch my forehead. I do sweat a lot though.\n\nCan’t really visit a dermatologist atm.

Recently I've noticed my hair falling out a lot (I'm M 20) my hair became thin and very weak where once it was thick and rather strong to the point often the barber said it jammed his trimmer. Now I'm loosing hair on my head but I noticed more hair now grows on my face and other places just not on my head. I often just run my hand through my hair and find like 1-3 hairs on my hand. When I shower and rub my scalp I end up with hair on my hands. When it comes to my showering routine I wash my hair every 2-3 days, I don't use any conditioners or styling products and never used them.\n\n Question is. What can I do? Any advice or anything that I can do aside from visiting a doctor?",

I’ve unfortunately never had anyone in my life to be able to show me what to do with curly hair, let alone my own. Now I know people say “oh just watch YouTube!” But I’ve tried and I never feel like I’m doing it right, and I give up (I know I shouldn’t). \n\nI’ve thought about trying another curly hair salon/cut but the prices are insane and I just quite simply can’t afford it, especially considering the last time someone told me they knew how to cut curly hair, I ended up with a “jellyfish cut” according to the next hair dresser who saw my hair. \n\nBut anyways here’s the info about my hair:\n\nWhen it first starts drying, it immediately is super frizzy and is in very loose very thin curls which I’m not too keen on. (not the type of curl youll see in the last photos, those are cute, but they only happen towards my scalp at the bottom of my head).\n\nIf I let my hair dry, and then brush it, obviously it is a massive frizzy mess, but once settled the bottom of my hair will curl, but that’s it and the top layer of my hair is ALWAYS so frizzy and has no curls no matter what I do, even when I just let it air dry without brushing, or even scrunching, and I HATE it!\n\nFor my routine: I’m currently using the “Kirsten ess the one” signature shampoo and conditioner however I feel like my hair is so dry and almost sticky after using it (sticky might not be the right word), but it’s like there’s left over stuff in my hair no matter how much I rinse it. After that I use a renewing argon oil of Morocco oil, and I use this almost daily too on my lengths and ends if needed. I have silk pillowcases, but no bonnet or anything since I see no point if my hair is just straight and frizzy \n\nPhotos attached:\nThe photos where I have blonde hair are from a couple years ago, and I’ve never seen my hair like this again since, I truly have NO idea what I did to get my hair like this, but I know I did something.. but I absolutely love how my hair looks curl wise and I wish I could replicate it.\n\nThe other photos is what my hair is like now/pretty much all of the time.\n\nIf anyone has any tips or advice, I’d love to know. I don’t know what my curl pattern is or anything so I feel pretty lost. I’m the only one in my family with curly hair and unfortunately don’t have any curly haired friends. \n",
