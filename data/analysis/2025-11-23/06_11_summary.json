      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "title": "A one year treatment journey - a trip back to confidence land",
      "content": "Hey everyone, I've been on my hair loss protocol for a year, and I will be reporting on progress, side effects, maximizing efficacy and future plans.\n\nAbout me:\nM30. At 29 noticed that I was going full Vegeta mode and was faced with either: shaving it off, or going on meds.\n\nI am a medical doctor. Now, I am not a dermatologist, I am a surgical resident, but even in my profession there is a ton of fear mongering regarding fin. I remember back in med school even some dermatologists would push the whole side effect ideas (same goes for nephrologists saying taking protein fucks with your kidney - it doesn't). So naturally when first noticing that I was going bald, I was like: fuck it, I'm shaving it off, I'd rather be bald with a functioning dick than have hair and be impotent. But as it turns out, it's not as linear as it seems.\n\nOutside the hospital I lift, and have been for 7 years now. I've also been an amateur boxer for 6 years, competing at national level for most of those years. Right now I only train to look good naked and keep my skills sharp. I've been on creatine this whole time, which may or may not have exacerbated my hair loss. Don't know. There are studies saying it's safe overall. But why does the most studied supplement not have a study directly evaluating its effect on hair loss? It's like as if someone doesn't want that study made. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.  (tips tinfoil hat) \n\nSo when faced with this choice, I decided that I would do a deep dive into existing literature at the time and after a week of reading a fuckton of articles and meta-analyses I decided it was safe enough to try.  As I took that first pill I basically pictured my dick falling off and my gf leaving me for Chad Thundercock the very next week. In reality, nothing happened. \n\nMy stack:\n\n- Finasteride 1mg per day for 1 month. Later on I wrote myself a script for 5mg tablets and was taking 1.25mg every day; Eventually at around the 6 month mark I dialed down to 1.25mg every other day and this is the protocol I maintain until this day;\n\n- Ketokonazole shampoo twice a week; Honestly I stopped this one after the bottle ran out. It's expensive as fuck, the bottle is small, it wrecks your hair, and the results are minimal. It's an addition to the stack, but I found out soon enough that it wasn't moving the needle for me as much as the other things;\n\n- Retinol cream in target areas after shower at night, then 10 minutes after I'd apply Topical 5% minoxidil;\n\n- Dr. pen derma pen 1mm once a week (sticking to 1mm coz when I was younger I took isotretinoin for 2 years and my skin is incredibly thin). Also coming to work with a scabbing forehead is not very appealing.\n\nHaircare:\n- High quality shampoo, conditioner, mask, hydrating gels and high quality clay for styling;\n\nResult timeline:\n\nPic 1: Holidays in France, looked at the photos and went into shock as I was feeling my temples recede into next dimension, and the hair becoming brittle. I was horrified a month later that when at my barber's, I could literally see the wall behind me through my hair. That fucking crushed my confidence like nothing else. \n\nPic 2: This is the day I started taking meds. Going fast and furious into NW3 territory with no regard for anyone or anything. Diffuse thinning on the crown out the wazoo. The Norwood reaper does not forgive and does not forget.  \n\nPic 3-4: These pictures are me around 2 months into treatment. Lots of baby hairs started coming through, specially on my left side, on which the recession is way more agressive. Hair at the front junction started looking stronger, and my barber immediately noticed that my hair got better.  Around this time I stopped having that annoying ass itch at the back of my head, that every time I scratched, I noticed a dozen hairs coming out. Also around this time I stopped having tons of hair coming out when I shower and style my hair. Now I only see around 5 hairs on my hands when I run through them after shampooing. \n\nPic 5-6 - Decided to grow it out and see what I can work with. Looks pretty good, but I was abroad for 2 months, so the only treatment I could keep up with was fin + min. This is around the 5/6 month mark. Honestly feeling like I got my life back.\n\nPic 7 - This was taken on the 1 year mark of treatment. On this day I had an interview and took out the big guns with the outfit and hairstyle. Honestly looks amazing and I can't believe I almost fell for the the bait and shaved it off.  At this point I'm about a NW 1.5. Looks good enough that I don't need a transplant and looks very natural. I still have baby hairs coming through, specially on the left side (which was always worse in terms of hairloss and you can actually see it in the photo). At this moment I'm looking to fill the left side a bit more since it's the one with the worst growth. I'm increasing dermapen frequency and probably adding more minoxidil to that side\n\nPlans for the future: Keep the current treatment ad eternum. Maybe dabble with some new treatments as the years go by. Decided I will grow my hair out again and give the slick back another go, actually loved it at the time, but ended up getting a haircut for my graduation.\n\nSide effects: My semen became thicker. No issues with erections or sex drive, if anything sex drive went up due to more free test. \nNo mental side effects, but I've always been mentally stable, chill and balanced.\n\nMy personal opinion on the whole side effect notion:\n\nIf you are healthy of body and at least somewhat mentally stable, you should have no issues. If you go on runs, if you lift weights and eat like a healthy person, you should have no issues.\n\nMy personal opinion and theory is that the sexual side effects are probably most prevalent in high body fat individuals. \n\nYour body converts testosterone into estrogen in peripheral fat. If you eat like a pig and are overweight (chances are that you are), then probably your Test:E2 ratio is heavily skewed. You take finasteride which increases testosterone as an indirect effect -&gt; more test gets converted into estrogen -&gt; peepee stops working and mental goes boom boom.\n\n(this is not established science nor a professional opinion, just a thought exercise. )",

Dry with microfiber towel and air dry. \n\nFavorite products: TGIN leave in, Pillow soft curls leave in, boucleme gel or unkle funkys on the rare occasion I use gel, Palmer’s coconut oil rinse out conditioner. \nProducts tend to get MOSTLY absorbed but still leaves residue using even a bit too much; it’s hard to get product through dense hair.

      "content": "Hey all. Im looking for advice on how to up my skincare game!\n\nI’m not completely new to the idea, but I’m close to it. I realize I should’ve started years ago, but better late than never right?\n\nI just turned 40 this year, and I currently have the most basic of basic routines. I know there are things I can do to improve my overall skin health though. So I figured the experts in here can help point me in the right direction as far as products and first-hand knowledge!\n\nFor a reference point, I don’t have acne or discoloration issues, I avoid the sun like it’s a death ray, I try to stay hydrated, and I use nightly cream applications of vitamin C and pea peptides.\n\nI guess what I really want to know is, what key things do I need to add/change to my routine to help flesh out the missing pieces? Also, what are some good cleansers I can use? In addition, any anti-aging suggestions are welcomed!\n\nThanks in advance!",

I haven't changed a whole lot about my routine since this started. I did change a few things to try and help it, but nothing is working. \n\nMy original routine was wash once or twice a week only and usually with clarifying shampoo to prevent product buildup. Then follow up with a bonding or hydrating conditioner (I use Elizavecca CER-100 or Olaplex for bonding). After I get out of the shower, leave-in conditioner and hair gel. Then air dry and lightly scrunch with a cotton t-shirt. My hair always came out silky smooth with nice shine and curl. I would use a curling iron or straightener to help with the strands on the top layers that refuse to curl no matter what I try, but that was the only heat I was using during that time. The only major change that I can think of that contributed to the frizz was that I moved about 200 miles away from where I was living before. So I thought maybe environmental factors or water type/quality had something to do with it? \n\nMy routine after showering has changed - I now use The Doux foam and and heat protectant and will blow dry my hair with a diffuser after it has air-dried some. \n\nPlease recommend any products that might help! I'm open to almost anything and honestly have not tried very many yet. ",

Recently I've struggled to find a good moisturizer or leave-in-conditioner so my hair feels dry. Do I need to wash my hair more? Or differently?\nMy routine:\n1.I shampoo and conditioner my hair twice each wash day which is about 3 days in between sometimes 4, and I use Sally's beauty general product \n\n2. I've gone back and forth between a few leave in conditioners but right now its jusy not my mother's leave in, and I've used the general product one. I've used the Miss Jessie's curl puddy. I also occasionally use the not my mother's foam. I only apply product when my hair is wet/damp.\n\n3. Most of the time I air dry my hair because diffusing causes a bunch of frizz\n\n4. I sleep in a silk bonnet, although it does fall off some nights. I do have a satin pillowcase as well. I shower more at nights and then wet down in the morning and it looks pretty good. My hair will look good for about 2 days before it starts getting messy but I am worried about over washing my hair.\nAny advice is appreciated ",

(I think a mix of 2c with random 3a pieces) I’ve had issues with my hair until recently. I had a whole year of pure stress which made my hair FLAT and almost barely wavy but now I’m getting my old bounce back. Problem is that it lays flat against my head at times and doesn’t want to stay up. I love full volume, think of the 80s. I need SOMETHING accessible that most beauty supply stores have that can help give more texture and OOMF to my roots. My current routine is on damp hair: Jamaican castor oil spray, curl&amp;wave mousse and extra volume sculpting gel. I scrunch everything in one at a time and either let it air dry if I have time or use is diffuser for a while to fully dry it. I try and focus my roots but nothing works :( I only style it dry with some mists from my castor oil spray which kinda rehydrates my hair for a scrunch and go if I can’t wash my hair. Any suggestions?",

      "content": "About 5 months ago my partner developed a ringworm on her arm. Unfortunately I passed it onto her as my field of work is within sport. Nothing out of the ordinary and I have had it previously a few times. I always just used over the counter cream (caneston, lamisil etc…) and it would take a good month or 2 to go, but would go.\n\nOnce we discovered it on her arm around 5 months ago, we instantly started treatment with the same creams I’d used. Unfortunately they were having zero effect on her ringworm, and she ended up having another one pop up on her leg. We consulted with a doctor who prescribed a steroid cream aswell as tablets. This seemed to help initially, until it randomly got aggressive again and out of control.\n\nWe consulted a second doctor who believed it wasn’t even ringworm (we know it definitely was) and she said there was definitely damage to the skin from the steroid cream but nothing major and to just stop everything and leave it. About 3 days after this appointment everything flared up, even new ringworms popped up too on her leg. This led to seeking advice from a 3rd doctor which he said it was still active ringworm, and requested a scrape and blood test (still waiting for results). He advised to just use over the counter cream for now until the results come back, but even since the 3rd doctor visit, it has gotten worse (the picture I’ve attached). Nothing we try is working, you name it, we’ve tried it. This is taking serious toll on her mental health and confidence, and she’s constantly itchy. We are seeking urgent advice and or remedies as we are at a complete standstill still and have no idea what else we can do. We can’t get into any dermatologist for at least a year, and all doctors appointments have to be weeks in advance. Please help us in anyway and guide us with your experiences. Thankyou\n\n",
