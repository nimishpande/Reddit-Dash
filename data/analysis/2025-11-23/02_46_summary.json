      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

The bottom doesn’t look too bad but the top is atrocious. At my wit’s end honestly. \n\nI want to try the split end trimmer but waiting for an updated model with better blades as the main complaint is that they work but not well. \n\nRoutine: Deep condition once a month, co-wash 2-3 times a week, wear as a wash and go with leave-in and nothing else. Dry with microfiber towel and air dry. \n\nFavorite products: TGIN leave in, Pillow soft curls leave in, boucleme gel or unkle funkys on the rare occasion I use gel, Palmer’s coconut oil rinse out conditioner. \nProducts tend to get MOSTLY absorbed but still leaves residue using even a bit too much; it’s hard to get product through dense hair.

I realize I should’ve started years ago, but better late than never right?\n\nI just turned 40 this year, and I currently have the most basic of basic routines. I know there are things I can do to improve my overall skin health though. So I figured the experts in here can help point me in the right direction as far as products and first-hand knowledge!\n\nFor a reference point, I don’t have acne or discoloration issues, I avoid the sun like it’s a death ray, I try to stay hydrated, and I use nightly cream applications of vitamin C and pea peptides.\n\nI guess what I really want to know is, what key things do I need to add/change to my routine to help flesh out the missing pieces? Also, what are some good cleansers I can use? In addition, any anti-aging suggestions are welcomed!\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "title": "A one year treatment journey - a trip back to confidence land",
      "content": "Hey everyone, I've been on my hair loss protocol for a year, and I will be reporting on progress, side effects, maximizing efficacy and future plans.\n\nAbout me:\nM30. At 29 noticed that I was going full Vegeta mode and was faced with either: shaving it off, or going on meds.\n\nI am a medical doctor. Now, I am not a dermatologist, I am a surgical resident, but even in my profession there is a ton of fear mongering regarding fin. I remember back in med school even some dermatologists would push the whole side effect ideas (same goes for nephrologists saying taking protein fucks with your kidney - it doesn't). So naturally when first noticing that I was going bald, I was like: fuck it, I'm shaving it off, I'd rather be bald with a functioning dick than have hair and be impotent. But as it turns out, it's not as linear as it seems.\n\nOutside the hospital I lift, and have been for 7 years now. I've also been an amateur boxer for 6 years, competing at national level for most of those years. Right now I only train to look good naked and keep my skills sharp. I've been on creatine this whole time, which may or may not have exacerbated my hair loss. Don't know. There are studies saying it's safe overall. But why does the most studied supplement not have a study directly evaluating its effect on hair loss? It's like as if someone doesn't want that study made. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.  (tips tinfoil hat) \n\nSo when faced with this choice, I decided that I would do a deep dive into existing literature at the time and after a week of reading a fuckton of articles and meta-analyses I decided it was safe enough to try.  As I took that first pill I basically pictured my dick falling off and my gf leaving me for Chad Thundercock the very next week. In reality, nothing happened. \n\nMy stack:\n\n- Finasteride 1mg per day for 1 month. Later on I wrote myself a script for 5mg tablets and was taking 1.25mg every day; Eventually at around the 6 month mark I dialed down to 1.25mg every other day and this is the protocol I maintain until this day;\n\n- Ketokonazole shampoo twice a week; Honestly I stopped this one after the bottle ran out. It's expensive as fuck, the bottle is small, it wrecks your hair, and the results are minimal. It's an addition to the stack, but I found out soon enough that it wasn't moving the needle for me as much as the other things;\n\n- Retinol cream in target areas after shower at night, then 10 minutes after I'd apply Topical 5% minoxidil;\n\n- Dr. pen derma pen 1mm once a week (sticking to 1mm coz when I was younger I took isotretinoin for 2 years and my skin is incredibly thin). Also coming to work with a scabbing forehead is not very appealing.\n\nHaircare:\n- High quality shampoo, conditioner, mask, hydrating gels and high quality clay for styling;\n\nResult timeline:\n\nPic 1: Holidays in France, looked at the photos and went into shock as I was feeling my temples recede into next dimension, and the hair becoming brittle. I was horrified a month later that when at my barber's, I could literally see the wall behind me through my hair. That fucking crushed my confidence like nothing else. \n\nPic 2: This is the day I started taking meds. Going fast and furious into NW3 territory with no regard for anyone or anything. Diffuse thinning on the crown out the wazoo. The Norwood reaper does not forgive and does not forget.  \n\nPic 3-4: These pictures are me around 2 months into treatment. Lots of baby hairs started coming through, specially on my left side, on which the recession is way more agressive. Hair at the front junction started looking stronger, and my barber immediately noticed that my hair got better.  Around this time I stopped having that annoying ass itch at the back of my head, that every time I scratched, I noticed a dozen hairs coming out. Also around this time I stopped having tons of hair coming out when I shower and style my hair. Now I only see around 5 hairs on my hands when I run through them after shampooing. \n\nPic 5-6 - Decided to grow it out and see what I can work with. Looks pretty good, but I was abroad for 2 months, so the only treatment I could keep up with was fin + min. This is around the 5/6 month mark. Honestly feeling like I got my life back.\n\nPic 7 - This was taken on the 1 year mark of treatment. On this day I had an interview and took out the big guns with the outfit and hairstyle. Honestly looks amazing and I can't believe I almost fell for the the bait and shaved it off.  At this point I'm about a NW 1.5. Looks good enough that I don't need a transplant and looks very natural. I still have baby hairs coming through, specially on the left side (which was always worse in terms of hairloss and you can actually see it in the photo). At this moment I'm looking to fill the left side a bit more since it's the one with the worst growth. I'm increasing dermapen frequency and probably adding more minoxidil to that side\n\nPlans for the future: Keep the current treatment ad eternum. Maybe dabble with some new treatments as the years go by. Decided I will grow my hair out again and give the slick back another go, actually loved it at the time, but ended up getting a haircut for my graduation.\n\nSide effects: My semen became thicker. No issues with erections or sex drive, if anything sex drive went up due to more free test. \nNo mental side effects, but I've always been mentally stable, chill and balanced.\n\nMy personal opinion on the whole side effect notion:\n\nIf you are healthy of body and at least somewhat mentally stable, you should have no issues. If you go on runs, if you lift weights and eat like a healthy person, you should have no issues.\n\nMy personal opinion and theory is that the sexual side effects are probably most prevalent in high body fat individuals. \n\nYour body converts testosterone into estrogen in peripheral fat. If you eat like a pig and are overweight (chances are that you are), then probably your Test:E2 ratio is heavily skewed. You take finasteride which increases testosterone as an indirect effect -&gt; more test gets converted into estrogen -&gt; peepee stops working and mental goes boom boom.\n\n(this is not established science nor a professional opinion, just a thought exercise. )",

I had a whole year of pure stress which made my hair FLAT and almost barely wavy but now I’m getting my old bounce back. Problem is that it lays flat against my head at times and doesn’t want to stay up. I love full volume, think of the 80s. I need SOMETHING accessible that most beauty supply stores have that can help give more texture and OOMF to my roots. My current routine is on damp hair: Jamaican castor oil spray, curl&amp;wave mousse and extra volume sculpting gel. I scrunch everything in one at a time and either let it air dry if I have time or use is diffuser for a while to fully dry it. I try and focus my roots but nothing works :( I only style it dry with some mists from my castor oil spray which kinda rehydrates my hair for a scrunch and go if I can’t wash my hair.

      "title": "3/3 for this gel!",
      "content": "Okay my last time updating about pretty curl girl strong hold gel 😅\n\nThis is the 3rd time I've styled with it. It's fragrance free and concentrated. 100ml/3.5 ounces lasted me 3 styles, 3rd being today.\n\nThe last two times, I could wake up and untie my hair with satisfaction for 4 days. Sometimes I restyle on the 4th, typically after 5 or later if it's like the weekend and I won't be going anywhere. Refreshing has never worked for me, just causes frizz and I don't like adding more product to my hair between washes except to my bangs if they get really messy from sleeping weird.\n\nI don't think I get flaking from this product (i have scalp issues that I've went to doctors about for 10 years now to no avail, seeing a new person next month but not holding my breath). I feel like the cast is strong but flexible. I'm currently pedestrian-only in a windy country I'm foreign to as I just moved here and my licence is not valid. My hair survives well those first 3 days. I think day 5 wouldn't look so great but I don't know. Unsure about day 4. I guess it depends.\n\nI absolutely HATE doing my hair so it's nice to worry about it a little less with this fantastic gel, I just wish it came in a large amount like the curlsmith I was using does lol.\n\nIf I miss a spot or just dont like how a section turned out, I rewet it, add a little more gel, scrunch/finger coil and diffuse again. I'll do this as late as the day after wash/diffuse day.\n\nRoutine is either curlsmith hydrating shampoo/conditioner OR double clarify followed by amika protein deep conditioner OR bumble &amp; bumble cowash (purple label); redken united leave in or redken acidic curl bonding 16% (one area of my hair is extremely low porosity and dries within 2 minutes so the acidic bonding helps but I was told not to make it make main product i just use it for 2-4 weeks then go back to the united leave in), if using acidic bonding, i spray thermal protection as well (was using chi but switching to indola), and then the gel. I try to put all my product in after showering but I have a hard time detangling in or out of the shower (with conditioner) so I do my best before adding product, plopping in a hair turban for 10-30 minutes (depends on how ugh I'm feeling about getting it done lol) and the I detangle/style again at my vanity, adding a little more gel and water to places I typically miss when bent over in the shower adding the product (the roots in the back usually). I have so knock off bounce curl brush i define with after redistributing product with my tangle teezer.\n\nI can never really get my bangs how I want but I don't wanna experiment with them too much because that just leads to me cutting more hair lmao. Unsure if they're even cut okay. They were fine at first but after a few washes, the line where they're divided at look a bit uneven but I don't see any missed hairs to pull back down where they belong 🤷‍♀️ in this pic my bangs are not totally dry so I haven't spread them out yet. If i do it too early it gets stringy which leads to frizz. I use a bonnet and silk pillowcase but they don't really help with bangs. If i put them in the bonnet, it's the same as if I tie them up. They're in a different direction. So i leave them pushed down at the root with the bonnet. (Like the elastic is ON the top of bangs).\n\nWhen my hair is COMPLETELY dry and satisfactory, I oil my scalp with a jojoba mix of rosemary and castor. Trying to thicken it up after it all fell out from stress in 2018 :/ was 4x thicker than now and about 5 inches longer. Had to cut off a lot of growth due to using innersense gel. I want my hair back at my waist 😭\n\nIf it matters (according to my old curly stylist it does) I'm black, Filipino, indigenous american Indian, Spanish and white. Dominance is Spanish and black but apparently I just look like \"some kind of islander\" 😂 ",

      "content": "Just wanted to share what I've learned after testing a few LED masks recently, especially about the difference between red and blue light therapies for skin.\n\nI picked up a Glotech mask from LED Esthetics since it covers both red and blue wavelengths. At first, I wasn't sure if I really needed both, but after a month of daily sessions, I noticed some interesting changes:\n\n- Red light: Helped soften fine lines and made my skin look a bit firmer over time. I started seeing a noticeable glow and better overall texture, especially on drier patches.\n\n- Blue light: Was more of a game changer for breakouts and random patches of redness. Used this on days when my skin felt oily or inflamed much fewer breakouts, and the old marks faded faster.\n\nTbh I think using both gave me the best of both worlds. Red light is awesome for anti-aging and texture, while blue is great if you deal with acne or frequent spots. If you're only picking one, think about your main skin concern, but for me, a mask offering both was worth the investment and made the whole routine pretty easy.",

      "content": "Embarrassed to be posting these, but looking for some general advice for my skin on my chin area. I’ve already gone to the dermatologist and will add my skincare routine below. I am 27f.\n\nMy skin is overall clear except for on my chin. I have hirsutism and cystic acne on both sides of my chin. It’s not too bad currently (these pictures), but still very apparent. I pluck my chin hairs every three- ish days, but they grow back so fast and thick/ dark. Ive never shaved them, and im hesitant to try laser hair removal as I’ve heard mixed reviews. Electrolysis unfortunately is too expensive for me right now. I asked my dermatologist if there was a hair removal cream that could be prescribed and she said no, and that there’s plenty of OTC hair removal creams. Wondering what works for other people who have hirsutism on their face?\n\nFor my acne, I’ve tried different benzoyl peroxide facewashes, and a prescription sulfur face wash. Nothing seems to really clear up my chin. Acne is persistent during my entire cycle. I recently got my hormones checked with a blood test and my labs came back totally normal. I clean my phone screen and I don’t really touch the area on my face. I’m just not sure what else I can do. Any advice would be so appreciated. Thank you in advance.\n\nSkincare routine: AM: prescription sulfur facewash, vanicream moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, EltaMD sunscreen\n\nPM:prescription sulfur facewash, vanicream moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, tretinoin 0.1%.",
