For conditioner, I used to use Elvive, but about a month ago I switched to Dove’s curly hair conditioner. Since switching, I’ve noticed a small improvement my curls feel a bit more defined and slightly less frizzy.\n\nmy routine: I detangle my hair in the shower, then apply shampoo (not always), followed by conditioner. Most of the time I let my hair air dry, but if there’s a special occasion, I’ll sleep with it wet on my pillow. I discovered this by accident once, and it actually makes my curls look way better, almost like they’ve been diffused. If I just air-dry, my hair usually ends up looking more like in the picture I attached.\n\nThe main problem I have is frizz near the roots, especially since I have to brush my hair often for school. Any tips on how to manage that? Also, I’d like more volume should I get a haircut to help with that? And any recommended products? I know i am asking alot, but any sort of advice is appreciated : D",

      "content": "Hey yall! \nSo I’ve recently embraced my curly hair,  and it’s a learning curve for sure. Some days are better than others,  and I’m trying to find good products. \nThis is my routine- \n\n1-Wash and condition with design me- puff me shampoo &amp; conditioner (switching to the bounce me stuff once I run out) I also use a clarifying shampoo once a month (olaplex) followed by k 18, and then the design me gloss me hair mask to restore moisture. \n2- I use the Verb curl cream, apply it evenly through hair and brush through,  7 second leave in conditioner spray, and then I use the bounce me mousse and I scrunch, also I use a microfibre hair towel to scrunch and get the excess moisture out. \n3-sometimes I use the verb foaming gel,  and I lightly diffuse. Then after it’s completely dry,  I use verb ghost oil and I scrunch the crunch. \n\nI’ve only been doing this routine for 2 weeks. After 25 years of not taking care of my curls,  and likely head damaged and colour damage as well. But I want them to look nicer. I used to have ringlets when I was little,  it’s more of a wave now but I get some super curly pieces. I just want it to look nice lol. Any tips would be appreciated ",

      "content": "So, I saw a dermatologist yesterday for a growing lump I’ve been having for over six months that has been steadily growing. It was pearlescent in color after three months of having it, the first three months having been pink like a small pimple that never went away. It was irregular in shape and had a weird edge on it. My PCP wanted it biopsied, but when I saw the dermatologist she ran me through removal so fast that I had a hard time advocating for myself due to feeling like I was on a type of medical conveyor-belt of sorts.\n\nShe ended up removing it and cauterizing where it was; but when she first attempted to lance it (despite me telling the nurse it was hard) she did not numb the area at all. No cream. No injection. She just started jabbing at it. I told her it hurt a lot and she said “Mmm, I don’t know about a /lot/.”\n\nAfter prodding it for a bit longer she THEN decided to numb the area with an injection before removing it. Also there was no aftercare instructions and she forgot to send in the script for a topical antibiotic even though the receptionist said she would “before the end of the day”.\n\nI’m just wondering if the not-numbing thing is normal. The visit itself was wack as hell and I won’t be going back, but I need to know what is standard and what is not before filing a complaint about this clinician. I guess I also want assurance too if this was as wack as I think it was 😭",

      "content": "I have to admit, I’ve always loved glass skin.\n\nI’m in my early thirties, so even before pre-K beauty trends reached our side of the world, I was the kid slathering Vaseline on my skin because I loved the way it looked.\n\nI’m in a weird limbo where I see many women younger than me, my age, and older indulging in expensive beauty treatments (I.e Botox, filler, lasers, etc.). \n\nI’m hesitant to join this trend and I don’t know if I’d be able to resist going overboard. What if I start and can’t stop? What if I start and regret it?\n\nIn any case, I’m fortunate to have good skin genetically. My goal has been to find a low maintenance skin routine that gives me glowing skin, that can act as a good base for makeup or be sufficient on its own. My goal has been to have glowy hydrated skin in the hopes it will help delay any visible signs of aging. I also used to spend frivolously on higher end skincare, and got tired of the fancy bottles and scents that didn’t really do much for my skin. I’ve found my products for lasting glowy and healthy skin, and it’s all reasonably priced. \n\n1. **Always wash your face**. I use Cetaphil’s hydrating cream to foam wash ($16) and it lasts a long time, removes all makeup, and doesn’t have any harsh scents. \n\nI used to use more expensive face washes from\nOrigins, but found this a year ago and won’t go back to anything else.\n\n2. **Toner / keep face wet** before applying moisturizer. I mean, it makes sense that in order to lock moisture in, there should be some moisture already on the skin (and you should be internally well hydrated). I was using Cetaphil’s radiance toner $24 and loved it. However, I just bought Aestura’s moisturizing cream mist $29 and love that it leaves a creamy dew behind. I alternate between these.\n\n3. **Moisturizer:** I have been using Cetaphil’s optimal hydration lotion ($17) daily. It’s scent free and radiant, and leaves the skin visibly glowy. I recently purchased the Cosrx ceramide skin barrier moisturizer ($27) and alternate between the two. I love them both! Cosrx is a bit more “greasy”, which I’m okay with, but Cetaphil absorbs a bit better. Before this step, I sometimes use the Snail essence from Cosrx ($20) if I really want to shine, but don’t do it daily. \n\n4. **Eye cream:** Cetaphil’s optimal hydration eye serum ($17) leaves a hydrating glow around the eyes without scent or irritation. I’m thinking about trying Aestura or Cosrx next. Either way, I won’t stop using Cetaphil’s as it’s checked all the boxes of providing perfect hydration without being overwhelmingly heavy or scented.\n\nI always spray my skin again at the end, either with a water spray or Aestura from step 2. If I have time, I’ll turn on my face steamer for a few seconds at the end to leave a veil of moisture on top of everything. Without fail, this always keeps my skin glowing for the entirety of the day! \n\n\n\n",

I've heard to use a lot of conditioner on the ends, especially if you have knots, until you can run your fingers through without much resistance, then go in with a wide tooth comb. Is that true? Also this last time I showered I wasn't able to get all of my hair wet it feels like. Normally I would brush my hair before my shower but I heard that was bad and I should be (gently) combing in the shower instead. I didn't learn that till after my shower though.\n\nSo is that conditioner thing true? Should I wash out all of the conditioner? Or leave some in? What about shampoo? Also, what are some other things I should be doing as well?\n\nShampoo and conditioner are the Aussie total miracle with apricot oil\n\nMousse is Tresemme flawless curs w/ coconut and avocado oil\n\nHair is wrapped in a microfiber tshirt, or a regular 100% cotton tshirt, whichever I have on hand\n\n",
