At first everything was great — my pores and blackheads disappeared, I had some small breakouts but nothing major, and after that my skin looked amazing. But around July things started to get worse again: lots of texture, a lot of inflammation, and honestly my skin now looks even worse than before.\n\nAccording to my dermatologist, my treatment could have ended in July since I barely had any acne left on my face (most of it was on my body). So we began tapering down the dose: first three times a week, then once a week. But that’s when things really got worse. I went back to her, and she said she’s not entirely sure what it could be — it seems like follicular acne, not fungal, because there’s no flaking or signs of a compromised skin barrier. Her advice was to go back on daily Accutane and wait to see how things progress.\n\nShe even told me to buy two more boxes for the next two months. In total i have 2 months and 15 days of medication left. Do you think this will eventually resolve? I’ve already tried ceramides (thinking it was barrier related), azelaic acid to reduce redness, light moisturizers, heavy repairing moisturizers… but nothing seems to help.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?\n",

This is what i use tho. My bang pieces are a bit frizzy and have a bit trouble forming curls like some other pieces of hair. I also want my hair to curl from the room and i lack a lot of volume i feel like. will finger curling help more??? and will diffusing my har also help??? should i start using hair masks?? recommend products PLEASEE!!! thank uuu :)) routine:\n1. recently started using l am shampoo and conditioner\n2. i section my hair and wet my hair with wayer and i use rizzo curl cream, camille rose honey leave in conditioner, marc anthony mousee, not your mothers gel\n3. scrunch my hair w a Tshirt and when dry (airdried) i use hairtage argan hair oil. 4.i sleep with a satin bonnet",
