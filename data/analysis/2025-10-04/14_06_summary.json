For conditioner, I used to use Elvive, but about a month ago I switched to Dove’s curly hair conditioner. Since switching, I’ve noticed a small improvement my curls feel a bit more defined and slightly less frizzy.\n\nmy routine: I detangle my hair in the shower, then apply shampoo (not always), followed by conditioner. Most of the time I let my hair air dry, but if there’s a special occasion, I’ll sleep with it wet on my pillow. I discovered this by accident once, and it actually makes my curls look way better, almost like they’ve been diffused. If I just air-dry, my hair usually ends up looking more like in the picture I attached.\n\nThe main problem I have is frizz near the roots, especially since I have to brush my hair often for school. Any tips on how to manage that? Also, I’d like more volume should I get a haircut to help with that? And any recommended products? I know i am asking alot, but any sort of advice is appreciated : D",

Before starting skincare, I didn’t really have many active acne—mostly scars &amp; open pores from old breakouts.\n\nAbout 3 months ago, I started a simple routine:\n\nCleanser: Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n\nMoisturizer: Minimalist Vitamin B5 Moisturizer\n\nSunscreen: Deconstruct SPF 55\n\n\nBut after 2 months of this routine, my skin got worse. I now have:\n\nMany acne bumps (some painful)\n\nBlack marks / post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation\n\nOpen pores\n\n\nI’ve researched products specially made for oily/acne-prone skin, but most seem to have negative reviews, so I’m confused about what actually works.\n\nI want to ask my brothers &amp; sisters of this sub:\n👉 Have you faced something similar?\n👉 What products or routines actually helped you get rid of acne, reduce scars, and control oil without making things worse?\n\nI’d really appreciate any honest advice or personal experiences 🙏\n",
