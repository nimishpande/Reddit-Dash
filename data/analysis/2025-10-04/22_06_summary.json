Sorry if that's too vague.\n\nAlso some things to point out!\n\n1.If you have any suggestions on how to place my eyeliner please share, I have a slight lazy eye (right side) so anything tailored to that helps especially because I'm struggling with both sides being the same shape! \n\n2. I'm using a dark brown mascara and eyeliner if that helps with any assessments.\n\n\nPlease feel free to ask any other questions! \n\n",

The first photo is my products. The 2-6th photos are ones i took today after I woke up. My hair is half dry in weird spots, and just so frizzy and puffy and feels oily. I usually just end up putting it in a bun when it‚Äôs like this so it typically dries straight ish and puffy. The 7th photo is after a haircut I got two weeks ago, and she made it look great! But then the 8th photo is same day as haircut and it still just looks dry and puffy on my roots while the ends are more moisturized and defined.  Is there anything I can do to get mine like the last two? \n\nMy routine is:\n- Was hair every two days\n- Once a week clarifying shampoo (Suave)\n- Shea moisture conditioner every wash \n- After shower smooth in hair cream (pillow soft curls) \n- Then curlsmith curl conditioner\n- Lastly scrunch up with gel \n- I mostly shower at night, so I air dry and it dries overnight (barely)\n\nI know there are probably soo many things wrong with my routine, please please help.

      "title": "[Routine Help] A (Hopefully) Comprehensive Patch Testing Guide for Facial Skincare",
      "content": "I've done a major overhaul of my skincare this year which required a ton of research and experimentation - patch testing techniques were a big challenge in this process, as it was difficult to find detailed guidance. So this is a combination of what I've found through research and learned through experimentation (on myself, so, disclaimer - YMMV); hopefully it offers something more than what's already out there! Additions welcome - if others have found other and/or better methods, please share! I'd love to expand on this to make it as useful as possible.\n\n  \n**Key principle to keep in mind:**\n\nWhen testing products, it's important to remember that positive and negative reactions are related to both ingredients and concentrations, so you will learn much more from testing products with only a single or a few ingredients than you will from testing products with more complex formulas. This guide is just for how to test, not for how to decide what to try.\n\nIf you are trying to build a better understanding of how to manage your skincare needs overall and improve how you select products to try (and avoid endless testing of products that don't work for you), you will need to combine research and experimentation to understand what works for you at the ingredient level. (Can do a separate post on this if there's interest).\n\n\n\n**How to use this guide:**\n\nDepending on your skin type and needs, you may not need to follow every step in this method (I don't) - I've written it as a single process with every possible step that I could find/identify, but the best way to use it is to select the steps that you feel would be beneficial for your needs, and follow them in the same sequence as laid out here. Testing new products requires a tradeoff between risk (consequences of a negative reaction to the product) and discovery/explanatory power (how much you can learn about how/whether the product will work for you as part of a skincare routine), so each step is a test in and of itself, and they've been ordered from lowest to highest risk &amp; explanatory power. More steps = more cautious, fewer steps = faster. \n\nIf you do not experience any negative reactions from one test, move on to the next one you have selected, until you have either determined that you should stop using the product, or tested it sufficiently to feel comfortable including it as a regular product in your routine.\n\n  \n**General notes for all tests:**\n\n* Do not continue any step/test for the recommended duration unless no negative reaction occurs. If you develop a negative reaction to the product you're testing at any point during a specific test, remove the product and discontinue use immediately. If you have an allergic or severe irritation reaction, treat according to medical advice.\n* Re-apply if the product has come off during a test period. If you shower, are sweating, the product could have been wiped off during activity or by clothing, etc, re-apply it. \n* For patch tests on parts of the body where the product is more likely to be rubbed off, e.g. the forearm, you can apply a non-absorbent bandage or patch over the test area once you have applied it and it has dried to prevent it being rubbed off without you realizing. Band-aids are not non-absorbent, but you can apply some extra product to the absorbent pad on the band-aid before putting it over the test area to help balance this out.\n* Allergies vs irritation/breakouts: allergic reactions are more likely to occur in shorter periods (within 48h of application, plus another 72-96h for delayed reactions), whereas irritation reactions can take time to build up. I have outlined tests for allergic reactions and irritation as separate tests to be as thorough as possible, but they can be combined. You may opt to do allergy tests before doing irritation tests (ie apply for 48 then wait 72-96h to rule out delayed reactions before applying again) if your goal is to minimize the symptoms if you do develop an allergic reaction. If you want to reduce testing time more than to limit potential symptoms, you can just apply the product to your selected area 1-2 times a day for the entirety of the testing period, or until a negative reaction develops.\n* The exact right length to test for negative reactions other than allergic reactions varies from person to person, which is why I say 2-8 weeks, and it's up to you to decide exactly how long is right for you. If you have used products before that did not cause irritation, breakouts etc immediately, but did with continued use (up to 6-8 weeks), then however many weeks it took to see that delayed reaction is likely the right time frame for you to use as a testing window. If you have never experienced a delayed reaction or don't remember how long it took, then you may want to default to the most cautious 8 weeks (the length of a full skin turnover cycle is 6-8 weeks) per testing period until you do have a sense of whether or not a shorter period will work for you. You may want to limit tests that are on areas other than your face to a few days each to balance impatience with precaution, just keep in mind that for your face, the longer timelines are necessary to determine how the product really impacts you. This also varies by product type - if you're testing to see if products like moisturizers irritate or benefit your skin, 2-3 weeks may be sufficient, whereas products with actives that can cause purging (see below) or acclimation periods (see below) could require more than 8 weeks. \n* Purging vs breakouts: if you're testing a product with an active that can cause purging, then breakouts may not actually be negative reactions, so if during testing you do break out, you would still want to continue using it for the full 6-8 weeks to see if the breakouts are related purging (in which case they should clear up after 6-8 weeks) or irritation (still persistent after a full skin turnover cycle). It is important to check if the product you are testing contains any ingredients that could cause purging before you start testing, as this will help you select which steps are worthwhile for you in testing, and to make sense of what you observe as you are using the product. \n* Non-daily treatments: many products contain actives that are too strong to be applied daily or require an acclimation period. I have used 1-2 times daily as the standard application method, but the more important instruction to follow is to mimic the frequency that the product would be applied in your skincare routine. For example, I only apply acids every 3rd day in my normal routine, so if I am testing a new acid product, I will only apply it every 3rd day during the testing period. If you are using a product that requires acclimation, but your current routine for that step includes a product that you have already acclimated to using daily (e.g. if you are using a retinol product that you have already acclimated to using daily, but want to test a higher-potency retinol product), apply your current product at the frequency you have already acclimated to, but apply the new product less frequently if the instructions say to apply less frequently while acclimating - this may mean that the testing period will need to be longer to account for the acclimation period, but is the best way to maintain control conditions for the test.\n* When testing, it is important to always have a control as a basis for comparison - without a control, you won't be able to tell if a negative reaction is due to the product you are testing or to other factors. Irritation can be caused by weather, exposure to external stressors, etc. Breakouts can be hormonal, diet-related, etc. If you jump right to applying a product to your whole face, you won't be able to isolate the effect of the product from the effect of other variables, so you are more likely to make attribution errors when interpreting the effect of a new product. \n\n  \n**Patch Testing Method - Successive Process:**\n\n1. To test for allergic reactions that are the easiest to cover up while healing if they do occur, patch test the product on your forearm. Apply the product to a spot on your forearm, and keep it applied for a minimum of 48h. A single application per day may be enough, but to best mimic your facial skincare routine, re-apply morning and evening. At the end of the 48h, you can wash it off and do not need to apply it again; check it daily for 3-4 more days to make sure that there's no delayed reaction.\n2. The skin on your chest (decolletage) is more like the skin on your face than the skin on your forearm is, so it is possible to catch a negative reaction to a product by patch testing on your chest that might not occur when testing on your forearm, and if you do have a negative reaction, you can keep it covered with clothing while it heals. To do a chest patch test, apply the product you are testing to the same small area on your chest 1-2 times per day (mimic the frequency that it would be applied in your skincare routine) for 2-8 weeks. \n3. The skin behind your ear is more sensitive, and similar to the skin on your face, than the skin on your forearm, so it is possible to catch an allergic reaction to a product by patch testing on behind your ear that might not occur in the forearm allergy test. Apply the product to a spot behind one ear, and keep it applied for a minimum of 48h. A single application per day may be enough, but to best mimic your facial skincare routine, re-apply morning and evening. At the end of the 48h, you can wash it off and do not need to apply it again; check it daily for 3 more days to make sure that there's no delayed reaction.\n4. The skin on your neck is more sensitive than the skin on your chest, so it is possible to catch a negative reaction to a product by patch testing on your neck that might not occur when testing on your chest, and if you do have a negative reaction, it will be less noticeable than a reaction on your face. To do a neck patch test, apply the product you are testing to the same small area on your neck 1-2 times per day (mimic the frequency that it would be applied in your skincare routine) for 2-8 weeks.\n5. If you are specifically concerned about irritation or breakouts, you will need to do some testing on the sensitive/breakout-prone areas of your face to be certain of the impact that it will have. If you think that parts of your face may react differently to products than others, try the strip test. Keep the rest of your skincare routine constant, except for a variation in the step of the product that you are testing. To do the strip test, you apply the product in a straight line down one side of your face using your finger, so that it runs down your forehead, along your cheek and edge of your nose, and down your chin (vary where you place the strip if your sensitive/breakout-prone areas are elsewhere). You can either apply your current product for that step over your whole face and then apply the strip on top, or leave the strip bare when applying your current product and then apply the strip. (Avoid applying the strip before your current product, as it could then be spread to areas outside of the strip). Apply the product you are testing to the same strip 1-2 times per day ((mimic the frequency that it would be applied in your skincare routine) for 2-8 weeks. The strip test will let you see how the different sensitive and/or breakout-prone areas on your face react to the new product, and if a negative reaction does develop, it would be limited to a smaller area. \n6. If you are specifically concerned about irritation or breakouts, you will need to do some testing on the sensitive/breakout-prone areas of your face to be certain of the impact that it will have. If you have a specific area on your face that you are concerned about, you can test the product only on that area on one side of your face - if it does cause a negative reaction, it will be visible, but at least it will be limited to one part of your face. Keep the rest of your skincare routine constant, except for a variation in the step of the product that you are testing. To do a sensitive area test, apply the product you are testing to either a strip down the middle of, or the entirety of, the sensitive area of concern on one side of your face only (apply your current product as usual to the same area on the other side), 1-2 times per day (mimic the frequency that it would be applied in your skincare routine) for 2-8 weeks. \n7. If you want to see how the skin on your face reacts overall to a product, while being able to determine the impact of the new product vs other factors, test the product on one side of your face only. Keep the rest of your skincare routine constant, except for a variation in the step of the product that you are testing. To do the half-face test, apply the product you are testing to one half of your face, and apply the current product to the other side, 1-2 times per day (mimic the frequency that it would be applied in your skincare routine) for 2-8 weeks.

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n¬†\n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n¬†\n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n¬†\n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n¬†\n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n¬†\n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you‚Äôve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you¬†\n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "Hey everyone (Teen F here), I was just wondering if someone could help me figure out why my hair gets so greasy after my sleep? I used to think it was just my pillowcases not being changed often enough but now that I'm changing them about every week, it's still happening. I've noticed that if I take a shower, dry my hair, and then  end up taking a nap, my hair will then become slightly greasier when I wake up. Because of this I have to take my showers in the morning or right before I go anywhere. It could possibly be that I get hot easily in my sleep and sweat alot (hence me having my AC on high at night) or that I don't put my hair in a style or cap before bed, but is there anything else I should know? If it's necessary information, I have more straight hair. It's so straight that people have asked before if I straighten it or if it's just naturally that way. It's also impossible to style and has a lot of frizz no matter what. I like the style I chose for it last time I got a cut: a butterfly cut long layered style with curtain bangs. I don't know how to style the curtain bangs though so I usually just swoop it back every now and then. But back to the main topic, can someone please explain this and help me figure out what stops it?",

      "content": "Hello everyone! I‚Äôm a skincare beginner and I‚Äôm now experiencing huge problems.\nWhen I was a teen, I had acne due to hormonal changes and the persistent use of a mask (COVID-19). At that time, I didn‚Äôt care about it really much, but now I‚Äôm paying the consequences: dehydrated skin, PIE, PIH, a few hormonal pimples, two huge red marks around my nose area, and really sensitive skin. Since I don‚Äôt want to cover my face with foundation or concealer anymore, spending way too much precious time doing my makeup, I started doing my skincare and gave up on makeup.\nHowever, two weeks ago I had a really important event and I decided to put a little bit of foundation all over my face. When I got back home, I took it off with micellar water (from the exact same brand I‚Äôve been using for years) and continued my skincare by washing my face with the Bioderma Sensibio Gel Moussant and by adding the iUnik Centella Calming Gel Cream.\nThe next morning, I woke up, rinsed my face with water only, and applied the Round Lab Birch Juice sunscreen(which I loved). Everything was okay at first, but in a few minutes my skin started becoming red! Since I was already late for work and my skin was not burning at all despite the color, I did not rinse the product, and after an hour I wasn‚Äôt irritated anymore.\nWhen I got back home I realized that my foundation and my powder blush had \"expired\" a month ago, since I had bought them in August 2024. This could probably be the cause of the reaction. However, since the Round Lab Birch Juice Sunscreen burned a little in the days when I was first trying it, and the iUnik Centella Gel Cream gave me some pimples and peeled, I really don‚Äôt know what happened. I stopped doing my skincare and my skin looks better, but I would still like to continue since I want to get rid of all the problems I‚Äôve already talked about. Can someone please explain what happened and give some suggestions? It would be really helpful. Thanks‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",
