      "title": "[Acne] Thought my Accutane journey was over... now my skin looks worse than before",
      "content": "Helllpp pls\nI started Accutane in early March and now it’s October. At first everything was great — my pores and blackheads disappeared, I had some small breakouts but nothing major, and after that my skin looked amazing. But around July things started to get worse again: lots of texture, a lot of inflammation, and honestly my skin now looks even worse than before.\n\nAccording to my dermatologist, my treatment could have ended in July since I barely had any acne left on my face (most of it was on my body). So we began tapering down the dose: first three times a week, then once a week. But that’s when things really got worse. I went back to her, and she said she’s not entirely sure what it could be — it seems like follicular acne, not fungal, because there’s no flaking or signs of a compromised skin barrier. Her advice was to go back on daily Accutane and wait to see how things progress.\n\nShe even told me to buy two more boxes for the next two months. In total i have 2 months and 15 days of medication left. Do you think this will eventually resolve?
