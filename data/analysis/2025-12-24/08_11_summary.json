      "content": "My hair has had so much more actual curl everywhere since I decided to start cupping with a diffuser instead of exclusively hovering the whole time. Now it looks like the hair of an angel!\n\nI'm still having issues though, since the mousse I use requires me to only put in a small amount of it, (lest my hair get weighed the hell down) I end up not being able to actually form a gel cast on my hair. Despite a good chunk of my routine being hover diffusing on low heat.\nI feel like I'm missing out on some definition by not having a gel cast.\n\n\n\nAnother problem is that Im not actually sure how to use hair oil? The benefits of protection from dryness and less moisture loss are super enticing though.\nI just put a bit on the ends of my hair after putting leave in conditioner to hopefully preserve some definition. \n\nBut some people say you're supposed to scrunch out the cast with oil? I can't exactly do that in my situation.\nAnd others say doing this actually evaporates the oil when it comes in contact with the heat of the diffuser. So I'm kind of at an impasse.\n\n\n\nRoutine: After soaking in the shower, spray a bit of Camille rose leave in conditioner and scrunch the ends with a tiny amount of hair oil (not sure if I should use it before or after) \nthen apply Pattern mousse only on the ends and mids so the hair isn't weighed down.\n\nFollowing this, begin hover diffusing on low heat to hopefully make a cast. As well as gently cupping the roots to make some lift.\nThen afterwards, begin hanging head upside down and swaying to all different sides while cupping on medium heat.\n\nEither dry completely or leave semi dry to air dry the rest.",

I’m hoping for some advice because I’m completely clueless when it comes to curly hair. \n\nI have two daughters with curly hair and I’d love to get them haircuts that actually work with their curl patterns rather than against them. I’m not even sure what length to ask for, never mind any extra details, so I’m feeling a bit lost.\n\nI’ve added photos of both of their hair and would really appreciate any opinions based on what you can see - curl type, shape ideas, or anything you think would suit their hair.\n\nMy older daughter (first 2 pics) sits really well for the hairdresser and actually enjoys it, so she’d be fine with something a bit more involved. \n\nMy youngest will be having her first ever haircut, so simple, quick, and low-stress is definitely best for her. She also has a double crown so her hair on top grows in an awkward direction. \n\nI really want to do right by their curls but feel very out of my depth!\n\nHair routine is just child’s farm curly shampoo and conditioner and occasionally their leave-in conditioner too.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Hey gang you know the drill - self-esteem, clothing options, social life &amp; dating life being destroyed by this. 🤕💔\n\nExactly a year ago I had my first cyst on my right collarbone. (Dec 2024)\n\nI am Mediterranean &amp; my skin is crazy prone to pigmentation so even though it was tiny (I honestly thought it was a stubborn single ingrown hair) it looked sooo obvious and dark and wasn’t going away for months 😫😫😫\n\nCos I thought it was a hair I had it lasered and then saw a derm and used a $200 cream (Dermaceutic Mela Cream - a potent, clinical-grade skincare treatment designed to reduce dark spots, melasma, and uneven skin tone). This cream + 2 spot treatments of needling on the mark made it disappear in a few months and I was so relieved for the weird single-cyst era to be over.\n\nWELL I got another one last week on my left collarbone 😫😫 (outlined in blue). Yesterday my derm extracted the build up of oil/keratin/skin cells with a needle extraction) and then this morning I woke up with aNOTHER double cyst 5cm lower on my chest. (Outlined in brown square on photo)\n\nThis is the first time it hurts this much. Just did some warm compresses and have to wait until 2026 for clinics to be open but WHYYYY is this happening?!!!???!\n\nI am incredibly hygienic, ALWAYS shower after exercise (bacne ptsd lol), I use a shower filter, I drink heaps of water, eat organic whole foods only (no processed foods or sugar unless it’s a treat like 4 times a year), I’m not on any medication, I moisture my whole body every night with QV ceramides to keep things moisturised and not blocked so it’s just frustrating to be doing so much and getting cysts that I have never seen before 😣\n\nI’m 34F and wondering if it’s hormonal?😭 this year I started lasering my upper lip so nothing crazy but definitely noticed hair growth more than before 😞.\n\nI also get mild bacne but I am very self conscious and can’t show my back so my whole life I have shown my décolletage as a way of feeling sexy/free/attractive/confident . Not cleavage but just strapless tops, singlet tops and princess cuts etc…\n\nNow this has been taken from me and I am so sad about my wardrobe and also it’s summer here in Aus and now I am avoiding sun exposure for my pigmented skin and it’s just so depressing.\n\nI have always had acne-prone skin but now having to hide my face/back AND NOW CHEST is just super upsetting 😔😔😔\n\nI’m also worried about the costs of extraction. I think my dermal clinician did a good job but I read about making sure the “sac” gets removed and that’s more like a minor incision/surgery by a professional gp/plastic surgeon/dermatologist.\n\nAnyone else dealt with this?? They’re not as hectic as the ones on google images but enough to impact my self esteem and clothing choices.\n\nAnyone gone to a clinic in Melbourne for something like this??",

Instead, it focuses on building a structured skincare routine based on your skin type and goals. The setup walks you through daily and weekly steps, which helped me understand what I should be doing and when, rather than just guessing or changing products often.\n\nFor me, the biggest benefit was consistency. The routine felt simple enough to follow without being overwhelming, and it helped me stay more mindful about my skincare habits. I didn’t notice instant changes, but I did feel clearer about what my routine was meant to achieve over time.\n\nOverall, it seems more suitable for people who want guidance and structure rather than quick results or product recommendations. I thought it might be helpful to share a straightforward experience in case anyone else is researching it.",
