      "content": "My hair has had so much more actual curl everywhere since I decided to start cupping with a diffuser instead of exclusively hovering the whole time. Now it looks like the hair of an angel!\n\nI'm still having issues though, since the mousse I use requires me to only put in a small amount of it, (lest my hair get weighed the hell down) I end up not being able to actually form a gel cast on my hair. Despite a good chunk of my routine being hover diffusing on low heat.\nI feel like I'm missing out on some definition by not having a gel cast.\n\n\n\nAnother problem is that Im not actually sure how to use hair oil? The benefits of protection from dryness and less moisture loss are super enticing though.\nI just put a bit on the ends of my hair after putting leave in conditioner to hopefully preserve some definition. \n\nBut some people say you're supposed to scrunch out the cast with oil? I can't exactly do that in my situation.\nAnd others say doing this actually evaporates the oil when it comes in contact with the heat of the diffuser. So I'm kind of at an impasse.\n\n\n\nRoutine: After soaking in the shower, spray a bit of Camille rose leave in conditioner and scrunch the ends with a tiny amount of hair oil (not sure if I should use it before or after) \nthen apply Pattern mousse only on the ends and mids so the hair isn't weighed down.\n\nFollowing this, begin hover diffusing on low heat to hopefully make a cast. As well as gently cupping the roots to make some lift.\nThen afterwards, begin hanging head upside down and swaying to all different sides while cupping on medium heat.\n\nEither dry completely or leave semi dry to air dry the rest.",

      "content": "Hi! I have been trying to figure out what to do with my sometimes-straight-sometimes-curly hair for years and I feel like I have reached a point where I might go insane soon so here I am desperately asking for some help. \n\nMy hair behaves differently depending on where I am (probably has to do with humidity? dry air = flat and staticky hair). No matter what though, it is always completely flat around the crown of my head. I got deep layers in hopes of getting rid of this issue but surprise: it didn't work. Here is my routine:\n\n1. Wash daily with a sulfate-free shampoo (once a week I do a harsher cleanse with a drugstore shampoo with SLS)\n2. Apply conditioner (right now I'm using the Garnier papaya one but I constantly try different ones)\n3. While my hair is dripping wet I gently rake my fingers into my roots and shake the hair so that it clumps together\n4. Then I flip my hair upside down and scrunch the water out with a microfiber towel\n5. Plop for about 5-10 minutes\n6. Let it air dry\n7. Put it in a pineapple ponytail with a silk scrunchie when I go to bed\n\nI attached pictures of what it looks like in the morning. As you can see I don't use any styling products because my hair is already so thin that it gets weighed down extremely easily. Also since I have to wash my hair daily because of how quickly it gets oily, I would prefer not to have a 10-step routine to follow everyday 😭. But I am open to suggestions! Any tips on what I could improve or change would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

Morning moisturizer, evening moisturizer, special cream for problem areas, drink more water, use a humidifier. This is so much more complicated than I expected.\n\nI’ve been buying all the recommended products, comparing ingredients and prices, even looking at wholesale skincare suppliers on Alibaba because this is getting expensive.

Did not unpack yet.\n\nI have the Curl Girl Nordic Curl Refreshner for the 2, 3, etc day, but it would not do what combing is supposed to do.\n\nMy hair tangles as a sonofabitch.\nWhen I was deep in depression several years ago, I had to cut off my long hair short because it became matted and impossible to comb through.\n\nMy hair also doesn't really look all that curly on third day (like on this photo).\n(Added some \"fresher\" first day/second day after sleeping with wet hair photos for comparison).\n\nIt is currently dyed with henna (impressed how it colored the grey roots). But it kinda looks lifeless as the result.  \n\nI bought a hair mask because my hairdresser recommended it to me (Curl girl Nordic Hair mask protein treatment, was standing for 30 minutes with Chatgpt deciding which mask and line to take) but I don't like applying it since 6 minutes waiting with wet cold hair makes the whole washing the hair procedure even more long and unwanted.\n\nI also bought several untangling brushes.\nAre there any brushes/combs/combing methods acceptable for curly hair on second/third etc day?",

My hairline looks thinner in photos now, which is terrifying at twenty-seven. \nI've tried changing shampoos, eating more protein, even taking vitamins, but nothing seems to help. Last week, my cousin suggested I look into hair growth serums because they worked for her postpartum shedding. She showed me her before-and-after pictures, and honestly, the difference was noticeable. \nNow I'm overwhelmed by options. There are serums with minoxidil, caffeine-based ones, natural oil blends, and products with peptides I can't even pronounce. Some cost fifteen dollars, others cost over a hundred. I browsed through Alibaba and found wholesale options that seemed identical to expensive brand names but I'm skeptical about quality. \nMy question is: do these serums actually work, or is it just marketing? Has anyone experienced real regrowth, or does it just stop further hair loss? I'm willing to commit to a routine if there's genuine evidence, but I don't want to waste money on false promises. Also, how long should I try something before deciding it's not working? ",

Since then I’ve been letting it grow, and this is how it looks now (I blurred my face because I’m 16).\nSome people — especially my family (they’re conservative evangelicals) — say it looks bad and that I should cut it. At school there’s the usual joke that I’m “on bad terms with my barber.”\nI don’t really care that much about what people say, but it still sucks being judged just because of my hair.\nWhat do you think?",
