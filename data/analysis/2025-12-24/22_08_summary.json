      "content": "Started my natural hair texture journey like a month ago. Every day is a different look—volume/definition/softness/shininess—it all differs! I just wanted to share my like day 3-4 hair maybe! I know the curls are not defined on this specific day of my hair wash schedule by any means, and I have not perfected my refresh routine, but I want to say that I really dig voluminous hair looks. I want to look like a 🦁 haha! \n\nRoutine: Wash with Mielle rosemary shampoo and random generic Pantene conditioner. \n\nIn really wet hair, rake either Mixed Chicks Curl Sculptor thinned out with water and Aussie gel on top and scrunch. Try to comb crown of head backwards/horizontally and apply those products and scrunch for more volume. Avoid middle part as much as you can. Then, for this look in particular I guess: mix just a little bit of the The Doux Texture mousse/foam, The Doux Honey mousse/foam, Herbal Essences mousse, John Frieda mousse, and Dollar Tree Spa Luxury extra hold mousse. I mix them all together and rake from roots to end and then diffuse however I want, especially upside down for more volume. \n\nAnd then I actually ended up putting my hair in a curly bun with a side part. And the next day after when I took it down, I retouched/rewet my hair leave in conditioner from Dollar Tree and put some The Doux texture mousse around face framing and Dollar Tree coconut hair oil and CHI hair oil and hairsprayed with some Aussie hair spray for hold!\n\nMedia: 1) Hair down after refresh 2) Curly bun with side part before hair refresh day (ignore crusty ass makeup hehe)",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "Hi! I have been trying to figure out what to do with my sometimes-straight-sometimes-curly hair for years and I feel like I have reached a point where I might go insane soon so here I am desperately asking for some help. \n\nMy hair behaves differently depending on where I am (probably has to do with humidity? dry air = flat and staticky hair). No matter what though, it is always completely flat around the crown of my head. I got deep layers in hopes of getting rid of this issue but surprise: it didn't work. Here is my routine:\n\n1. Wash daily with a sulfate-free shampoo (once a week I do a harsher cleanse with a drugstore shampoo with SLS)\n2. Apply conditioner (right now I'm using the Garnier papaya one but I constantly try different ones)\n3. While my hair is dripping wet I gently rake my fingers into my roots and shake the hair so that it clumps together\n4. Then I flip my hair upside down and scrunch the water out with a microfiber towel\n5. Plop for about 5-10 minutes\n6. Let it air dry\n7. Put it in a pineapple ponytail with a silk scrunchie when I go to bed\n\nI attached pictures of what it looks like in the morning. As you can see I don't use any styling products because my hair is already so thin that it gets weighed down extremely easily. Also since I have to wash my hair daily because of how quickly it gets oily, I would prefer not to have a 10-step routine to follow everyday 😭. But I am open to suggestions! Any tips on what I could improve or change would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry?

For face I use CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser and CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion. I’m terrible at sticking to an actual skincare routine with a bunch of products so I just wash my face in the shower.\n\n(Also my face is red because of the shaving cream I used, not the face wash. I’m also just genetically prone to turning bright red for no reason.)\n\nBesides face and chest acne, I also get really large painful zits on the back of my neck within my hairline. I wash my hair everyday so I don’t think it’s due to dirty hair.\n\nI just feel like I’m so gross looking but I am not an unclean person. Part of me feels like I get oily so fast, another part of me feels like maybe I’m delusional and my skin is actually super dry. I don’t think my skin is sensitive but maybe it is? I’m so out of tune with what is actually going on with my skin I feel so lost.\n\nThis isn’t the worst acne I’ve ever had so maybe I should be thankful. I used to have cystic acne all down my back and legs. But it feels so weird being 23 and none of my peers seem to struggle with this stuff like I do.",

For reference, my hair type: oily scalp, dry ends, I wash daily, and I’m currently growing out old dyed ends.\n\nMy current favourites:\n\nShampoos\n\n1.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Dove Cucumber &amp; Moisture\n2.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Garnier Pure Clean\n3.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Garnier Whole Blends Honey Water (not my main shampoo, but I really liked it when I used it)\n4.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Head &amp; Shoulders Tea Tree\n5.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Pantene Volume (for clarifying)\n\n(I mostly rotate between Dove Cucumber and Garnier Pure Clean for regular washes. I use Head &amp; Shoulders about once a week for scalp health, and Pantene Volume whenever I need a deeper cleanse.)\n\nConditioners / Masks / Bond Repair\n\n1.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Pantene Miracle Rescue Deep Conditioner (main conditioner right now while I grow out the dyed ends)\n2.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Dove Intensive Repair Mask (after Head &amp; Shoulders or clarifying shampoos)\n3.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠OGX Bond Protein Repair Pre-Wash (I use this 2–3 times a month, after shampoo)\n\nLeave-ins\n\n1.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Tresemmé Lamellar Gloss Cream Serum\n2.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Pantene Miracle Rescue Keratin Leave-In Repair Treatment (pump bottle, not the spray)\n3.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠L’Oréal Extraordinary Oil (used after leave-in)\n\n(I use the Tresemmé more often, but both leave-ins are soo good.)\n\nOils\n\nNot drugstore, but oils have helped my hair so much. I use jojoba oil on my ends nightly. On days when I clarify or use Head &amp; Shoulders, I’ll use coconut oil or Vatika oils (argan or black seed) on the ends. For my scalp, I mostly stick to jojoba oil, and I do daily scalp massages too which has helped a lot.\n\nI know this list might seem like a lot to some people, but for me, having these options and rotating them has really helped my hair+scalp, especially since I wash daily while also growing out dyed ends.",

It would clear just to come back.\n\nFinally in December of 2023, my derm put me on spironolactone (50 mg) because topicals (I tried 4 or 5) were not cutting it. \n\nThat really helped!\n\nBut, in June of 2024, my periods started to get very PAINFUL. Lots of pinching feelings. Cramps were an 11 out of 10 and my acne started to ramp up.\n\nMy derm upped my spironolactone to 75mg but my goodness things got even MORE PAINFUL. SO, I went back to 50mg.\n\nThen the acne got SEVERE, no longer mild and able to be treated. \n\nThen! My periods went RAMPANT. \n\nI had my period every weekend. Truly, every week I had a 3 day period for about 4 or 5 months.\n\nSo, I started accutane (hubby has vasectomy and we use condoms, tmi but wanted to add) and a few weeks later my gynecologist prescribed me Slynd to help tame my periods.\n\nAnd then!!! the acne got EVEN WORSE (even on accutane!!!). I was on Slynd for 3 to 4 months.\n\nSo, my PCP said, stop the slynd and get the IUD removed.\n\nSo. Stopped the Slynd in March (and found a new gynecologist) and got the IUD removed in April (2025).\n\nThe accutane FINALLY started to work. \n\nAccept I tried to come off Accutane twice (once in November and once in December), only for the acne to reappear in 6 days. Less than a week. Each time. Acne came back, but not as cystic or big. But the matter is, its back. On my jawline and forehead.\n\nSo, Im on accutane still. After a full year.\n\nAnd Im crushed.\n\nAny thoughts? Advice? Etc?\n\nFurther, I use distilled water and dont eat dairy or high glycemic foods, also to help my skin.\n\nThanks!",

I thought it might be damage from bleaching or heat but I haven’t used bleach in more than a year and I haven’t used heat in months either.\nAs for my routine I use kesh king shampoo, bio soft conditioner and clary hair mask once a week (some of these are local brands so they’re not very known)\nThese are pics of my hair air dried and after brushing it out.\nI tried using a leave in conditioner before and scrunching but the waves fell flat on day 2. \nI’d appreciate any help thank you 🙏 \n",
