      "content": "I fell in love with the Bounce Curl Brush when I purchased it for the almost perfect ringlets it gave me. But over the maybe 3yrs I've been using it, my hair has not grown an inch.\n\nI don't like the hair typing system, but just for reference:\nI have around 3c-4a hair.\nMedium density\nMedium porosity\nMedium strand thickness, although I've found some thicker strands &amp; some thin strands of hair in my head.\nMy hair is all Virgin, no dye or bleach. (Pictures I post with hair color is hair wax, which is an product overlay, not a dye)\n\nWhen I use the brush, I make sure my hair is FULLY DETANGLED with a wide tooth comb &amp; Tangle Teaser before styling with it. I'm positive it's not user error that there's lots of hair stuck on the brush &amp; that my ends are splitting. I find myself having to trim more often than most because my hair starts feeling rough.\n\nI only straighten my hair approximately 1-2xs a year in the Winter because I live in the South. I straightened my hair for my birthday in January &amp; decided since it was straightened, it would be easier to see any damage. I used the search &amp; destroy method to go through as many sections of hair as possible &amp; snip off damage. The amount of single strand knots, split ends, breakage &amp; even keyhole splits I had in my hair was insane.\n\nKeyhole splits in particular, I read, are mostly caused by mechanical damage, i.e. brush styling, high tension, pulling &amp; playing in your hair too much, etc. I'm almost certain most of this damage &amp; the breakage is coming from the Bounce Curl Brush &amp; I'm going to stop using it to see if this is the cause of the breakage. \n\nRoutine &amp; Products:\n\n1) Pre-wash detangle using a wide tooth comb on damp hair &amp; a light leave-in conditioner to provide slip.\n2) Shampoo with Tresemmé Rich Moisture. Clarify 1x a month or as needed with Paul Mitchell's Shampoo 2.\n3) Condition with the Tresemmé Rich Moisture &amp; on Clarify Shampoo days, I use Ouidad's Coil Infusion Triple Threat Deep Conditioner. \n3) On wet hair, I apply Camille Rose's Curl Love Moisture Milk as a leave-in in sections using my fingers.\n3) I section my hair and apply Camille Rose's Spiked Honey Mousse with my fingers. Then I take smaller sections that I want to style, make sure it's fully detangled with a pass through with a Tangle Teaser, then do one pass with the Bounce Curl Brush, using the tension &amp; tilt the brush into the divots as it's supposed to be used.\n4) I scrunch in a little bit of the Ouidad Curl Quencher Gel on styled sections (I didn't care for this too much but I'm trying to get rid of it lol).\n5) Hover-Diffuse blow dry my hair for about 20-30mins. Let the rest air dry.\n6) Scrunch out the crunch &amp; separate curl clumps with Mise En Scene Perfect Serum.\n\nFor bed, I pineapple with a scarf &amp; put on a bonnet.\nIn the mornings, I let my hair get some steam in the shower, take off the bonnet, shake, use a little serum, finger coil a few wonky strands if needed. I wash 1x a week.\n\nTL;DR: I feel like the Bounce Curl Brush's high tension styling causes breakage &amp; other forms of mechanical damage.\n\nWanted to know if anyone else felt the same way!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I feel like my hair is a weakness, and I want to change that 😉\n-----\n\nSo, I cut and style hair for friends and family all the time, but I never figured out my own 😅. Every time I come close, the texture changes…\n\nFor most of my life, I had wavy hair. But the older I get, the curlier it becomes, and recently the change has been particularly noticeable. I’m actually excited about it — I love textured hair — but I’m completely lost right now.\n\n**About my hair:**\n\n• I think I have low density, coarse hair\n\n• I have a large, square forehead, which makes it hard to get a full-looking fringe. \n\n• My front section grows in the opposite direction -- *when I get a buzz cut there's a clear V-shape above my hairline where the hair changes direction*\n\nBecause of this, my hair naturally wants to stand up on top of my head, and I have to get it wet every morning to lay it back down. \n\nAs a teenager, when my hair was straighter, I would wake up looking like Syndrome from The Incredibles (included last picture just for fun😂).\n\nNow that it’s more curly, some days it’s giving Bob Dylan, some days Edward Scissorhands… and very rarely, it’ll look acceptable and I won’t touch it (picture 1 and 2 was one of those days.) *Still very messy, and the fringe is looking boneless 😬.*\n\n**Routine/Styling:**\n\nI’ve been meaning to grow my hair out a little — I think it would balance out my strong bone structure in a nice way — but every time it gets longer, I struggle. So for now, I just keep it short and style it like when it was straighter.\n\n• I wash it about 3 times a week\n\n• I use a mask. *currently, no conditioner*\n\n• When it’s wet, I lay it down and arrange it so it air dries nicely. For hold I either use matte paste when wet, or iI'll use powder later when it's dry. *At this point, it looks very flat and thin (picture 3,4 and 5)*\n\n• Once it’s dry, I rearrange it — with or without powder on my fingers (separate the strands, lift up the roots, etc.) *I add hairspray on windy days.*\n\n*I have no specific sleeping routine and I just refresh with water without adding products.* (Styled hair on picture 6,7 and 8)\n\nIt works for now, but I don’t actually love this flat hairstyle on me — somedays I feel like a playmobile and honestly, styling my hair is the worst part of my mornings…\n\nIn the past, I did try defining the curls with leave-ins or gel (although it’s been over a year, so it might look different now with tighter curls?) and it would always look weighed down and boneless, with my scalp showing — even with the smallest amount of product. Maybe my hair is just too thin to be in clumps 🤷🏻‍♂️.\n\n**Product list :**\n\nShampoo - Pantene (volume line)\n\nMask - Garnier Fructis (currently, the banana superfood one)\n\nMatte paste - Taft (molding styling clay)\n\nStyling powder and hairspray - Taft (volume line)\n\n-----\n\nOkay, that was all the important details, I think.\n\nSo basically, my goal is to get a longer, more free/natural-looking hairstyle, that compliments my texture. I would like to retain volume without losing coverage on my forehead. And if it could be low maintenance too, at least in the morning, that would be life-changing 😩.\n\nThanks for reading!",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Postpartum Skin - acne, dryness, irritation, EVERYTHING!",
      "content": "I’m a new mom of a 2 month old and on top of all things postpartum, and about 2 weeks ago, my skin completely changed overnight! Some background - I’ve always had consistently clear skin, with the occasional pimple here or there, so I’ve never had to deviate from my routine or deal with any major skin concerns. My skin was typically combo where it was dry in winter months (hydration heavy routine) and oily in the summer months.\n\nNow overnight, I developed major acne. My entire face is covered in, what looks to be hormonal acne (?) with a few pus-filled pimples. As a result of this, my face is so itchy, and the skin is peeling/shedding! Any product I put on it, feels like it’s burning my face. My face is so dry, red, itchy, and irritated all the time. \n\nHere’s what I did: \n\nFirst, I thought the problem was acne so I changed my routine to be acne focused: \n\n\\- cleanse with CeraVe Salicylic Acid cleanser \n\n\\- tone with MediHeal tea tree toner pads \n\n\\- The Ordinary salicylic acid serum \n\n\\- moisturizer with The Body Shop tea tree moisturizer\n\n\\- mediheal tree tree sheet mask \n\nThen that made it worse because that’s when the peeling/irritation/dryness happened, so now I’m focusing on heavy hydration: \n\n\\- cleanse with Round Lab Birch Moisturizing Cleanser \n\n\\- tone with Paula’s Choice Advanced Replenishing Toner\n\n\\- Torriden Dive In HA serum \n\n\\- CeraVe moisturizing cream (large tub) \n\nI think the peeling has reduced but I feel like I’m at a standstill because while this addresses one problem (dryness and peeling), I feel that it’s not addressing the other (acne and irritation). Also, the hydration routine still makes my face burn. \n\nIn addition, I incorporate the following: \n\n\\- spray my face with Hypoclorous Acid spray after cleansing in the AM and PM \n\n\\- use witch hazel to tone my face with a cotton pad that also “rubs away” the dead peeled off skin \n\n\\- incorporated hygienic facial towels\n\n\\- drinking SO much water \n\n\\- avoiding any products with AHA/BHA - even though I feel that the exfoliation would help with the peeling, but would not help with the acne/skin barrier issue\n\nThings I’ve tried, but didn’t help: \n\n\\- tried to combine various products that address acne + hydration (hydration cleanse + SA serum + hydration toner + tea tree mask + hydration cream) \n\n\\- using Vaseline + aquaphor to help with healing skin \n\n\\- tried baby balm to see if it would help the soothing (my thinking was that if it was gentle enough for the baby, it would be fine for me - lol it was not) \n\nI’ve been told that this is just “hormonal acne or postpartum skin” that eventually goes away but I can’t sit around while my face is so irritated from the acne, peeling, burning and itching. On top of everything else post partum, I feel like my confidence has taken a major dive. \n\nPlease help with my routine modifications, product suggestions, or tips and tricks on dealing with all of these issues at once.

Read the [beginner's guide](https://tressless.com/learn/beginners-guide)\n2. Read the [\"learn\" section](https://tressless.com/learn) section with different treatments\n3. [use search](https://tressless.com/search) *before* asking any questions.\n4. [Chat with the TresslessGPT bot](https://tressless.com/chat) to ask any questions about treatment or their hairline, it's free for everyone now.\n\n## Ready to start treating?\n\n1.

      "content": "Hi! I am a hair stylist and have my b.s in biochemistry. I am wondering if anyone can explain to me scientifically the discussion and recommendation of not washing the hair until 48-72 hours after a color service due to the cuticle not being “completely closed”. I know cuticles dont work like blinds that just open and close. In my experience, washing 24 hours after color shouldn’t affect the longevity because the color doesn’t continue processing &amp; the conditioner seals with an acidic pH. I’m confusedddd",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am really confused about my situation and would appreciate any advice and help in the matter. I started noticing thinning around Oct 2024, had super thick hair before that (had to get it thinned out to be manageable). I went to a dermatologist and he told me to start using topical minoxidil, he said it could be MPB or TE, TE because I was stressed in school due to med school applications, mcat etc and also because I was Vit D deficient. I did not start topical min until June 2025 and experiences a crazy shed but stopped using min in August because it made my hair super greasy and I had to shampoo almost everyday (didn't get a shed while stopping). I also got my serum DHT tested and it was way above the normal range (1099 pg/ml, range is until 850), my dad and his brother are kinda bald but my mom's brother has really thick hair well into his 30s. I also started going to the gym in the summer of 2023, started creatine, so that might have also increased my DHT and might have caused mpb.\n\nSo, i went back the dermatologist who told me to start finasteride if I wanted, I didn't understand it, I might have prompted him to come to that conclusion, he didn't really inspect my situation. Before starting finasteride, I went to another dermatologist who examined my scalp and said it is Telogen Effluvium and not MPB (don't know who to trust at this point), and prescribed me oral minoxidil (I told him this after he gave me several options)\n\nSo, here I am with both oral fin and oral min from two different providers who have two different diagnosis (the first one didn't even give me a diagnosis but given he gave me fin, I am assuming he thinks it is a combo of TE/MPB)\n\n\\- Also stopped creatine (been 2 months)\n\n\\-Hair changed from straight to wavy/curly within this span, don't know why\n\n\\-Hairfall has stabilized though, not shedding at this point, I just don't know if I will regain my prior density\n\n\\-Have baby hair around the temples, not sure if these will grow terminal\n\nBelow are photos for reference\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzch36sbzsgg1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=961f9e4f8dfc0e1bd8d396fda8b3bffa5cf79ee0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhynb5sbzsgg1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f289954162c31f25e1c11e9676694486bdf7906\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4gyt5sbzsgg1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36eaee4ccd3a48874dbe27b2e865dd4165a3f503\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujiy25sbzsgg1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b96eabaa84a4c525023a9a669b0cce531a490ae\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbo9r7sbzsgg1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2de0e377c1993fc6170892de7b86808ae0f5b5f0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0kgodcsbzsgg1.jpg?width=1348&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a6393c532d7de0574f96576629e17a6172557a\n\n",
