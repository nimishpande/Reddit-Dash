If I’m going somewhere and not at home that’s when I brush my hair with a wet brush and then wet it and add the product and just squish it. \n\n1-2: the first two pictures are when I thought I had wavy hair, I did not put any product or style it at all, I would just brush and go\n\n3:the third photo is no product, not brushed just air dried \n\nThe rest: Either styled or in between wash days and with different hair cuts :) \n\nany suggestions would be VERY appreciated!

      "content": "*Sorry for the long text and all the pictures. It’s my first time on this sub, so I hope it’s okay here. (Please bear with me, English is my second language🙏🏻.)*\n\n**Quick summary :**\n\nBasically, I would love to achieve a slightly longer hairstyle and be able to retain volume without losing coverage on my forehead. As explained below, I struggle with my texture, so any suggestion/advice/opinion would help (haircut, products, knowledge...) I feel like my hair is a weakness, and I want to change that 😉\n-----\n\nSo, I cut and style hair for friends and family all the time, but I never figured out my own 😅. Every time I come close, the texture changes…\n\nFor most of my life, I had wavy hair. But the older I get, the curlier it becomes, and recently the change has been particularly noticeable. I’m actually excited about it — I love textured hair — but I’m completely lost right now.\n\n**About my hair:**\n\n• I think I have low density, coarse hair\n\n• I have a large, square forehead, which makes it hard to get a full-looking fringe. \n\n• My front section grows in the opposite direction -- *when I get a buzz cut there's a clear V-shape above my hairline where the hair changes direction*\n\nBecause of this, my hair naturally wants to stand up on top of my head, and I have to get it wet every morning to lay it back down. \n\nAs a teenager, when my hair was straighter, I would wake up looking like Syndrome from The Incredibles (included last picture just for fun😂).\n\nNow that it’s more curly, some days it’s giving Bob Dylan, some days Edward Scissorhands… and very rarely, it’ll look acceptable and I won’t touch it (picture 1 and 2 was one of those days.) *Still very messy, and the fringe is looking boneless 😬.*\n\n**Routine/Styling:**\n\nI’ve been meaning to grow my hair out a little — I think it would balance out my strong bone structure in a nice way — but every time it gets longer, I struggle. So for now, I just keep it short and style it like when it was straighter.\n\n• I wash it about 3 times a week\n\n• I use a mask. *currently, no conditioner*\n\n• When it’s wet, I lay it down and arrange it so it air dries nicely. For hold I either use matte paste when wet, or iI'll use powder later when it's dry. *At this point, it looks very flat and thin (picture 3,4 and 5)*\n\n• Once it’s dry, I rearrange it — with or without powder on my fingers (separate the strands, lift up the roots, etc.) *I add hairspray on windy days.*\n\n*I have no specific sleeping routine and I just refresh with water without adding products.* (Styled hair on picture 6,7 and 8)\n\nIt works for now, but I don’t actually love this flat hairstyle on me — somedays I feel like a playmobile and honestly, styling my hair is the worst part of my mornings…\n\nIn the past, I did try defining the curls with leave-ins or gel (although it’s been over a year, so it might look different now with tighter curls?) and it would always look weighed down and boneless, with my scalp showing — even with the smallest amount of product. Maybe my hair is just too thin to be in clumps 🤷🏻‍♂️.\n\n**Product list :**\n\nShampoo - Pantene (volume line)\n\nMask - Garnier Fructis (currently, the banana superfood one)\n\nMatte paste - Taft (molding styling clay)\n\nStyling powder and hairspray - Taft (volume line)\n\n-----\n\nOkay, that was all the important details, I think.\n\nSo basically, my goal is to get a longer, more free/natural-looking hairstyle, that compliments my texture. I would like to retain volume without losing coverage on my forehead. And if it could be low maintenance too, at least in the morning, that would be life-changing 😩.\n\nThanks for reading!",

Decided to try a curly routine with mousse and diffusing and it went really wrong!\n\nOn damp/wet hair I put a handful of mousse and rubbed it all through my hair from ends to roots and combed my hair. I then thought it looked too stringy so I put some more mousse in my hairs and scrunched the mousse into the ends. I then diffused for about 30 mins. After diffusing I scrunched out the crunch for about 10 mins with 5 drops of the oil in my hands. \n\nMy thoughts: it looked too stringy when the mousse was in so this is obviously part of the issue, should I try twisting my hair into thicker clumps? Also wondering if I used too much mousse or should never have combed it after the mouse was in? Any advice very appreciated. I have quite thin, fine hair. \n\n* Products used: \n- 'Cake' curly shampoo and conditioner. \n- 'Cake' mousse \n- Few drops of Opalex no 7 bonding oil ",

Like… how do I tell if my skin is oily, dry, or whatever? \n\nI’m just looking for:\n\nA simple, basic skincare routine\n\nAffordable/budget-friendly products\n\nBeginner-friendly advice (nothing complicated pls)\n\nProduct suggestions that won’t destroy my wallet\n\nWhat I actually need vs what I can skip\n\nRight now I don’t really use anything except water and soap😬. I just want something realistic I can stick to as a broke college guy and slowly improve my skin.\n\nAny guidance, routines, or product recs would help a lot. Thanks in advance 🙏",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I purchased the products she told me worked best for finer, wavy hair: ouidad climate control shampoo and conditioner, mizani miracle milk, ouidad volumizing mousse, biolage gelee, ouidad hold spray , and a lightweight oil of my choosing. She told me not to use curl cream bc it was too heavy. While the waves are certainly more defined than they were, I’m still underwhelmed with the results. Even in breaking the cast, my hair feels rough and rigid. Is it possible for me to have fluffier(??) waves? When I look at myself in the mirror it just looks crispy.\n\nRoutine: (using products listed above)\n\nShower: Maui cleansing shampoo, ouidad shampoo and conditioner\n\nI style my hair sopping wet, out of the shower and in sections with a curl bounce brush. \n\nMiracle milk leave in conditioner\n\nMousse\n\nGel\n\nHold spray\n\nI micro plop in a satin towel and then halo + scrunch diffuse until dry. \n\nOnce dry I break the cast with oua lightweight oil\n\nAm I being too picky?

      "content": "Hey Folks,\n\n  \nLooking for some help with finding the right moisturizer with Tazarotene Gel 0.1%.   \nI have oily, acne prone skin, and have been using Taz Gel for a while now with great results.\n\nThe problem I have is which moisturizer to use because the ones that I have tried, and the ones that work have up to three major issues. Either they are   \n  \nI) not moisturizing enough and leave skin raw/sensitive/burning  \nII) they are too heavy and cause breakouts  \nIII) Gel Moisturizer on Gel Cream leaves the skin wet/sticky/greasy for hours after applying. \n\n  \nMy general routine is Apply Taz at night before bed, and put a moisturizer almost immediately on top of it afterwards. Moisturizers I have used:\n\n**Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** \\- This is the kind of the holy grail for me in terms of moisturizing. Absolutely no redness/irritation/sensitivity after using this and it keeps the skin super moisturized. But the biggest issue here is this causes closed comedones / white heads / acne breakouts. I tried it twice a few months apart just to make sure, and it still results the same breakouts.\n\n**Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel** \\- This is the closest I have gotten to a moisturizer that somewhat keeps the redness away but this is a gel, and applying it on top of Taz Gel leaves my skin wet/greasy/sticky for hours. Currently working with this. Most effective after Illiyoon gel, very minor redness left to deal with but the greasiness is extremely hard to handle.\n\n**ETUDE SoonJung Hydro Barrier Cream** (Gel Cream Version) - This one kind of work, but same issue as the Illiyoon Gel, takes hours to dry and in my opinion is slightly less effective than the Illiyoon Gel.\n\n**ANUA Rice 70 Intensive Moisturizing Milk** \\- Used as a morning lotion to help reduce redness with less effective primary moisturizers. Quick to dry, and provides low moisture.\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors** \\- Can't remember since it was a while back but either it was not effective for me or caused breakouts\n\n**La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ Triple Repair Moisturizing Cream** \\- To be fair, I didn't give this too much time to test, the pump was so bad and broken I couldn't use it properly for long. Wasn't too effective for the day or three I tried it though.\n\n**PURITO Mighty Bamboo** \\- Left my skin burning, not sure if it was due to the ingredients or because it was ineffective at repairing the skin barrier\n\n**Vanicream** \\- This worked initially, but is ineffective with Taz, and leaves the skin burning since its not able to moisturize enough / repair the barrier enough.\n\n  \nI might have missed one or two more but those are the major ones I have tried. \n\nI am looking for a single moisturizer I can use with Taz 0.1% gel, that is probably a lighter weight cream or lotion I suppose so it doesn't leave my greasy for hours, and keeps the barrier solid and skin healthy and pain free. \n\nI know people suggest buffering the Moisturizer first or layering with additional products, but I find that a hassle. I find myself to be a lot more compliant/consistent with just the two products than if I have to use more. \n\nCurrent products I am considering but extremely open to recommendations outside these as well. Thank You in advance:\n\n1) Illiyoon Lotion (Some reports that lotion causes same problems as cream?)  \n2) ETude SoonJung Rich Cream or Light Weight Cream (non gel version, some reports that reformulation is irritating or causes similar issue as closed pores/comedones/white heads)  \n3) Aestrua ATOBARRIER365 Cream or Lotion (Twice as Expensive as most other options, so hesitant to make it the primary if it works but willing to go this route if no other options)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am really confused about my situation and would appreciate any advice and help in the matter. I started noticing thinning around Oct 2024, had super thick hair before that (had to get it thinned out to be manageable). I went to a dermatologist and he told me to start using topical minoxidil, he said it could be MPB or TE, TE because I was stressed in school due to med school applications, mcat etc and also because I was Vit D deficient. I did not start topical min until June 2025 and experiences a crazy shed but stopped using min in August because it made my hair super greasy and I had to shampoo almost everyday (didn't get a shed while stopping). I also got my serum DHT tested and it was way above the normal range (1099 pg/ml, range is until 850), my dad and his brother are kinda bald but my mom's brother has really thick hair well into his 30s. I also started going to the gym in the summer of 2023, started creatine, so that might have also increased my DHT and might have caused mpb.\n\nSo, i went back the dermatologist who told me to start finasteride if I wanted, I didn't understand it, I might have prompted him to come to that conclusion, he didn't really inspect my situation. Before starting finasteride, I went to another dermatologist who examined my scalp and said it is Telogen Effluvium and not MPB (don't know who to trust at this point), and prescribed me oral minoxidil (I told him this after he gave me several options)\n\nSo, here I am with both oral fin and oral min from two different providers who have two different diagnosis (the first one didn't even give me a diagnosis but given he gave me fin, I am assuming he thinks it is a combo of TE/MPB)\n\n\\- Also stopped creatine (been 2 months)\n\n\\-Hair changed from straight to wavy/curly within this span, don't know why\n\n\\-Hairfall has stabilized though, not shedding at this point, I just don't know if I will regain my prior density\n\n\\-Have baby hair around the temples, not sure if these will grow terminal\n\nBelow are photos for reference\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzch36sbzsgg1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=961f9e4f8dfc0e1bd8d396fda8b3bffa5cf79ee0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhynb5sbzsgg1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f289954162c31f25e1c11e9676694486bdf7906\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4gyt5sbzsgg1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36eaee4ccd3a48874dbe27b2e865dd4165a3f503\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujiy25sbzsgg1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b96eabaa84a4c525023a9a669b0cce531a490ae\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbo9r7sbzsgg1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2de0e377c1993fc6170892de7b86808ae0f5b5f0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0kgodcsbzsgg1.jpg?width=1348&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a6393c532d7de0574f96576629e17a6172557a\n\n",

      "content": "Hi all! As the title suggests, I’m new to skincare and there’s a lot of things I’m unsure of, so I joined this sub to learn more!\n\nSome basic info about my skin is that it is very sensitive, I try to use gentle cleansers/products but my face always ends up red, particularly around my cheeks.\n\nThe most acne-prone parts of my skin are my chin, the area under my cheekbones (I’m not sure what that’s called), and my forehead.\n\nAnyways, here are some of my main questions involving skincare:\n\n1.\t⁠When should you see a dermatologist?\n\nAs I mentioned before, I have super sensitive skin and I’m wondering if it’s necessary to see a professional due to the amount of products I’ve found that irritates my skin.\n\n2. How often should you moisturize?\n\nI believe twice a day is recommended, but I want to see what others have to say!\n\n3. What ingredients should you absolutely avoid?\n\nI know there are so ingredients that are worse than others in regard to clogging pores, irritation, etc., but I’m not sure what exactly.\n\n4. At what point in your skincare routine should you use spot treatment?\n\nOver the past few days the basic routine I’ve been doing is cleanse/wash, spot treatment, then moisturizer, but I’m not sure if that’s sufficient.\n\n5. Is popping pimples actually that bad for your skin?\n\nI’ve heard that popping pimples can cause scarring and spread bacteria more, but for me, sometimes it’s more efficient than using pimple patches. I think it’s the technique that matters, but I’m not sure whether or not it’s something to completely avoid or not.\n\nThose are my top questions! Thank you to whomever took the time to read!\n\nP.S. This is my first post, so I hope I followed all of the rules accordingly, also I wasn’t sure if there was a more fitting tag to use besides miscellaneous, so I hope it’s okay I used it.",
