I do this on soaking wet hair because it tends to bring out the best results. I then scrunch my heart out (first with bare hands, then into an old tshirt) spray on some heat protection (Elvital - Defeat The Heat spray) and diffuse on medium heat, medium speed.\nLastly I scrunch out the remaining gel cast with the Pantene Pro-V Argan Infused Oil.\nI sleep with my hair up in a bun on a satin pillowcase.

I want to take steps to ensure the piercing doesn’t get infected. I was told by them to put vaseline on the holes twice a day to take care of it but I’ve read posts on reddit saying that it actually traps bacteria.\n\nI read that saline water can be used twice a day to keep it clean. Do you guys have any recommendations for saline water? Some brands like H20, recovery, Neilmed etc seem good but they’re super expensive. I just want something good below 500 rupees, if possible.\n\nAlso, since getting it delivered online may take time, what can I do to take care of it for a few days until it comes?\n\nAny other suggested precautions would also be appreciated.

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I've had blond foils mixed with my natural hair colour for the last couple of years as I was told this was the best way to cover it, and although the hairdressers did a good job, I personally hate being blond. In my past I've gone dark brown, pink, blue, purple. I'd love to go dark brown again. What's my best/ least maintenance option? Full head colour and keep doing the roots every 6 weeks (or less?), would brown foils help or not hide greys at all?  Can i mix brown and blond to hide the greys but have it mostly dark or does this look bad? Also I'm only grey at the front along the scalp, nothing at the back yet.\n\nI'm really lazy with my hair, it's straight thick medium brown, I wash brush and let it dry naturally, I don't do any styling and go to the hairdressers on average once per year, but will make an effort to go more often to do roots if i can have dark hair!",

      "content": "*Sorry for the long text and all the pictures. It’s my first time on this sub, so I hope it’s okay here. (Please bear with me, English is my second language🙏🏻.)*\n\n**Quick summary :**\n\nBasically, I would love to achieve a slightly longer hairstyle and be able to retain volume without losing coverage on my forehead. As explained below, I struggle with my texture, so any suggestion/advice/opinion would help (haircut, products, knowledge...) I feel like my hair is a weakness, and I want to change that 😉\n-----\n\nSo, I cut and style hair for friends and family all the time, but I never figured out my own 😅. Every time I come close, the texture changes…\n\nFor most of my life, I had wavy hair. But the older I get, the curlier it becomes, and recently the change has been particularly noticeable. I’m actually excited about it — I love textured hair — but I’m completely lost right now.\n\n**About my hair:**\n\n• I think I have low density, coarse hair\n\n• I have a large, square forehead, which makes it hard to get a full-looking fringe. \n\n• My front section grows in the opposite direction -- *when I get a buzz cut there's a clear V-shape above my hairline where the hair changes direction*\n\nBecause of this, my hair naturally wants to stand up on top of my head, and I have to get it wet every morning to lay it back down. \n\nAs a teenager, when my hair was straighter, I would wake up looking like Syndrome from The Incredibles (included last picture just for fun😂).\n\nNow that it’s more curly, some days it’s giving Bob Dylan, some days Edward Scissorhands… and very rarely, it’ll look acceptable and I won’t touch it (picture 1 and 2 was one of those days.) *Still very messy, and the fringe is looking boneless 😬.*\n\n**Routine/Styling:**\n\nI’ve been meaning to grow my hair out a little — I think it would balance out my strong bone structure in a nice way — but every time it gets longer, I struggle. So for now, I just keep it short and style it like when it was straighter.\n\n• I wash it about 3 times a week\n\n• I use a mask. *currently, no conditioner*\n\n• When it’s wet, I lay it down and arrange it so it air dries nicely. For hold I either use matte paste when wet, or iI'll use powder later when it's dry. *At this point, it looks very flat and thin (picture 3,4 and 5)*\n\n• Once it’s dry, I rearrange it — with or without powder on my fingers (separate the strands, lift up the roots, etc.) *I add hairspray on windy days.*\n\n*I have no specific sleeping routine and I just refresh with water without adding products.* (Styled hair on picture 6,7 and 8)\n\nIt works for now, but I don’t actually love this flat hairstyle on me — somedays I feel like a playmobile and honestly, styling my hair is the worst part of my mornings…\n\nIn the past, I did try defining the curls with leave-ins or gel (although it’s been over a year, so it might look different now with tighter curls?) and it would always look weighed down and boneless, with my scalp showing — even with the smallest amount of product. Maybe my hair is just too thin to be in clumps 🤷🏻‍♂️.\n\n**Product list :**\n\nShampoo - Pantene (volume line)\n\nMask - Garnier Fructis (currently, the banana superfood one)\n\nMatte paste - Taft (molding styling clay)\n\nStyling powder and hairspray - Taft (volume line)\n\n-----\n\nOkay, that was all the important details, I think.\n\nSo basically, my goal is to get a longer, more free/natural-looking hairstyle, that compliments my texture. I would like to retain volume without losing coverage on my forehead. And if it could be low maintenance too, at least in the morning, that would be life-changing 😩.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I’m so confused as to what my curl pattern is, what routine would suit my hair, products etc so anything would help (\\^.\\^) I think my hair is fine and thin? \n\n  \nMy current routine: \n\nMy shampoo is original Ivory Bar soap 💀, I don’t use conditioner, and I only use 1 product Aussie Miracle Curls Leave in Detangling milk (I’m open to suggestions) I usually just use the bar soap, then I put it up in a wrap with a microfiber hair towel. then I take it out of the towel and let it air dry and then sleep. If I’m going somewhere and not at home that’s when I brush my hair with a wet brush and then wet it and add the product and just squish it. \n\n1-2: the first two pictures are when I thought I had wavy hair, I did not put any product or style it at all, I would just brush and go\n\n3:the third photo is no product, not brushed just air dried \n\nThe rest: Either styled or in between wash days and with different hair cuts :) \n\nany suggestions would be VERY appreciated!

Decided to try a curly routine with mousse and diffusing and it went really wrong!\n\nOn damp/wet hair I put a handful of mousse and rubbed it all through my hair from ends to roots and combed my hair. I then thought it looked too stringy so I put some more mousse in my hairs and scrunched the mousse into the ends. I then diffused for about 30 mins. After diffusing I scrunched out the crunch for about 10 mins with 5 drops of the oil in my hands. \n\nMy thoughts: it looked too stringy when the mousse was in so this is obviously part of the issue, should I try twisting my hair into thicker clumps? Also wondering if I used too much mousse or should never have combed it after the mouse was in? Any advice very appreciated. I have quite thin, fine hair. \n\n* Products used: \n- 'Cake' curly shampoo and conditioner. \n- 'Cake' mousse \n- Few drops of Opalex no 7 bonding oil ",

      "title": "[Routine Help] Postpartum Skin - acne, dryness, irritation, EVERYTHING!",
      "content": "I’m a new mom of a 2 month old and on top of all things postpartum, and about 2 weeks ago, my skin completely changed overnight! Some background - I’ve always had consistently clear skin, with the occasional pimple here or there, so I’ve never had to deviate from my routine or deal with any major skin concerns. My skin was typically combo where it was dry in winter months (hydration heavy routine) and oily in the summer months.\n\nNow overnight, I developed major acne. My entire face is covered in, what looks to be hormonal acne (?) with a few pus-filled pimples. As a result of this, my face is so itchy, and the skin is peeling/shedding! Any product I put on it, feels like it’s burning my face. My face is so dry, red, itchy, and irritated all the time. \n\nHere’s what I did: \n\nFirst, I thought the problem was acne so I changed my routine to be acne focused: \n\n\\- cleanse with CeraVe Salicylic Acid cleanser \n\n\\- tone with MediHeal tea tree toner pads \n\n\\- The Ordinary salicylic acid serum \n\n\\- moisturizer with The Body Shop tea tree moisturizer\n\n\\- mediheal tree tree sheet mask \n\nThen that made it worse because that’s when the peeling/irritation/dryness happened, so now I’m focusing on heavy hydration: \n\n\\- cleanse with Round Lab Birch Moisturizing Cleanser \n\n\\- tone with Paula’s Choice Advanced Replenishing Toner\n\n\\- Torriden Dive In HA serum \n\n\\- CeraVe moisturizing cream (large tub) \n\nI think the peeling has reduced but I feel like I’m at a standstill because while this addresses one problem (dryness and peeling), I feel that it’s not addressing the other (acne and irritation). Also, the hydration routine still makes my face burn. \n\nIn addition, I incorporate the following: \n\n\\- spray my face with Hypoclorous Acid spray after cleansing in the AM and PM \n\n\\- use witch hazel to tone my face with a cotton pad that also “rubs away” the dead peeled off skin \n\n\\- incorporated hygienic facial towels\n\n\\- drinking SO much water \n\n\\- avoiding any products with AHA/BHA - even though I feel that the exfoliation would help with the peeling, but would not help with the acne/skin barrier issue\n\nThings I’ve tried, but didn’t help: \n\n\\- tried to combine various products that address acne + hydration (hydration cleanse + SA serum + hydration toner + tea tree mask + hydration cream) \n\n\\- using Vaseline + aquaphor to help with healing skin \n\n\\- tried baby balm to see if it would help the soothing (my thinking was that if it was gentle enough for the baby, it would be fine for me - lol it was not) \n\nI’ve been told that this is just “hormonal acne or postpartum skin” that eventually goes away but I can’t sit around while my face is so irritated from the acne, peeling, burning and itching. On top of everything else post partum, I feel like my confidence has taken a major dive. \n\nPlease help with my routine modifications, product suggestions, or tips and tricks on dealing with all of these issues at once.

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for some advice and personal experiences. I was recently traveling for a long time and hit a \"perfect storm\" of travel stress and environmental changes that caused the worst stubborn acne breakout of my life. Because I was on the move, I couldn’t start any professional treatments at the time.\n\nNow that I’m back, my active acne has finally healed, but I’m left with dark spots, a broken skin barrier, and one very deep, pitted cyst scar with wall on my cheek that is my main concern.\n\nI visited a dermatologist, and she gave me these options:\n\nDermapen (Microneedling) + Exosomes (She recommended this as the \"best\" for my current state).\n\nFractional CO2 Laser.\n\nDermaroller (though I’ve heard mixed things about this for deep scars).\n\nShe also suggested regular chemical peels in between sessions. I had my first Salicylic Acid peel yesterday, and my skin is currently feeling very irritated and sensitive.\n\nMy Big Concern:\n\nWhile researching, I learned that if a scar is \"tethered\" (pulled down by internal fibers), surface treatments like lasers or needles won't lift it unless those fibers are cut first via Subcision. My doctor didn't mention this, and I’m worried about spending money on Dermapen if the scar is held down from below.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on:\n\nIf you had deep scars after a breakout, did Dermapen + Exosomes actually work, or did you have to do Subcision first?\n\nHow did you handle chemical peels while your skin barrier was still healing?\n\nFor those who did Exosomes, was the extra cost worth it for the healing speed and barrier repair?\n\nI’m nervous because this is my first time doing \"whole face\" treatments and the online reviews are so conflicting. Any guidance would be huge. Thanks!",

Some people have naturally thin hair.\n\nIt's vital to take identical photos every few months. Remember that [consistent lighting is extremely important](/r/tressless/comments/fxb0xn).\n\nAge and family history are worth mentioning.\n\n## Just starting out?\n\n1. Read the [beginner's guide](https://tressless.com/learn/beginners-guide)\n2. Read the [\"learn\" section](https://tressless.com/learn) section with different treatments\n3. [use search](https://tressless.com/search) *before* asking any questions.\n4. [Chat with the TresslessGPT bot](https://tressless.com/chat) to ask any questions about treatment or their hairline, it's free for everyone now.\n\n## Ready to start treating?\n\n1. Talk to a doctor\n2. [Find products in your area](https://tressless.com/products)\n3. then [start a journal on community.tressless.com](https://tressless.com/start-journal), and update every couple of months.\n\nYou might not get an answer if your question is too basic or common, because treatment is the same for almost everyone. Nobody can predict if a treatment will work for you.\n\nThis is a community, and you can help out fellow members by commenting under their photos and upvoting people that leave you comments.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to achieve that nice swoop in the bang and have it stay for the whole day like when I got the cut. It also doesn't help that I have very fine hair 😞 I envy people with thick hair. I really like the hairstyle and wish to maintain it. I have hair rollers, a round brush, a concentrator nozzle (idk if this one actually helps at all), and some hairspray if that helps with any ideas. \n\nAny advice is appreciated!!
