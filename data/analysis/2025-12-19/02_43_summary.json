I know its not some crazy transformation but i'm satisfied with my current hair density and thinkness, and everyone i know who used to say \"hey dude i think you are balding\" \" you gotta do something about it, your sculp is very visible\" are now making remarks on how much my hair has improved. I'm sorry about the quality of the pictures, and i also see that the lighting wasnt very consistent; however, i think you could still see the improvement in the density of the hair. I am incredibly happy and satisfied with my looks now, i wish you all guys a head full of hair, its truly a blessing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c53omlng818g1.jpg?width=963&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6434709562a019c719f94175026cb9ab90ae471f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z1rkaq8h818g1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01127c622122c469b3ed6576e424548302840d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xh6rbr0i818g1.jpg?width=1212&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=811befad7bf80b89d64d84e12219fa7e2fdda787\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xuc2hgqi818g1.jpg?width=963&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c9ca9e45affa5f726d2358231f7c110380a0d0c\n\n",

I’ve been trying to achieve a wet hair look for ages, but I still haven’t got it.\n\nPics 1-2 show how my hair looks right after a shower or the beach (no products)—it’s legit perfect. The issue is, once it dries, it turns into pics 4-6, which isn’t bad, but not what I want.\n\nIdeally, I’d love it to look like pic 3 (Neymar style). I’m a total noob at styling curly hair, so I don’t know how to get there.\n\nOn products: Most I’ve tried (leave-in conditioner, gel, curl cream) make my hair too curly and don’t keep that straight, wet vibe from pics 1-2. They tangle my curls more and turn it coily, like a lil fro.\n\nMy routine: Wash 4 times a week (after sports), then air dry. Shampoo once, conditioner every other time. No real products except a bit of oil sometimes or sea salt spray. I sleep with a bonnet and silk pillowcase.\n\nSorry for the essay, but if anyone has recommendations, I’d really appreciate it ✌🏽 (Also if anyone knows what hair type I have that'd be much appreciated!!)",

I’ve been using vitamin C serum in the mornings and tretinoin 0.025% on alternate nights. I was sticking to Korean skincare routine and exfoliated once a week.\n\nAbout 3 months ago, I went through a lot of mental stress, which caused a severe acne breakout only on my right cheek (not a single acne on my left cheek). The acne itself has healed now, but I’m left with persistent red spots on right cheek. From my research, I believe this might be PIE (post-inflammatory erythema).\n\nI wear sunscreen daily and have continued tretinoin, but it doesn’t seem to be making much difference to the redness. The spots haven’t faded much over time, and it’s starting to worry me.\n\nHas anyone dealt with PIE before?\n\nWhat ingredients or treatments helped you fade it faster?\n\nIs there anything I should add or remove from my routine?

I irregularly use \\*0.1% tretinoin cream\\* that is too heavy of a texture for my face, should I try to use it more regularly? Any oral medication I should look into like \\*Spironolactone\\*?

Sometimes it can be dry, flaky yet oily at the same time.\nIt's fairly sensitive, but it's not overly so. \nIt can handle _most_ products, but I'd quite like to avoid heavily perfumed products with humongous ingredients lists.\n\nMy current \"routine\" is wash with water daily in the shower, exfoliate once a week with a damp towel, and about 2-3 times a week I will cleanse it with dove bar soap when I wash the rest of my body.\nIf it's feeling particularly dry afterwards, I will just use a bit of E45 or Nivea.\n\nThe only products I've bought and used regularly is No7 and Boots botanicals (UK products from Boots drugstore).\nIn the past I've used mechanical exfoliants such as St. Ives apricot scrub, but feel they're too harsh for my skin.\nHowever, I've never committed to anything long enough to give it a chance but am finally in a place where I can do that responsibly.\n\nI had success using nicotinamide as a teenager, for mild acne.\n\nI'd say my skin is fairly good overall (was a lot worse) but I do get redness around the edges of my nose and across my face (the \"mask\" area) with a little on my chin.\nI only get the odd proper pimple now but my face is covered in hundreds of teeny tiny firm spots. I can feel them when I run my hands over it.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts in general on what you recommend?\n\nI don't want too many products. Im happy to go mid-range. Hair end some money but not bankrupt me lol!\n\nI have _zero_ knowledge on the science and ingredients behind chemical exfoliants and anti ageing products.\n\n*I would love a recommendation for a chemical exfoliant for a first timer.*\n\nPossibly where to start with the better chemical ingredients and anti ageing too, as I have the very beginnings of crows feet and eye crinkles, forehead lines etc.\n\nI don't know where to start! Feeling overwhelmed. 😭\nHappy to spend some money, mid-range but not extortionate. Would prefer the more affordable end at the moment. If I take it seriously then I can spend more in future.\n\nAppreciate absolutely any opinions, comments or advice. 🫶🏻\n\nThank you so much! \nA.x",

I applied only moisturiser and forgot sunscreen in a rush. Result- got significant redness on face and neck (maybe its a mild level of sunburn)\n\nSo I’m trying to fix it now by cool water splashing every few hours. But whenever I apply moisturiser my face is really itching and its also like peeling slightly near the mouth area. \n\nVaseline gluta hya moisturiser is causing burning itching feel. (so on a clean face again also used a bit of nivea but that too is itching and burning) these 2 products are really good using it since three years- so the product is not a problem. The problem is sunburn and maybe my skin isn’t able to take in any moisturiser(trust me I tried 2 moisturisers and also some body milk directly on my face- but they all just sit on the face.) There is also a patch of roughness maybe small red bumps on my skin which is not allowing moisturiser to go in) and it really burns too and itches. What should I do? Please someone help if faced similar problem or knows more about curing sunburn. Google suggested aloevera pulp direct application on the redness; but I don’t think it’s a good idea to use something directly without knowing much. Attached photos of my products. ",

      "content": "Hello,\n\nI was wondering if there’s anything to improve about my hair and also wasn’t that sure about my routine. In terms of products I own literally every product in the last picture except the smoothie and heat protectant, and also have a mousse and curl styling cream from that brand (kruidvat).\n\nI would classify my hair as medium porosity, leaning thin, not very dense.\n\nPictures 1-2 are after using a regular (non curly) shampoo because I thought I might have buildup, then hair mask (was suspecting some heat damage too), and then detangling with the “hydrating conditioner” and rinsing out with cold water.\nI separated them the day after and applied just a little bit of the leave in and styling cream on the dry hair. I was happy with the results.\n\nPic 3 is after co-washing with the “perfect curls conditioner”, then once it dried I separated with the oil on my hands and then tried applying the leave in and styling cream again like yesterday but it came out worse, sprayed a bit of water to try to tame it and it didn’t help lol. So it came out more frizzy than pics 1-2.\n\nWhat I’m trying to figure out is : \n- I don’t know if I should ditch the blue “perfect curls” line because my hair pattern is too tight for those (referring to the graph that Kruidvat provides for their products, last picture)?\n- Should I stop co-washing? I’m wondering if my hair is too straight for it, and because the water where I live is pretty hard, if I should just shampoo every time. The “perfect curls shampoo” seems to be a softer shampoo.\n- Can I use the “clarifying shampoo” as a chelating shampoo because of the hard water? \n\nI’ve tried analyzing the ingredients but honestly can’t figure out much from the results. These products are all marketed as CG proof anyway but it’s more about figuring out if they’re right for my routine.\n\nI can provide any list of ingredients if needed.\nThanks to anyone that read this far!",

In my eyes I have a big forehead so I’ve been wanting to get some sort of bangs to hide it. However I’ve just been wanting bangs in general to change up my looks a bit. The problem for me is that it’s a huge commitment and I’m scared. I’ll mess it up and look insane. My other major concern is that I have a pretty deep widows peak and I’m scared that it will mess up the bangs themselves. I’m aware that I will have to train them and do constant maintaining and I’m willing to put in the effort. Does anybody have any tips on how to slowly start? I’m not looking for Zooey Deschanel bangs, but more wispy light ones and maybe even curtain bangs. Here’s some photos of me for the record.",

      "content": "Hi all! I have PIH and possibly melasma so my derm put me on a compounded cream with hydroquinone 12%, ascorbic acid, kojic acid and TXA. I’ve been using it twice daily for 4 weeks, went down to once per day this past week and then ran out before I could really taper off. The bottle was really heavy so I didn’t realize I was running out faster than I expected. My derm didn’t even tell me about a taper, but I learned about that here so did plan on trying to wean off.\n\nI have gotten great results (yeay!), so definitely don’t want to screw things up. The issue is that I’m going on vacation in two days, so I don’t have time to get a refill. However, I’m also on prescription tretinoin, azaleic acid and use a moisturizer with niacinamide. I’ve been on the first two for years and just recently added the niacinamide. These three all help with PIH and melasma, so I’m wondering if I’m really even at risk of rebound hyperpigmentation. \n\nJust in case, I was going to go to my dermatologist tomorrow and get C E ferulic to take with me and use in the mornings. I figure that will help me avoid sun damage that could exacerbate the PIH while at the pool. (I’m also going to cover up and hide like a vampire under a big hat.)\n\nWhat do you all think? Am I way overthinking this?",

Looking for a moisturiser to use here, please suggest the best one.\n\nResults-\n\nCleanser: i’ve been using for about 6-7 months now and i dont know if it works but i have noticed that oil production has reduced in my T-zone. It has never broken my skin out or anything harsh like that so I’ll probably repurchase it and continue using it.\n\nSunscreen: Been using this since the start of summer this year so around March, and I quite like it. Again I honestly don’t know if it’s doing anything because I have fair skin with redness on my cheeks 😭. But I haven’t tanned so i guess it’s working? It’s light-weight, blends into my skin quick, no white-cast, and the texture is thin, not thick at all, hasn’t caused any breakouts so I have recently repurchased it and will continue using it.\n\nToner: Just bought it a week ago, no clue if it’s working or not, hasn’t caused a breakout, let’s see if it reduces pores as it claims. Will update in the comments if I notice improvements.\n\nSerum: Definitely noticed a difference from the first week itself, I used 5% for like 6 months and it hardly did anything so I started using 10%, I can see the redness reducing and other people have noticed it too so i’ll keep using this one.\n\nTLDR: Sharing my review of these 4 products &amp; Requesting y’all to drop some advice/comments about my routine, what other serums I can try to reduce redness and acne scars, and please suggest a good moisturiser for my skin type.",

Thanks\n\nHey all!\n\n    Single guy here struggling to make any connections. Discussing with people I've learned or at least been told that a guy with long hair is more a niche. I have enough obstacles as is and would like to broaden my appeal to more potential partners.\n    I had been growing my hair out for the last 2 years. I've throughly enjoyed it myself but I've noticed less matches on dating apps. Unsure if its due to something else or the fact I have long hair now. I recently did the undercut manbun where its short around the ears but I'm beginning to think this is not enough.\n    Having short hair most of my life... I almost always used to walk into the barber and simply get close to a buzz cut. Should I do this again? \n   Is there any potential midway cuts you guys would suggest or think would look good? I don't know what I should experiment with. I've always been self conscious about my widows peak, so unsure what I could pull off.\n\nPS. I'm fully aware my beard is out of hand at the moment.\n    \n      Anything helps. Thanks",

Does anyone have any experience with doing multiple rounds of the aphogee treatment, and if so- how often did you use it? I will include photos of my hair in comments.\n\nRoutine: I alternate between brands of shampoo and conditioner. Currently I switch between Redken Acidic Bonding shampoo+conditioner but I also use Garnier Wholeblends, which I am planning to swap for a better CG brand after I use the rest of it.\n\nI alternate what I use post-shower as I'm trying to find what works best, I bounce between various brands of leave-ins, frizz taming products, oils, and serums. I air dry my hair, currently no nighttime protection and no \"refresh\" either. I am currently reintroducing curly haircare to my life after neglecting my hair for a long time.",

I think the problem is a mix of dryness because of the cold temperature and overwashing; I used to wash my hands a LOT both at work and at home (I'm borderline maniac with that) and it just fucks me up. I work retail so I deal with a lot of dirty stuff (from plain dust to rotten fruits) and I always feel nasty and have to wash my hands, though I've been trying to reduce that lately and I seem to be managing it. When I get home I apply cream and leave my hands be, but it doesn't seem to be working at all, they still look very dry, red (especially between the fingers and on the knuckles), and feel a bit warm to the touch. I'm helpless because it looks so bad and I don't know what else I can do to soothe my hands. In the future I wanna get them tattooed but I know it's impossible if they stay in this state :(. Any help is appreciated, much thanks!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
