      "content": "I’m starting to believe that anal sex, especially in gay communities, is correlated with the potentiality for maintaining hair. Hear me out: I’ve observed that gay men, who often engage in more anal activities as part of their sex lives, generally have thicker, more fuller hair deeper into their 30’s+. For example, look at the queer scenes in places like San Francisco or West Hollywood—you’ll see a ton of guys with lush locks, from twinks to bears, from the club kids to the professionals. Of course, there’s always the “balding gene,” but compared to straight dudes grinding away in vanilla missionary, not even close. Same with other vibrant gay hubs around the world, like Berlin or Sydney, and more, I’m sure.\nI believe a reason for this is because of the intense physical and hormonal rush from anal sex. We know that blood flow is crucial for keeping follicles active and nourished, and bottoming (or topping, for that matter) directly amps up circulation through the body, including the scalp. Every time I hook up and go for anal, for example, I feel a strong surge of endorphins and blood pumping everywhere, even making my head tingle. Yet, I dialed back on it in my early 20s, mostly because of relationship drama. My ex still has a full head of hair into his 50s, and his mane is epic. He’s super active in the gay scene and bottoms like a champ. I’ve resorted to using rogaine for my crown. Of course, my straight uncle’s side is also prone to balding, but they were all about that repressed, no-anal life growing up.\nWhat do you guys think? Do you think regular anal sex can sustain blood flow to the scalp? In the least, it should help with maintaining longer, no?\nNot saying a lack of anal sex results in hair loss, but that a high intake of it—especially in gay contexts—may encourage blood flow to the scalp, and thus maintain hair density longer.",

Shampoo, using noughty shampoo, alternating between clarifying and normal frizz\n2. Conditioner, john freida repair since my hair is so damaged\n3. Brush conditioner in in shower, scrunch it and leave for a few mins\n4. Rinse and put LOTS of leave in conditioner in, I’m not sure what this is the label fell off!! it feels smooth like seaweed when I stop. Brush that in while still dripping in shower. Scrunch again\n5. Plop in towel for a short time while getting dressed\n6. Put in a creme, using noughty serum very gentle just running it over the waves (my hair doesnt curl until its dry, then the waves seems to suddenly curl up) not stretching them out at all\n7. Then do the same with a mega hold only curls gel\n8. Shake again (gently) to get natural clumping and curl pattern then scrunch in cotton t shirt lightly a few times\n9. Diffuse until nearly dry. \n10.

      "content": "Hi everyone 👋\n\nI need some help choosing a lightweight moisturizer for oily, acne-prone skin, especially for winter.\n\nSkin type:\n\n• Oily, acne-prone\n\n• Breaks out if moisturizers are too heavy or occlusive\n\nCurrent routine (worked well until recently):\n\nAM &amp; PM:\n\n• Bioderma Sebium Actif Salicylic Acid Cleanser (twice a day)\n\n• The Derma Co 5% Nia-Ceramide Mattifying Moisturizer\n\n• La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo (+/Unifiant) as Spot Treatment \n\n• Re’equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen (AM)\n\nThis routine was working great, but with winter weather, I suddenly started getting breakouts, so I suspect my moisturizer or cleanser might not be suiting me anymore.\n\nI’ve attached images of all the moisturizers I’m considering:\n\n• Sebamed Clear Face Care Gel\n\n• Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel\n\n• Deconstruct Oil-Free Moisturizer (3% NMF + Panthenol)\n\n• Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Gel-Crème\n\n• The Derma Co 5% Nia-Ceramide (currently using)\n\nI really liked the texture and feel of La Roche-Posay Toleriane Sensitive Fluide (super lightweight, calming, non-greasy), but unfortunately it’s not available in India.\n\nWhich of these moisturizers would be the closest alternative to LRP Toleriane Sensitive Fluide in terms of texture + ingredients?\n\nWhich one would you recommend for oily, acne-prone skin in winter, without clogging pores?\n\nI’m also looking for a tinted spot treatment similar to La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo (+/Unifiant) — something with salicylic acid + niacinamide + tint (India-available). Any recommendations?\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone with similar skin type 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

I dry my hair with a regular towel, brush it and then blow-dry. It constantly feels woolly, electrocuted and unkempt (seriously, since i was a kid, people think i don’t brush my hair because of how frizzy it is).\n\nOn the last image, my attempt was washing my hair loke regular, but i also dried it with a t-shirt and added some cantou mousse—i blow-dryed it with a diffuser.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to make my hair look nicer?? I’ve been struggling with this for years, i never know whether my hair would be curlier/wavier or even worse if i switched up my routine. Advice very appreciated!!",

So I was wondering if this is a good start?\n\nQuestions! I'm very confused on cleansing oils, I heard that it's necessary for getting sunscreen and makeup off your skin. But I thought makeup was for cleansing balms? Should I buy a cleansing balm along with the oil? Or should I just use the cleansing oil? \n\nI also don't really know what cleansing oils to use but I have my mind set on the sunscreen and facewash. I don't really want to buy a separate cleansing balm so If anyone can suggest cleansing oils suitable for cleaning makeup and sunscreen that'd be sweet. \n\nI have usually dry-combination skin and blackheads/black dots in my nose if that helps.\n\nAlso I'm Bangladeshi so stuff like CeraVe or any european-american, Amazon products are either unavailable in most authentic bd sites or far too expensive. I can find Korean and Unilever products or anything else(I usually try to avoid Unilever products though)",

      "title": "[Routine Help] 47 yo male, oily to normal skin, help with the basics - need to add more moisturizer in the Winter",
      "content": "Hello, I've started my journey this year, a bit before the summer.\n\nBefore I was doing my routine i got a lot of redness in face, mostly after showering, flaking around the nose that got worse with stress and weather, black heads and some sun damage in the nose that harder to see now.\n\nThe initial reason I started doing cosmetics is to delay aging signs. My skin became a bit thinner under the eyes with aging. There wasn't a lot of improvement there BUT it's somewhat better now.\n\nI can't have too many steps in my routine, i am always in a hurry. Also I sweat a lot from my forehead and sometimes it can get a little messy.\n\n**In the summer my routine was fine but now i feel my face is a bit too dry. Maybe I need to add a moisturizer?**\n\nThis is my routine that i came up with after some trial an error (note: I'm in Europe, some products are a bit different from the USA offerings):\n\n# Morning\n\n**CeraVe Cleansing Micellar Water or Foaming Cleanser**\n\nI choose this specific micellar water because it has ceramides and niacinamide. I don't use makeup so the purpose is only to remove dirt and previous cosmetics.\n\nWhen I shower in the morning or after the gym I use Cerave Foaming Cleanser and don't use Micellar water. Cerave Foaming Cleanser feels great in my face. It was the first thing i started using and still using to this day.\n\n**Medik8 Super C Ferulic**\n\nI was using Vichy Vitamin C but recently \"upgraded\" to Medik8. It seems to work fine, no real comments on this. I wanted to try Ferulic acid in my routine and Skinceuticals was too expensive for me :) I share this with my girlfriend so that we go through a vial/bottle faster and it keeps fresh.\n\n**LRP Anthelios UVMUNE 440 oil control fluid spf 50+**\n\nThis seems to be the sunscreen everyone recommends. I use the oil control because my face can sometimes get a bit too shiny.\n\nI cannot find the waterproof version locally but I think it would be better for me because I sweat a lot from my forehead, as mentioned before.\n\n# Evening\n\n**CeraVe Cleansing Micellar Water**\n\nSame as in the morning.\n\n**Medik8 Crystal Retinal 6**\n\nI was using a Vichy retinol before AND retinal really made a difference. My nose is now almost without any black heads. I don't even use BHA anymore. Some other improvements, a brownish \"dot\" disappeared, i think that was sun damage that got reverse, it still there but now it is purple/rose (i think its sebaceous hyperplasia but not 100% sure) and much less noticeable.\n\n**Medik8 Advanced Night Restore**\n\nI hadn't a clue on what to use to moisturize in the evening and since it is recommended on by Medik8 after retinal I sheepishly followed their recommendation.\n\nSome of the options i saw recommend on reddit like Cerave Night Cream aren't available locally.\n\nHowever I am happy with Advanced Night Restore. My girlfriend likes the smell too so it's a win-win :)\n\n# Things is don't use anymore / use occasionally\n\n**Medik8 Eyelift Peptides** \\- this pills a little and seems to be an extra step i'm not very happy with so i don't use it every time, I'm just trying to use it all before it gets spoiled.\n\n**COSRX BHA blackhead power liquid** \\- Since I've started retinal this seems a little redundant as the black heads have almost disappeared. I still might use it from time to time, 4-6 weeks. Seems wasteful to dispose of a bottle that is almost full.\n\n**Cerave SA Smoothing Cleanser** \\- My face does not like this! I got some inflammation after using this just once. I still use just a tiny bit on the back of my ears from time to time and in the feet and between the toes. \n\n",

Is that an okay price for the ingredients or am i being ripped off? It’s from a small acne studio. It does work and it doesn’t leave my skin dehydrated, but I’m i can’t afford it anymore and I’m looking to cheaper more affordable alternatives less than $40-50. I tried the cera ve retinol with benzoyl peroxide (2.5%) (the same mix i did with the previous product and okay to do according to my esthetician) twice a week for a month now and my skin is so extremely dry my smile lines became more prominent :(. Last week i used it once a week and the following days my skin felt soo tight. I even use Vaseline at night and cera ve moisturizer. I also started purging like crazy as well. Idk if dryness is temporary or if i should switch to a new one or if i should just go back Retinyl Esters since I feel my very dry skin won’t be able to tolerate any stronger levels or maybe I’m just using one that doesn’t fit my skin? Any advice thanks! 🙏",

I went to Sally’s and asked for their advice to get to a medium/neutral brown. I was going to go with a lighter brown/mahogany but was told that wouldn’t work. The black is the result of ION color remover, ION 4nn and then a bright red mixed together - per their instructions. \n\nWhats your advice to get to a lighter, more natural brown/blonde?

I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

The issue is, once it dries, it turns into pics 4-6, which isn’t bad, but not what I want.\n\nIdeally, I’d love it to look like pic 3 (Neymar style). I’m a total noob at styling curly hair, so I don’t know how to get there.\n\nOn products: Most I’ve tried (leave-in conditioner, gel, curl cream) make my hair too curly and don’t keep that straight, wet vibe from pics 1-2. They tangle my curls more and turn it coily, like a lil fro.\n\nMy routine: Wash 4 times a week (after sports), then air dry. Shampoo once, conditioner every other time. No real products except a bit of oil sometimes or sea salt spray. I sleep with a bonnet and silk pillowcase.\n\nSorry for the essay, but if anyone has recommendations, I’d really appreciate it ✌🏽 (Also if anyone knows what hair type I have that'd be much appreciated!!)",
