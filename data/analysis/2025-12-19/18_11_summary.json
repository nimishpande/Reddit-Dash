      "content": "I have always been afraid of expressing myself as my mom and uncles used to tease me for how my hair curled and I became embarrased by it (it was just teasing but I took it to heart because I THOUGHT curls were \"feminine\" and I wanted to be a big strong man in a rural area. I know curls aren't a feminine thing btw) anyway my friend encouraged me to grow my hair out at the beginning of 2024 and I'm so grateful. People always compliment my hair, and I hate that it took me so long to embrace a part of me. The last photo is from May of this year when I had a different method so you can see the difference. Thank you to everyone who commented on my last curly hair post and gave me tips!! Have a great holiday season everyone 💖\n\nProducts listed at bottom.\nRoutine:\nI wash my hair two times a week. For one wash just shampoo and conditioner.\nOnce a week: wash with clarifying shampoo, then shampoo, then conditioner then conditioning treatment\nWith still dripping wet hair, apply curl creme then scrunch, then apply mousse and scrunch thoroughly, then gel and scrunch.\nDiffuse hair. Scrunch out crunch or use hair oil\n\n\nShampoo: not your mother's curl defining shampoo\nConditioner: not your mother's curl defining conditioner\nDeep conditioning treatment: Mielle Organics Babassu Oil and Mint Deep Conditioner (5-15 minutes) rinse out\nCurl creme: Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Avocado Leave–In Defining Cream\nMousse:Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Activating Mousse\nCurl Gel: Briogeo Curl Charisma Rice Amino + Quinoa Frizz Control Gel\nOil: Oaui hair oil\n I wear a satin bonnet to bed every night, and use satin pillowcases and do not do a refresh routine.

I think this might be my first day I look slightly sane. \n\nI used TONS of leave in conditioner as an experiment and I think it worked. Its so soft and bouncey.\nRoutine: \n1. Shampoo, using noughty shampoo, alternating between clarifying and normal frizz\n2. Conditioner, john freida repair since my hair is so damaged\n3. Brush conditioner in in shower, scrunch it and leave for a few mins\n4. Rinse and put LOTS of leave in conditioner in, I’m not sure what this is the label fell off!! it feels smooth like seaweed when I stop. Brush that in while still dripping in shower. Scrunch again\n5. Plop in towel for a short time while getting dressed\n6. Put in a creme, using noughty serum very gentle just running it over the waves (my hair doesnt curl until its dry, then the waves seems to suddenly curl up) not stretching them out at all\n7. Then do the same with a mega hold only curls gel\n8. Shake again (gently) to get natural clumping and curl pattern then scrunch in cotton t shirt lightly a few times\n9. Diffuse until nearly dry. \n10. Leave an hour then scrunch it out and give it a shake to poof\n\nI also wear a silk scarf at night which has made a HUGE difference and I can leave it a day if I clip it up\n\nIts so many steps.

      "content": "Hey yall. So basically, I was dealing with issues with my liver and my birth control pill without knowing, and my hair completely changed over 2 years of this happening. I’m addressing the source now, and it should be improving eventually, but I’m having a really hard time not hating my hair. I miss my old hair. It defined easily with minimal product and effort and pretty much always looked good. Now I put in 3x the effort for 1/3 of the results, and they’re inconsistent too. I don’t know how to have anything but resentment towards my hair for reflecting health issues that could’ve been caught earlier if healthcare professionals bothered to check anything. It’s also been falling out since February and isn’t stopping. I rarely like how my hair looks now, and I don’t know what to do about it. It is not a length thing, as my hair was starting to loosen up when it was still shorter too. I’ll list my routine, so really anything helps. Maybe from people who have my current hair type? I haven’t felt compelled to give up on caring for my hair in a long time, but this has definitely taken me there. \n\nHair type now: wavy, coarse, medium density \nHair type before: curly, coarse, high density \n\nCurrent routine: Innersense clarity hair bath and hydrating cream conditioner. Styler is usually 1 lightweight foam and 1 gel,  ex. the tgin miracle foam + innersense I create curl memory. Usually brush styled with a denman or bounce curl definition brush, scrunched, diffused.

I didn’t mind them because I thought they would go away, and I assumed it was only because of my period. I never had a pimple that stayed for a long time before.\n\nWeeks passed, and they didn’t go away. At first, they were small, tiny bumps. Ever since I moved here to Japan, it got worse. It started appearing on my chin and forehead too and continued to spread, which has been making me worried and more insecure. I’ve never had this kind of acne before because I never had pimples that stayed for so long.\n\nI thought it was probably because of the products I was putting on my face because of my work (I’m a UGC creator). But for the past few weeks, I stopped using everything and only used Dr. Althea 345 Cream. My pimples wouldn’t show in the morning, then would appear about 30 minutes after waking up. I stopped using the Dr. Althea 345 Cream after my mom told me to stop. Now I only use Pixelpure Gentle Cleanser and sometimes Fation Deep Pore Cleansing Foam.\n\nI don’t even know what type of acne this is, and it’s still here and getting worse—mostly on my hairline and cheeks. It grows back, then fades, then grows back again.\n\nThese past few days, I noticed that most of the acne on my cheeks turned into black spots, and I need help figuring out how to fix it.

      "content": "Hi everyone 👋\n\nI need some help choosing a lightweight moisturizer for oily, acne-prone skin, especially for winter.\n\nSkin type:\n\n• Oily, acne-prone\n\n• Breaks out if moisturizers are too heavy or occlusive\n\nCurrent routine (worked well until recently):\n\nAM &amp; PM:\n\n• Bioderma Sebium Actif Salicylic Acid Cleanser (twice a day)\n\n• The Derma Co 5% Nia-Ceramide Mattifying Moisturizer\n\n• La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo (+/Unifiant) as Spot Treatment \n\n• Re’equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen (AM)\n\nThis routine was working great, but with winter weather, I suddenly started getting breakouts, so I suspect my moisturizer or cleanser might not be suiting me anymore.\n\nI’ve attached images of all the moisturizers I’m considering:\n\n• Sebamed Clear Face Care Gel\n\n• Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel\n\n• Deconstruct Oil-Free Moisturizer (3% NMF + Panthenol)\n\n• Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Gel-Crème\n\n• The Derma Co 5% Nia-Ceramide (currently using)\n\nI really liked the texture and feel of La Roche-Posay Toleriane Sensitive Fluide (super lightweight, calming, non-greasy), but unfortunately it’s not available in India.\n\nWhich of these moisturizers would be the closest alternative to LRP Toleriane Sensitive Fluide in terms of texture + ingredients?\n\nWhich one would you recommend for oily, acne-prone skin in winter, without clogging pores?\n\nI’m also looking for a tinted spot treatment similar to La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo (+/Unifiant) — something with salicylic acid + niacinamide + tint (India-available). Any recommendations?\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone with similar skin type 🙏\n\nThanks in advance!",

So I was wondering if this is a good start?\n\nQuestions! I'm very confused on cleansing oils, I heard that it's necessary for getting sunscreen and makeup off your skin. But I thought makeup was for cleansing balms? Should I buy a cleansing balm along with the oil? Or should I just use the cleansing oil? \n\nI also don't really know what cleansing oils to use but I have my mind set on the sunscreen and facewash. I don't really want to buy a separate cleansing balm so If anyone can suggest cleansing oils suitable for cleaning makeup and sunscreen that'd be sweet. \n\nI have usually dry-combination skin and blackheads/black dots in my nose if that helps.\n\nAlso I'm Bangladeshi so stuff like CeraVe or any european-american, Amazon products are either unavailable in most authentic bd sites or far too expensive.

It constantly feels woolly, electrocuted and unkempt (seriously, since i was a kid, people think i don’t brush my hair because of how frizzy it is).\n\nOn the last image, my attempt was washing my hair loke regular, but i also dried it with a t-shirt and added some cantou mousse—i blow-dryed it with a diffuser.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to make my hair look nicer??

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "When I was younger my hair was so thick and healthy. Now even if I use the same routine, my hair keeps falling out and my curls dont stay for long. Even if I change up my routine or products, it doesnt help. I have an oily scalp and medium porosity hair and no matter what I do my hair just doesnt get better :c\n\nIve tried going to a scalp doctor, trying sulphate free products, sheamoisture products, double cleansing, taking vitamins and sleeping earlier but nothing works and im soooo frustrated\n\nSo far ive tried coconut, argan, jojoba oil and argan works best but now it doesnt work as well as it used to before. I tried watsons natural and sheamoisture products. Usually i deep condition once a week with the sheamoisture manuka honey and manfura oil. If not I use watsons natural aloe vera conditioner. I double shampoo first, then condition, then leabe it on for 20 mins. Then rinse it out, spray leave in conditioner and gel. Then i finger curl it. I usually just let it air dry/ plop it but sometimes I diffuse it. I use a silk pillowcase as a bonnet doesnt work for me.\n\n Any advice/ tips please?\n\nPics of my hair now vs when I was younger\n\n",
