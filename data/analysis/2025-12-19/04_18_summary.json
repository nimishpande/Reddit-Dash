I know its not some crazy transformation but i'm satisfied with my current hair density and thinkness, and everyone i know who used to say \"hey dude i think you are balding\" \" you gotta do something about it, your sculp is very visible\" are now making remarks on how much my hair has improved. I'm sorry about the quality of the pictures, and i also see that the lighting wasnt very consistent; however, i think you could still see the improvement in the density of the hair. I am incredibly happy and satisfied with my looks now, i wish you all guys a head full of hair, its truly a blessing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c53omlng818g1.jpg?width=963&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6434709562a019c719f94175026cb9ab90ae471f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z1rkaq8h818g1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01127c622122c469b3ed6576e424548302840d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xh6rbr0i818g1.jpg?width=1212&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=811befad7bf80b89d64d84e12219fa7e2fdda787\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xuc2hgqi818g1.jpg?width=963&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c9ca9e45affa5f726d2358231f7c110380a0d0c\n\n",

I’ve been trying to achieve a wet hair look for ages, but I still haven’t got it.\n\nPics 1-2 show how my hair looks right after a shower or the beach (no products)—it’s legit perfect. The issue is, once it dries, it turns into pics 4-6, which isn’t bad, but not what I want.\n\nIdeally, I’d love it to look like pic 3 (Neymar style). I’m a total noob at styling curly hair, so I don’t know how to get there.\n\nOn products: Most I’ve tried (leave-in conditioner, gel, curl cream) make my hair too curly and don’t keep that straight, wet vibe from pics 1-2. They tangle my curls more and turn it coily, like a lil fro.\n\nMy routine: Wash 4 times a week (after sports), then air dry. Shampoo once, conditioner every other time. No real products except a bit of oil sometimes or sea salt spray. I sleep with a bonnet and silk pillowcase.\n\nSorry for the essay, but if anyone has recommendations, I’d really appreciate it ✌🏽 (Also if anyone knows what hair type I have that'd be much appreciated!!)",

In my eyes I have a big forehead so I’ve been wanting to get some sort of bangs to hide it. However I’ve just been wanting bangs in general to change up my looks a bit. The problem for me is that it’s a huge commitment and I’m scared. I’ll mess it up and look insane. My other major concern is that I have a pretty deep widows peak and I’m scared that it will mess up the bangs themselves. I’m aware that I will have to train them and do constant maintaining and I’m willing to put in the effort. Does anybody have any tips on how to slowly start? I’m not looking for Zooey Deschanel bangs, but more wispy light ones and maybe even curtain bangs. Here’s some photos of me for the record.",

      "content": "I’m genuinely confused why this isn’t talked about more.\n\nI took Accutane and was left with chronically dry, low-oil skin, but I still get acne. Not oily acne - more like persistent, inflamed breakouts that flare when my skin is stressed or over-treated.\n\nWhat I’ve learned (and experienced) is that dry skin itself can cause acne, and here’s how:\n\n• Barrier damage: When skin is too dry, the barrier cracks. This lets irritants and bacteria in, triggering inflammation around pores. • Inflammation first, acne second: Dry skin stays in a low-level inflamed state, which makes follicles more likely to clog and swell. • Abnormal shedding: Low oil changes how dead skin cells shed inside pores, making blockages more likely even without excess sebum. • Compensatory reactions: Skin sometimes overreacts to dryness by producing uneven oil or thickening cells around pores - again leading to breakouts. • Slower healing: Dry skin heals acne lesions more slowly, so breakouts linger and feel “constant.”\n\nSo acne isn’t always from too much oil - sometimes it’s from not enough oil and a broken barrier.\n\nWhat frustrates me is this: Dermatology treats acne as a medical condition, but when acne is driven by dry skin (especially post-Accutane), the dryness is treated like a cosmetic issue.\n\nThe advice is usually: “Just moisturize more” “Use a retinoid” “Use benzoyl peroxide”\n\nWhich often makes the dryness worse… and the acne never fully resolves.\n\nIt feels like dermatology spent decades learning how to suppress oil, but hasn’t caught up to what happens when oil is too low - or when sebaceous glands don’t recover normally after Accutane.\n\nIf dry skin can directly cause acne, and acne is a disease, then why isn’t chronic dry skin treated as a medical problem too?\n\nI’m curious: •\tAnyone else have dry, post-Accutane skin that still breaks out? •\tHas anything actually helped long-term? •\tHas a derm ever acknowledged this as a real mechanism and not just “use thicker lotion”?\n\nI don’t think this is rare - I think it’s just overlooked.",

Sometimes it can be dry, flaky yet oily at the same time.\nIt's fairly sensitive, but it's not overly so. \nIt can handle _most_ products, but I'd quite like to avoid heavily perfumed products with humongous ingredients lists.\n\nMy current \"routine\" is wash with water daily in the shower, exfoliate once a week with a damp towel, and about 2-3 times a week I will cleanse it with dove bar soap when I wash the rest of my body.\nIf it's feeling particularly dry afterwards, I will just use a bit of E45 or Nivea.\n\nThe only products I've bought and used regularly is No7 and Boots botanicals (UK products from Boots drugstore).\nIn the past I've used mechanical exfoliants such as St. Ives apricot scrub, but feel they're too harsh for my skin.\nHowever, I've never committed to anything long enough to give it a chance but am finally in a place where I can do that responsibly.\n\nI had success using nicotinamide as a teenager, for mild acne.\n\nI'd say my skin is fairly good overall (was a lot worse) but I do get redness around the edges of my nose and across my face (the \"mask\" area) with a little on my chin.\nI only get the odd proper pimple now but my face is covered in hundreds of teeny tiny firm spots. I can feel them when I run my hands over it.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts in general on what you recommend?\n\nI don't want too many products. Im happy to go mid-range. Hair end some money but not bankrupt me lol!\n\nI have _zero_ knowledge on the science and ingredients behind chemical exfoliants and anti ageing products.\n\n*I would love a recommendation for a chemical exfoliant for a first timer.*\n\nPossibly where to start with the better chemical ingredients and anti ageing too, as I have the very beginnings of crows feet and eye crinkles, forehead lines etc.\n\nI don't know where to start! Feeling overwhelmed. 😭\nHappy to spend some money, mid-range but not extortionate. Would prefer the more affordable end at the moment. If I take it seriously then I can spend more in future.\n\nAppreciate absolutely any opinions, comments or advice. 🫶🏻\n\nThank you so much! \nA.x",

I applied only moisturiser and forgot sunscreen in a rush. Result- got significant redness on face and neck (maybe its a mild level of sunburn)\n\nSo I’m trying to fix it now by cool water splashing every few hours. But whenever I apply moisturiser my face is really itching and its also like peeling slightly near the mouth area. \n\nVaseline gluta hya moisturiser is causing burning itching feel. (so on a clean face again also used a bit of nivea but that too is itching and burning) these 2 products are really good using it since three years- so the product is not a problem. The problem is sunburn and maybe my skin isn’t able to take in any moisturiser(trust me I tried 2 moisturisers and also some body milk directly on my face- but they all just sit on the face.) There is also a patch of roughness maybe small red bumps on my skin which is not allowing moisturiser to go in) and it really burns too and itches. What should I do? Please someone help if faced similar problem or knows more about curing sunburn. Google suggested aloevera pulp direct application on the redness; but I don’t think it’s a good idea to use something directly without knowing much. Attached photos of my products. ",

      "content": "Within the last month or two I’ve been dealing with constant breakouts around either side of my mouth. I never used to have any texture or bumps there and never any breakouts. Now my skin always has little bumps in those areas and as soon as I think I’ve cleared one pimple up, I wake up with a new one the next morning. Also dealing with redness in those areas as well. As someone who has been very lucky with their skin and rarely dealt with breakouts, minus a few spots every so often, I’m really struggling figuring out what’s causing this and how to stop it! \n\nFor a bit of background, I’m 27 and never dealt with acne before. The breakouts are ONLY around my mouth, no other areas. My skin is also very dry in that area and I do use moisturizer. I recently have been exercising more lately (though I don’t sweat in that area of my face). So I bought hypochlorous acid spay to use after exercise. That hasn’t helped. I’ve tried tea tree face wash, hasn’t helped. I’ve tried pimple patches, haven’t helped. I’m not kissing or having anyone touch my face. I’ve tried different cleansers and nothing has helped. Tried face scrubs and different moisturizers and nothing. I do use body butter on my body before bed, so could that be getting onto my pillow somehow and causing this? \n\nExcuse my hairy face haha! And sorry for the crap pictures. It’s hard to get a good picture that shows the texture of my skin. \n\nI’m fully aware this could be much worse. But this is so out of the ordinary for me and it’s really frustrating and taken a hit on my confidence for sure. If anyone has any insight into how/why this is happening and how to heal my skin please let me know! I welcome any and all advice! Thank you for reading 🫶\n\n",

During grad school I narrowed down the routine for my hair. It's very minimalistic lol. \n\n1. Dry brush curls with the Wet Curl brush. \n2. Wash at least every other week, I prefer the Aussie curl brand shampoo. If not washing this shower, then just wet it thoroughly every 3rd or 4th day. (Please note, I am lazy and will sometimes use Bed Bath and Beyond body wash instead, I know, it's shameful, I'm gonna keep doing it anyway.)\n3. If I am actually washing it, do it again until hair is foamy and sudsy.\n4. If I used actual shampoo, I feel obligated to condition with the Aussie curl conditioner here. \n5. Rinse thoroughly.\n6. Wrap in towel for 10 ish minutes. \n7. Wet brush it, then scrunch in Aussie detangler. \n8. Scrunch in a mousse or thick leave in conditioner. Sometimes an oil. I switch brands here a lot. \n9. Plop it into the silk cap and go to bed. \n\nHere's the thing. I'm having my first baby in a few months and I'm concerned I won't have even that much time. Idk how much time newborns take, but I prefer to err on the side of more. Should I cut it off? Haven't had a buzz cut in awhile. Is this routine minimal enough to survive parenthood? I do have lots of support ready and happy to help with baby, but idk how much time I'll have to for things like haircare. I already have a very secure silk wrap for the hospital bed so I don't get those back of neck dreads during birth. \n\nAll advice is welcome! Thank you ladies and gents!",

      "content": "Hello,\n\nI was wondering if there’s anything to improve about my hair and also wasn’t that sure about my routine. In terms of products I own literally every product in the last picture except the smoothie and heat protectant, and also have a mousse and curl styling cream from that brand (kruidvat).\n\nI would classify my hair as medium porosity, leaning thin, not very dense.\n\nPictures 1-2 are after using a regular (non curly) shampoo because I thought I might have buildup, then hair mask (was suspecting some heat damage too), and then detangling with the “hydrating conditioner” and rinsing out with cold water.\nI separated them the day after and applied just a little bit of the leave in and styling cream on the dry hair. I was happy with the results.\n\nPic 3 is after co-washing with the “perfect curls conditioner”, then once it dried I separated with the oil on my hands and then tried applying the leave in and styling cream again like yesterday but it came out worse, sprayed a bit of water to try to tame it and it didn’t help lol. So it came out more frizzy than pics 1-2.\n\nWhat I’m trying to figure out is : \n- I don’t know if I should ditch the blue “perfect curls” line because my hair pattern is too tight for those (referring to the graph that Kruidvat provides for their products, last picture)?\n- Should I stop co-washing? I’m wondering if my hair is too straight for it, and because the water where I live is pretty hard, if I should just shampoo every time. The “perfect curls shampoo” seems to be a softer shampoo.\n- Can I use the “clarifying shampoo” as a chelating shampoo because of the hard water? \n\nI’ve tried analyzing the ingredients but honestly can’t figure out much from the results. These products are all marketed as CG proof anyway but it’s more about figuring out if they’re right for my routine.\n\nI can provide any list of ingredients if needed.\nThanks to anyone that read this far!",

Looking for a moisturiser to use here, please suggest the best one.\n\nResults-\n\nCleanser: i’ve been using for about 6-7 months now and i dont know if it works but i have noticed that oil production has reduced in my T-zone. It has never broken my skin out or anything harsh like that so I’ll probably repurchase it and continue using it.\n\nSunscreen: Been using this since the start of summer this year so around March, and I quite like it. Again I honestly don’t know if it’s doing anything because I have fair skin with redness on my cheeks 😭. But I haven’t tanned so i guess it’s working? It’s light-weight, blends into my skin quick, no white-cast, and the texture is thin, not thick at all, hasn’t caused any breakouts so I have recently repurchased it and will continue using it.\n\nToner: Just bought it a week ago, no clue if it’s working or not, hasn’t caused a breakout, let’s see if it reduces pores as it claims. Will update in the comments if I notice improvements.\n\nSerum: Definitely noticed a difference from the first week itself, I used 5% for like 6 months and it hardly did anything so I started using 10%, I can see the redness reducing and other people have noticed it too so i’ll keep using this one.\n\nTLDR: Sharing my review of these 4 products &amp; Requesting y’all to drop some advice/comments about my routine, what other serums I can try to reduce redness and acne scars, and please suggest a good moisturiser for my skin type.",

      "content": "Hi all! I have PIH and possibly melasma so my derm put me on a compounded cream with hydroquinone 12%, ascorbic acid, kojic acid and TXA. I’ve been using it twice daily for 4 weeks, went down to once per day this past week and then ran out before I could really taper off. The bottle was really heavy so I didn’t realize I was running out faster than I expected. My derm didn’t even tell me about a taper, but I learned about that here so did plan on trying to wean off.\n\nI have gotten great results (yeay!), so definitely don’t want to screw things up. The issue is that I’m going on vacation in two days, so I don’t have time to get a refill. However, I’m also on prescription tretinoin, azaleic acid and use a moisturizer with niacinamide. I’ve been on the first two for years and just recently added the niacinamide. These three all help with PIH and melasma, so I’m wondering if I’m really even at risk of rebound hyperpigmentation. \n\nJust in case, I was going to go to my dermatologist tomorrow and get C E ferulic to take with me and use in the mornings. I figure that will help me avoid sun damage that could exacerbate the PIH while at the pool. (I’m also going to cover up and hide like a vampire under a big hat.)\n\nWhat do you all think? Am I way overthinking this?",

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "Hi! I started following the curly girl method in June and to this day I’m still trying to find the best products that work well with my hair. I think my hair is wavy but I think it does get curly (?) depending on the routine I follow. \n\nI have low porosity, more coarse than fine hair that is thick. I’ve dyed and bleached my hair multiple times in the past 3 years but had 2 big chops before starting CGM. All the hair on my head is healthy hair. \n\nI need help with damn roots. It’s always straight no matter what I do and it ends up looking so awkward. Please help!\n\nHere’s my routine for Day 1:\n\n1. Shampoo and conditioner every 2-4 days with Love Beauty and Planet’s shampoo and conditioner, and twice a month I use ACURE’s clarifying shampoo and use the Tsubaki hair mask after, and I leave my hair sopping wet\n\n2. Section my hair into 2 parts and comb through using a wide tooth comb, I keep my hair parted into 2 and style with my head bent down from here onwards\n\n3. Scrunch out excess water and add in Aussie’s Instant Freeze Gel using the praying hands method and scrunch afterwards\n\n4. Hover diffuse for 3 mins for the gel cast to form. I diffuse on low heat and speed for around 5 mins and add in Aussie’s Curl Refresher and continue diffusing until 80-100% dry\n\nFrom Day 2 onwards, I dampen my hair with water (maybe around 50% wet) and add Aussie’s Curl Refresher. I diffuse to dry. Results are the photos attached. I used to add in gel for day 2+ routines but it ends up weighing my hair down so my current routine is what I think my hair looks best in. \n\nI’ve noticed my hair loves gel and mousse as I’m looking for definition rather than volume since my hair is thick anyway. I have Cantu’s Wave Whip Curling Mousse on the way and want to incorporate it into my Day 1 routine. \n\nAlso, please excuse my English!! It’s not my native language 🥹",
