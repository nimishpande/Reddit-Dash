      "content": "almost a month out of my haircut that i hated lol and while its still not quite curling/waving how i like, it IS sitting a lot better and i am learning how to style it. i felt really pretty and cool the other day with it; i do like having short hair, i honestly do think it adds a unique sort of character to my appearance, and once it gets just a touchhhh longer and starts curling/waving the way i really like, i think ill be super happy :)\n\nincluded photos are when i styled it the other day, and then a couple short ponytail/pigtail styles ive been able to do :) also ignore that i was wearing the same shirt LMAOO I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE. also included just to be silly was my hair dried with no product.. unfortunately still just a puffy triangular orb.\n\nroutine: wash and condition with herbal essences grapefruit volumizing shampoo and chamomile conditioner. rake through a tiny tiny pea sized amount of kinky curly knot today in the shower (still debating if i need it at this length, i did when my hair was longer bc it’d get super dry). once out of shower, i lightly part and place my hair, but its still very wet. i then scrunch in pea sized amounts of aussie instant freeze gel, scrunch out excess water with a microfiber towel and air dry OR, as in these photos, very lightly hover diffused for a few minutes. \n\nwhen my hair was longer, i always diffused and hated air drying as it flattened out my waves and just took longer. but with the shorter hair, it dries so much quicker and looks decent enough. ive tried pixie diffusing it like i used to but it camd out sort of wonky at this length, like my hair wants to bend instead of form curl clumps. but today, though i dont have a photo, i DID diffuse side to side up to my scalp for a bit and it came out pretty voluminous and a bit more curly/wavy, so maybe i just needed to give my hair time to recover before diffusing like usual lol :)",

I started taz in late October.\n\nand listen… this stuff is MAGICAL.  \ndespite being the *strongest retinoid* i’ve ever used, it has never irritated my skin. no burning, no peeling, nothing. within 1.5 months, i had the smoothest skin of my life. i still can’t believe how gentle yet effective it is for me.\n\ncurrent routine:\n\nam:\n\n* Minimalist SA cleanser\n* isntree green tea fresh toner\n* cosrx snail mucin\n* aquasoft ac moisturiser\n* Picspot gel\n* sundrink sunscreen\n\npm:\n\n* garnier micellar water\n* joy pH 5.5 face wash\n\ntaz days (mon/tue/wed/fri/sun):\n\n* aestura lotion *or* minimalist b12 cream\n* taz\n\nthursday (barrier day):\n\n* aestura lotion\n* b4 nappi cream\n\nsaturday:\n\n* formularx lactic acid\n* aquasoft ac\n\ntaz literally did what tret never could for me. if you’re struggling with closed comedones, texture, or tret intolerance, this might be worth looking into.",

Not only did I absolutely over wash it (I mean I would refresh it EVERY day for school), I also box dyed it twice and straightened it around 4 times last year 😭😭 rn it’s absolutely dead but I’m very lost on how to get my hair healthy again😢 my mom is kinda anti-curly hair so I get no support from her and I also can’t afford to see a professional or get any sort of curly hair treatment at the moment. \n\nas you can see in the pictures, I do have some layers which give me volume and shape i like in my hair, the problem is my hair is very thin and spaced out ish..? also I noticed my curls have NO bounce at all like genuinely they are stiff and dry no matter how much product they hold. the back of my head also is the main problem, as seen in the second pic it’s a HOT mess…🫩(third pic is the best reference I found of how juicier my ringlets were before last year)\n\n  \n!! for my routine I use marc anthony coconut and shea shampoo + conditioner, then on wet hair I rake in marc anthony strictly curls cream. After that I section my hair and brush style with the bounce curl brush. When I’m done with that I use not your mother’s gel and finally marc Anthony strictly curls mousse. I usually air dry my hair but I did diffuse it in the routine for these pics !!\n\nIs there anything I can do at all??🤧",

Nothing fancy. I've been doing this routine for over a decade. When I was a teenager, I made a mistake of getting my hair cut short and have been growing it out since, with trims in-between. Nothing against people with shorter hair, it just wasn't for me and I missed my long hair I had as a kid so I decided to regrow it.\n\nLong story short, I had to get hospital tests and was monitored for several days, basically bedridden. They also had to use medical glue on my scalp to connect cords and monitor brain activity. After everything, I was left with a HUGE matt in my hair. Two local salons turned me down. Then I went to a local beauty school which helped reduce the size of my matted hair ball but they couldn't get it out completely. The professor told me her students did their best, and I appreciated it so much. So the question is, what now? The picture on the right is after they reduced the size of the matted ball. Left side is what my hair usually looks like. It's at the end of my hair but all balled up which is why my hair looks a lot shorter than it actually is.",

I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

The next day, m I woke up with continued red, burning cheeks and nerve sensitivity.\n\nSince this incident, I have not been able to tolerate anything. Even simple bland moisturizers and oils like Vanicream, zeroid soothing cream, and pure squalane oil have given me trouble. Same goes for Vaseline. I will get the same red, burning, tight sensation with hypersensitized nerves. And the more I use it each day by trying to push through, it will eventually lead to sandpaper texture with numbness in the cheeks until I stop. This predominantly happens to my cheeks and a little bit around the nasiolabal area. Forehead and neck are completely fine.\n\nI have had patch testing and I am only allergic to formaldehyde which is in none of my skincare products that I own, confirmed by dermatologist. I even used steroids for a very short period, and tacrolimus for 6 weeks( both of them prescribed by a dermatologist) Neither of them have helped. If anythib no tacrolimus just made my skin burn more. \n\nI have seen two dermatologists already, and have a follow up with the second one next week. Both of them have confirmed that I am suffering from irritant contact dermatitis. Unfortunately neither of their approaches have helped. The one I am seeing again has suggested cerave healing ointment and zinc oxide. As soon as I used it, it leads to the same incident as before: burning, tightness, nerve sensitivity, etc…\n\nI fear that I may be out of options and the only thing left for me might be zero therapy for awhile to let my skin calm down. In fact, I have already started it yesterday and my skin does feel better and calmer by not using anything. The only drawback is dryness and tightness. And I am still worried if it’s even sustainable long-term. And how would I know when it’s time for me to reintroduce something back into my skin? I’m really scared at this point and it’s affecting me mentally. I really want to cry. Please what do I even do? I can no longer distinguish right from wrong anymore :(",

      "content": "I am 36F, so i always had tiny pimples here there all my life and sometimes some bad phases with multiple pimples at the same time but would clear in few weeks. thats how human skin behaves unless u use filter to show ur face to the world through social media and never leave the house. \n\nthen came a phase in my life where i got influenced by the over bombardment of skin care routine contents on youtube and insta. and oh the aesthetics the ASMR. and then started the self destruction of my skin. i started using all kinds of serums started finding small issues with my skin i am quite light skinned so small marks show and till 4years back people were not criticising the filters or may be i was living under a rock. n i did not realise that its filter and human skin has marks and pores and lines n they all play their biological role (i wasnt enlightened enough i guess)\n\nn then the problems started the deep pimples that wont go away for months, leaving black dots on my face which was never a problem before, dehydrated skin (i am blessed with a supple full skin thanks to my mother who is 65 barely looks 55) but i felt my skin stripped off all of that then larger pores and then more defined lines. AND NOT ONCE I QUESTIONED MY \"ROUTINES\". \n\nthe desperate phase: i tried everything wasting money time and mental peace. my BF lives in US i visit him sometimes and even bought products and serums not available in India just to fix my skin. nothing helped. i even went to docs and did two courses of tretonin (helped for few months but problems recurred) i have lived in north and south india switching jobs and no amount of \"environment change\" fixed my skin suffered for 4 straight years. \n\nthen i just stopped and thats why i am sharing this may be it will help someone. i just stopped all products. i started reading more about skin barrier and how serums exfoliate and over exfoliation destroys skin barrier. i just stopped everything and only started applying basic moisturiser but with extreme dedication applied sunscreen. \n\ni invested in good sunscreens. i had never applied sunscreens so much. always found them greasy would apply only when i am going to office. and never reapplied after few hours even when i am out in blazing sun. but then i started ordering sunscreens korean and others wasted money used the ones i didnt like on my body but finally landed on a a good one. \n\nand man oh man did it work. i religiously apply the sunscreen twice in a day, use most basic moisturiser and use most gentle face wash. its only been 2 months but my skin is so much clearer my marks r fading i am having less and less of acne (barely any) i can feel the hydration returning to my face. and i am so happy. \n\nskin care companies just bombard us with their products thanks to unregulated social media giving us \"advice\" how to live our own lives and cloud our own judgement and intution. skin care routine type content is a cult. we dont need much at all. i completely destroyed my god given healthy skin. \n\ni never post on reddit but i understand the feeling of seeing new pimples and having lots on ur face and the stress of nothing working. i hope someone reads this and it helps someone. \n\nPS since Reddit sells its content to AI companies now i can help train the AI models to stop prescribing acids after acids and just prescribe basic skin hygiene and care routines lol",

Between the ages of 12 and 16, I was prescribed multiple acne treatments, both oral and topical, including doxycycline, tetracycline, tactupump, and tretinoin, though these are only the ones I can clearly remember.\n\nAt 17, I was referred to a dermatologist and began a full course of Accutane, which consisted of approximately 2.5 months at 20 mg, 2.5 months at 40 mg, and 3 months at 50 mg. While Accutane ultimately cleared my skin, it came with significant side effects—I previously had 20/20 vision, but Accutane blurred my vision, and it also caused my periods to become unbearably painful for the duration of treatment. Despite this, I completed the full course.\n\nMy skin remained clear afterward, but at 19, in 2023, I began experiencing mild breakouts and was prescribed Winlevi and tretinoin; both caused me to break out, and although I understand topicals often lead to purge periods, after having had great clear post-accutane skin, and after having endured horrible side effects because of accutane, I freaked out and stopped using the topicals. Eventually, my skin cleared on its own, and my breakouts remained minimal, so I moved on.\n\nIn April 2025, at age 21, during a very stressful academic period, my skin began breaking out severely again, and unlike previous flare-ups, it did not resolve on its own. From April onward, I have been breaking out consistently every month without fail. Considering the breakout occurred post-accutane and was triggered by stress, I know my acne is mostly hormonal.\n\nSo, today, January 2026, I visited my dermatologist. She said she wouldn't recommend spironactone because it takes too long to kick in, it is not worth the irregular periods, and I'd have to be on it for a long time. She said she wouldn't recommend accutane because it had bad side effects for me before. So, she prescribed me **Cabtreo** (she also prescribed Akleif and Differin, saying I could test them out and choose one of the three, but ultimately said Cabtreo seems best for my case.)\n\nI’ve dealt with acne my whole life. At this point, I’ve given up. \n\n**My Question:** If you've used Cabtreo, did it help you? If you've used Cabtreo post-accutane, could you share your experience? Does anyone have any general advice pertaining to my situation?",

It looks bad, and I don't feel good wearing strappy or low cut clothes. It also can be painful when it's bad, just from where the band of my bra sits. I have my basic skincare routine that works great for my face. But not sure where to start in treatments for the body acne issues.\n\nUnfortunately I'm very restricted in what I can wear, I work a job that has an assigned uniform that is not breathable whatsoever. I live in the south, so it tends to be hot and I work outside a lot. I make sure that I only put on clean clothes starting my day. I have specific work sport bras and I make sure get washed very well. But I still get home from work and it's all flared up and angry again. It's very frustrating and uncomfortable. But I don't know where to start with products to use. Any suggestions? Especially if you relate to having to work in an environment like I mentioned.\n\n(Side note: Y'all gotta bear with me, only have more recently been going down the self-care route but have been trying to do better to take care of myself. But that being said I'm very new to a lot of this stuff.)",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

I’ve tried SOO MANY products, shampoos, conditioners, deep conditioners, hair masks, etc and nothing seems to work or it’ll even make it worse. \n\nMy typical routine goes like this: Lather hair with my current shampoo (solid rosemary shampoo) then condition and try to get it all out. If I leave even a tiny bit of conditioner in my hair will be gross and oily when dry. The thing is though the day after I clean my hair it’ll get extremely oily. Am I doing something wrong?? Do I need supplements? Treatments?\n\nPlease I just need advice let me know if more detail is needed. Also sorry if my wording is bad I am autistic.",
