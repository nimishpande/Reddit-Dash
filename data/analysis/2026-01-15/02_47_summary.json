      "content": "almost a month out of my haircut that i hated lol and while its still not quite curling/waving how i like, it IS sitting a lot better and i am learning how to style it. i felt really pretty and cool the other day with it; i do like having short hair, i honestly do think it adds a unique sort of character to my appearance, and once it gets just a touchhhh longer and starts curling/waving the way i really like, i think ill be super happy :)\n\nincluded photos are when i styled it the other day, and then a couple short ponytail/pigtail styles ive been able to do :) also ignore that i was wearing the same shirt LMAOO I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE. also included just to be silly was my hair dried with no product.. unfortunately still just a puffy triangular orb.\n\nroutine: wash and condition with herbal essences grapefruit volumizing shampoo and chamomile conditioner. rake through a tiny tiny pea sized amount of kinky curly knot today in the shower (still debating if i need it at this length, i did when my hair was longer bc it’d get super dry). once out of shower, i lightly part and place my hair, but its still very wet. i then scrunch in pea sized amounts of aussie instant freeze gel, scrunch out excess water with a microfiber towel and air dry OR, as in these photos, very lightly hover diffused for a few minutes. \n\nwhen my hair was longer, i always diffused and hated air drying as it flattened out my waves and just took longer. but with the shorter hair, it dries so much quicker and looks decent enough. ive tried pixie diffusing it like i used to but it camd out sort of wonky at this length, like my hair wants to bend instead of form curl clumps. but today, though i dont have a photo, i DID diffuse side to side up to my scalp for a bit and it came out pretty voluminous and a bit more curly/wavy, so maybe i just needed to give my hair time to recover before diffusing like usual lol :)",

I started taz in late October.\n\nand listen… this stuff is MAGICAL.  \ndespite being the *strongest retinoid* i’ve ever used, it has never irritated my skin. no burning, no peeling, nothing. within 1.5 months, i had the smoothest skin of my life. i still can’t believe how gentle yet effective it is for me.\n\ncurrent routine:\n\nam:\n\n* Minimalist SA cleanser\n* isntree green tea fresh toner\n* cosrx snail mucin\n* aquasoft ac moisturiser\n* Picspot gel\n* sundrink sunscreen\n\npm:\n\n* garnier micellar water\n* joy pH 5.5 face wash\n\ntaz days (mon/tue/wed/fri/sun):\n\n* aestura lotion *or* minimalist b12 cream\n* taz\n\nthursday (barrier day):\n\n* aestura lotion\n* b4 nappi cream\n\nsaturday:\n\n* formularx lactic acid\n* aquasoft ac\n\ntaz literally did what tret never could for me. if you’re struggling with closed comedones, texture, or tret intolerance, this might be worth looking into.",

      "content": "For years I was incredibly insecure about my skin. I suffered with adult acne and Hyperpigmentation since around 2013 and I felt like it was making my life miserable. My Mom eventually suggested I get a chemical peel (surprise, that didn’t work). It wasn’t until 2019 that I really started investing into my skin. I started using a toner and glycolic acid pads. Within a few weeks I started to notice my skin getting back to its brighter, even tone. Not to mention my acne started to fade away as I continued to use them.\n\nNowadays the only thing I use is Cerave’s Hydrating Facial Cleanser and that works for me. I’m only posting this to say that if you’re having struggles with your acne that the fight won’t last forever. You’ll also get to exactly where you wanna be in time😌",

After that I section my hair and brush style with the bounce curl brush. When I’m done with that I use not your mother’s gel and finally marc Anthony strictly curls mousse. I usually air dry my hair but I did diffuse it in the routine for these pics !!\n\nIs there anything I can do at all??🤧",

I was unfortunate enough to have a big head, look hideous bald and \"just shave it\" didn't seem like an option i wanted to take!\n\nDecided to go down the Transplant route! Transplant done in Turkey at HLC in Ankara in October 2022! Piggybacked off a Europe trip i was already going on! The Transplant itself came to about $10k Aud back in Oct 2022. Cant remember how many grafts they did, but it was a lot.\n\nWent through the lot. The transplant, the sleeping upright, the swollen face, the long haul flights, the ugly duckling stage, the regrowth and then the full head of hair!\n\n1st photo: October 2020 (I was 26 years old)\n\n2nd photo: December 2020\n\n3rd-6th photo: October 2022 (Taken at HLC)\n\n7th-8th photo: July 2023\n\n9th-10th photo: February 2024\n\n11th photo: December 2025! Got engaged!\n\nWas taking minoxidil (1ml 5% topical) before the transplant for about 2 years though was not taking finasteride. Started taking finasteride 3 months before transplant and have been taking since. Finasteride: 1mg daily. \n\nHonestly the best decision of my life (until the engagement of course). I only wear hats now for their intended use, sun safety. Otherwise its flowing free.\n\nThat being said, thinking of everyone going through the hair loss shit daily! I know how it feels, and i know its shit.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

AND NOT ONCE I QUESTIONED MY \"ROUTINES\". \n\nthe desperate phase: i tried everything wasting money time and mental peace. my BF lives in US i visit him sometimes and even bought products and serums not available in India just to fix my skin. nothing helped. i even went to docs and did two courses of tretonin (helped for few months but problems recurred) i have lived in north and south india switching jobs and no amount of \"environment change\" fixed my skin suffered for 4 straight years. \n\nthen i just stopped and thats why i am sharing this may be it will help someone. i just stopped all products. i started reading more about skin barrier and how serums exfoliate and over exfoliation destroys skin barrier. i just stopped everything and only started applying basic moisturiser but with extreme dedication applied sunscreen. \n\ni invested in good sunscreens. i had never applied sunscreens so much. always found them greasy would apply only when i am going to office. and never reapplied after few hours even when i am out in blazing sun. but then i started ordering sunscreens korean and others wasted money used the ones i didnt like on my body but finally landed on a a good one. \n\nand man oh man did it work. i religiously apply the sunscreen twice in a day, use most basic moisturiser and use most gentle face wash. its only been 2 months but my skin is so much clearer my marks r fading i am having less and less of acne (barely any) i can feel the hydration returning to my face. and i am so happy. \n\nskin care companies just bombard us with their products thanks to unregulated social media giving us \"advice\" how to live our own lives and cloud our own judgement and intution. skin care routine type content is a cult. we dont need much at all. i completely destroyed my god given healthy skin. \n\ni never post on reddit but i understand the feeling of seeing new pimples and having lots on ur face and the stress of nothing working. i hope someone reads this and it helps someone. \n\nPS since Reddit sells its content to AI companies now i can help train the AI models to stop prescribing acids after acids and just prescribe basic skin hygiene and care routines lol",

I have a beard that I need to keep, I have some acne under there but of course it’s not super visible.\n\nI don’t understand how I’m getting acne though. I’m very hygienic, I cleanse 1-2 times a day with 4% benzoyl peroxide, use a light chemical exfoliant a few times a week, and use some nice moisturizer. I wash my beard more than twice a day. I shower once or twice a day.\n\n \n\nPlease let me know if you have any advice, it would be a huge help. Feel free to ask me to elaborate on anything as well!",

      "title": "2 months | 30M | Topical finasteride/minoxidil",
      "content": "Hello Tressless. Long time reader, first time poster. \n\n**TL;DR:** If you struggled with oral finasteride side effects and are considering topical, I’d recommend taking a shot. (Consult your doctor too). \n\nWanted to share my experience with Topical finasteride/minoxidil spray. Mainly sharing because my hair has been somewhat of a point of sadness for me over the past 2-3 years. I was especially sad when I reacted poorly to the oral finasteride, showed no gains on topical minoxidil and as result felt hopeless to my genetic fate. So, as I think I’ve now found something that works for me, when all hope was lost - it felt only right to share in case others are in a similar situation. Happy to answer all and any questions. \n\nSee pictures attached, taken approximately 2 months apart. My hair loss has always been worse on one-side (barely noticeable on the other). There has been marginal recession, mainly just density loss on this side - however I’ve noticed my hairline also progress slightly forward. By no means the finished article, but happy with the short-term results and excited for what the future holds. \n\nOnly regret is that I didn’t start sooner when I was in denial at around age 28. \n\n**Side effects:** \n\n1. Slight libido loss for around the first month and it has since returned to normal in the last couple of weeks. \n\n2. No other sides. \n\n**Questions:** \n\n1. How would you rate my progress? \n\n2. Admittedly, I am a bit confused by my gains. I read somewhere that hair progress works in 3-month cycles. How is it possible to have noticeable hair growth in 2 months? \n\n3. Has anyone else suffered with hair loss on just one side? I assume it’s because it’s the side I sleep on but it’s always been thinner on that side so could just be a natural density thing. \n\n**Topical solution ingredients:** \n\n1. 0.1% finasteride \n\n2. 7.5% minoxidil \n\n3. Melatonin \n\n4. Caffeine \n\n5. Fluocinolone acetonide\n\nHappy to share details of where I get my topical for those interested. \n\n**Important points of context:** \n\n1. First noticed hair loss at around age 26. Had a very bad case of Telogen Effluvium after getting fairly sick from Covid. Hair density returned to 85% pre-Covid and then gradually declined (likely from MPB and not TE). \n\n2. I took 0.5mg oral finasteride every second day for approx 2 months last year (started around Mar ‘25) and experienced pretty bad sexual side effects. Quickly stopped. \n\n3. I was using minoxidil 5% for almost 9 months (started Jan ‘25) without any results before switching to the topical finasteride/minoxidil. I think the tretinoin/minoxidl in the new solution definitely helped gains.\n\n4. I have also made some slight gains on the crown however this was not bad to begin with (didn’t take pics).\n\n5. My diet has been very clean for the past 2 years, eating mainly whole foods and limiting alcohol consumption to twice per month. \n\n6. I started a new training routine, hitting the gym 4 times per week and lifting heavy since Ju",
