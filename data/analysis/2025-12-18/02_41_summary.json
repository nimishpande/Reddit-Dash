      "content": "I just started trying to take care of my hair texture about 2 weeks ago and I stopped abusing it with flat irons and bleach/color recently but as my title suggests I’m way out of my depth, I was never taught how to take care of my hair properly, only chemical processing and heat styling since I was 8 and I only recently learned my hair type was not what I thought it was. Basically any tips, tricks, or advice from anyone here that has the same or similar hair type as me or anyone familiar with working with my hair type would be much appreciated.\n\nPhoto #1 was before I quit the constant bleaching and hair dye \n\nPhoto #2 is day one trying to bring out the curls \n\nPhotos #3 &amp; #4 are from today \n\nClearly something is happening cuz it’s curling’s heck of a lot more than when I started but I also am not feeling very confident with my natural hair texture so far and feel like I’m doing something wrong. \n\nMy routine currently is using the not your mothers curl talk line \n\nIn the shower:\n\n\\-I wash my hair/scalp every 3-4 days with NYM curl talk bond repair shampoo. About a half dollar amount\n\n\\- then I use the NYM curl talk 3 in 1 conditioner. About a quarter size amount \n\nAfter shower: \n\n\\- I apply NYM curl talk leave in conditioner (just a 2-3 spritz).\n\n\\- then I follow with about a golf ball amount of NYM curl talk mousse and scrunch it in once I work it thru my hair. \n\n\\- lastly I use a dime size of NYM curl talk sculpting gel and work it thru my hair and scrunch with a cotton t-shirt once dry I re-scrunch out the crunchy bits. \n\nRefresh days: a half dollar size of mousse on damp hair, re-scrunch, let dry then I scrunch out any crunchy bits. \n\nI try to diffuse on low heat when I have the energy but I get dizzy holding my arms up so long so I tend to air dry most days, and I do sleep with a silk pillow case (I don’t use bonnets because don’t like the sensory of something on my head while I sleep)  \n\nFor additional relevant detail/context, I have fine hair, medium density and high porosity.",

He only prescribed me a ketoconazole shampoo and did not advise me in any way. I have a few questions:\n\n* How can I be sure that it is seborrheic dermatitis or ringworm?\n* I don’t believe it is incurable, as I’ve heard of some people who were able to find a solution; maybe it is just not widely known. I’d like to hear what worked for people here who were able to permanently cure their seborrheic dermatitis. What products did you use and what routines did you follow? By “permanently cured,” I mean in remission with no maintenance required; once it was gone, you didn’t have to keep using the products that cured it, and do not have flare-ups anymore. I prefer natural remedies, but would still like to hear from those who had success with manufactured shampoos and creams, because I know they can sometimes be more effective.\n\nHe also said that I have rosacea (he said it could also be seborrheic dermatitis) and that it is once again incurable. It was my first time seeing him and I am planning on switching to a different dermatologist because in addition to him not being able to properly diagnose me, he acted miserable, like he did not want to be there, and rushed me so I was unable to get help with other dermatological issues I wanted to bring up. He only prescribed me a cream and did not advise me in any way on how to care for my skin and alleviate any symptoms that may come along with rosacea (or seborrheic dermatitis).\n\nA few things in the meantime:\n\n* Is there any testing that can be done to confirm what is causing the redness and flakiness on my skin?\n* I’d also like to hear what worked for people here who were able to permanently cure their rosacea.

I unfortunately had a MRSA infection on my nose in September, this + cephelaxin (wrongly prescribed antibiotic) destroyed my skin and left me with dermatitis around my mouth. it got way worse into November/december, breaking my entire skin barrier out in a rosacea like rash irritation all over my face. My acne has also gotten a bit worse, but it’s not my overall concern. In this time I’ve done zero therapy, all the dermatitis recommendations, azelic acid, metro gel etc. right now I’m just using vanicream face wash and BABY vanicream lotion. I stopped using the AA in hopes to help my skin relax and I was using LP cicaplast, which definitely calms the redness but gives me super agitated pores so I’m thinking of just using it once a week. I apply tret once a week prior to this whole experience, but can’t anymore bc of how sensitive my skin is. I don’t use any other actives and never have. Does anyone have any recommendations for me during this time? Sorry that was ALOT. Thank you !\n\nForgot to mention: I am currently on doxycyline for the dermatitis as well! ",

      "content": "have been on 1mg fin since january of 2023 and was on topical min from february of 2023 to august of 2024, saw amazing progress like all of my hair grew back. i then switched to oral min in august of 2024 (5mg) as it was getting annoying applying topical min to longer hair as well as concerns with a cat. I lost some of my gains but in retrospect i should’ve stayed on it and my hair looked great still. So in april of 2025 i switched back to topical min( grave mistake) as i thought the oral min was making me lose all my hair, i then went on to shed soooo much hair and realized you really can’t be on topical if you have pets as you will be stressing about it all the time. in mid july i switched back to oral min and my hair has not been growing back. at a loss of what to do and wish i never screwed with my stack. don’t know if i should hop on dut or go for a transplant, can’t tell if my hair is still minituarizing or if it’s just a minoxidil shed. \n\nit’s insane to me how i grew all of my hair back and hair loss was out of my head for so long and now it’s at the forefront again\n\nat a loss of what to do right now it’s been basically 5 months back on oral min and i don’t see any ré growth is happening or it’s hard to tell and i also feel like in the back of my head that the fin isn’t working, any of you guys have a story similar to this?",

But let's be real, sometimes we break a \"rule\" and our skin is like... thank you for that.\n\nI'll start: I stopped over-layering actives and suddenly my skin cleared up. No fancy 10-step routine, no daily acids, just cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen. The glow??? Unexpected.\n\nSo now I'm curious-  \nWhat's one skincare rule you ignored and your skin actually thrived because of it?  \nDid u stop using toner? Skip vitamin C? Use moisturizer on oily skin and realize it wasn't the enemy?\n\nLet's normalize doing what works for your skin and not what Instagram yells at us 💅✨",

I managed to clear it up and experience smooth healthy skin for a year or 2 in my early 20s, just be using a consistent skin care routine that mainly worked to heal my skin barrier. \n\nAnyways, this is where im at now. It's been consistently this bad for about a month. I think I over used my hypochlorous acid spray and it broke me out. so ive been trying to heal my skin barrier again, and switched from Skin 1004 products to a line up of just 3 products to keep it simple. I've been using Tatcha dewy face cleanser daily am &amp; pm, FAB hydrating dewy gel cream daily am &amp; pm, Biossance squalane + ectoin over ight rescue every second or third night. If my skin barrier is improving, I cant really tell besides the fact that im at least not getting cystic spots anymore. My skin seems congested, I've developed very bumpy skin. New pustules everyday. Im combination oily dry skin. Pretty sure hormones play a role and im working on slowly being able to heal internally but its a process for me. my skin is also very sensitive and using salicylic acid or other actives can break me out easily. \n\nI just dont know what to doooooo. I'm gonna try seeing a derm again, but spiro didnt work for me, im not willing to take acutane, tetracycline/doxycycline make me ill. birth control is out of the question. ive tried 2 rounds of clindamycin a year apart and it helps but isnt a permanent fix. i have no idea what products i should be using to fix this and thats where id like to start bc getting to see the derm is very difficult for me currently. \n\nhow do i figure out what products im suppose to be using? the amount of money ive dumped into skincare that didnt work over the last few years is disheartening. please tell me what i should do, i beg. thank you",
