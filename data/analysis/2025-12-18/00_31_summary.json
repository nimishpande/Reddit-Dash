She recommended to get bloodwork done to check if i have some kind of iron or vitamin defiency but i was wondering if there’s supplements or products that could help in the meanwhile before i can get an appointment?

My current routine is extremely simple — I just use La Roche-Posay Hydrating Gentle Cleanser and Toleriane Double Face Moisturizer UV. Those are great basics, but I know it’s very minimal.\n\nMy skin is pretty sensitive, and a lot of products I’ve tried in the past gave me acne or irritation. I’m 25, male, and my skin is generally in good condition — but I want to start taking skincare more seriously before aging signs start to show.\n\nI’ve heard a lot about Korean skincare being great for hydration and anti-aging, and that’s one of my main focuses now.\n\nSo I’m hoping to get some recommendations on:\n\t•\tCore products to add (Asian/K-beauty or otherwise) that are good for sensitive, combination skin\n\t•\tAnti-aging options that are gentle\n\t•\tProducts that won’t clog pores or cause breakouts\n\t•\tAny routine structure tips (what to use morning vs night)\n\nThanks in advance — really appreciate any help! 😊",

So I have less breakouts.\n\nI also use two prescription meds- Sulfacetamide and Clindamycin- which help reduce acne from the outside. With these, my acne is essentially gone.\n\nHowever, my skin is super scarred from a decade of severe breakouts (not yay) and terribly dry from all my medication. I also use hydroquinone, a skin bleaching agent for the scars. It says I need to wear really good sun protection and reapply so my skin doesn’t burn and re-scar.\n\n1.\t⁠What SPF should I be using? (I have dark skin so no cast, please!)\n2.\t⁠What products would you recommend to add maximum crazy moisture? Any that are safe to use with my meds?\n3.\t⁠Should I be exfoliating? Logically, I should be regularly as the skin regrows and the scarred layer falls off, right?\n4. I should be using a benzoyl peroxide product with the clindamycin. Any that you guys recommend?\n\nThank you guys so much! &lt;3",

      "content": "Hi all :) I’m here to ask for some advice. To give you some background info: in 2024 I had quite bad acne, a dermatologist prescribed me some creams to treat it, unfortunately they were quite harsh and destroyed my skin barrier. My skin was completely red, dry, leathery feeling for a few months, it was really bad. This was in November 2024. Since then, it has slowly improved, I have been using delicate face washes like Roche posay toleriane products and the toleriane fluid cream too. Many other products weren’t really tolerated by my skin. After a year, my skin is now feeling smooth and normal again, I’m not completely red anymore. I do however still have fragile and delicate skin, the central part of my face, like the cheeks or the forehead still have some lingering redness, they feel dry easily even if I try to moisturise as much as possible, and they are quite reactive to cold or heat.\n\nI would like to ask for advise here, if someone had similar situations, what product helped them bring their skin back to a strong and good looking state? :) I like the toleriane fluid and it helped me get out of that nightmare situation I was in, but I feel like it does not “feed” my skin enough and I feel like after the big improvement there has been so far, now the situation is a little stuck.\n\nAlso, here are some pictures of before (November 2024) and of now. I guess it’s good to remember how far I’ve come overall.\n\nThank you to all that will comment :)",
