I’d really appreciate some guidance from people who’ve actually been through this.\n\nShort background:\nGrowing up, I didn’t really take care of my skin  lots of sun exposure, stress, and inconsistent habits. Over time, my face became darker and uneven compared to my hands/legs, which still look closer to my original skin tone.\nNow I’m fixing things slowly and properly.\n\n(I’m also posting a leg photo for reference so you can see the tone difference.)\n\nCurrent routine (doctor recommended):\n\nGentle face wash\n\nBrightening / depigmentation serum\n\nBarrier-repair moisturizer\n\nSunscreen (this is where I need help)\n\n\nMy skin type:\nNormal to sensitive. Not naturally oily, but some products make my skin look shiny.\n\nMain question (sunscreen):\nWhich would be better for my skin?\n\n1. La Shield Lite SPF 40+ PA+++\n\n\n2.

Basically any tips, tricks, or advice from anyone here that has the same or similar hair type as me or anyone familiar with working with my hair type would be much appreciated.\n\nPhoto #1 was before I quit the constant bleaching and hair dye \n\nPhoto #2 is day one trying to bring out the curls \n\nPhotos #3 &amp; #4 are from today \n\nClearly something is happening cuz it’s curling’s heck of a lot more than when I started but I also am not feeling very confident with my natural hair texture so far and feel like I’m doing something wrong. \n\nMy routine currently is using the not your mothers curl talk line \n\nIn the shower:\n\n\\-I wash my hair/scalp every 3-4 days with NYM curl talk bond repair shampoo. About a half dollar amount\n\n\\- then I use the NYM curl talk 3 in 1 conditioner. About a quarter size amount \n\nAfter shower: \n\n\\- I apply NYM curl talk leave in conditioner (just a 2-3 spritz).\n\n\\- then I follow with about a golf ball amount of NYM curl talk mousse and scrunch it in once I work it thru my hair. \n\n\\- lastly I use a dime size of NYM curl talk sculpting gel and work it thru my hair and scrunch with a cotton t-shirt once dry I re-scrunch out the crunchy bits. \n\nRefresh days: a half dollar size of mousse on damp hair, re-scrunch, let dry then I scrunch out any crunchy bits. \n\nI try to diffuse on low heat when I have the energy but I get dizzy holding my arms up so long so I tend to air dry most days, and I do sleep with a silk pillow case (I don’t use bonnets because don’t like the sensory of something on my head while I sleep)  \n\nFor additional relevant detail/context, I have fine hair, medium density and high porosity.",

It’s not painful but remains inflamed and darker than the rest of my skin. I had a cortisone injection a little over 3 weeks ago, which reduced the size, but it’s filling up again.\n\nHas anyone dealt with recurring cysts in the same spot multiple times? Any advice for preventing them from coming back after injection or other treatments that have worked for you?\n\nI’m planning to schedule another appointment soon, but I’d love to hear about your experiences.

      "content": "have been on 1mg fin since january of 2023 and was on topical min from february of 2023 to august of 2024, saw amazing progress like all of my hair grew back. i then switched to oral min in august of 2024 (5mg) as it was getting annoying applying topical min to longer hair as well as concerns with a cat. I lost some of my gains but in retrospect i should’ve stayed on it and my hair looked great still. So in april of 2025 i switched back to topical min( grave mistake) as i thought the oral min was making me lose all my hair, i then went on to shed soooo much hair and realized you really can’t be on topical if you have pets as you will be stressing about it all the time. in mid july i switched back to oral min and my hair has not been growing back. at a loss of what to do and wish i never screwed with my stack. don’t know if i should hop on dut or go for a transplant, can’t tell if my hair is still minituarizing or if it’s just a minoxidil shed. \n\nit’s insane to me how i grew all of my hair back and hair loss was out of my head for so long and now it’s at the forefront again\n\nat a loss of what to do right now it’s been basically 5 months back on oral min and i don’t see any ré growth is happening or it’s hard to tell and i also feel like in the back of my head that the fin isn’t working, any of you guys have a story similar to this?",

For context, I struggle with adult acne pretty bad but it’s even worse when I use the SA cleanser. I usually use a goat milk bar soap or a korean PH balanced gentle foam cleanser, neither of which breaks me out or dries out my skin.. BUT my skin still feels like it has dead skin on it that easily rubs off when I rub it with my fingers.\n\nI don’t know what to do! My skin is so sensitive and produces a lot of oil and flakey skin.

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
