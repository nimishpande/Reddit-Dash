      "content": "This has been happening for years and I’ve never been able to find an answer as to what these are. These dots appear on my face, I can wipe them off with anything absorbent (usually cotton pads) and minimal pressure, to which there’ll be little black/blue dots on whatever I used. I can usually feel them forming/coming out; it feels like liquid being secreted from my pores, but it just kind of sits there and never drips at all. It doesn’t come out unless I wash my face or wipe them off. They get worse when I wear “base” makeup (concealer, blush, etc.) and when I do any physical activity. I thought maybe it was the eyeliner I wear causing it, but it happens even when I don’t wear much/any eyeliner. There have also been times where I’ve worn a full face of makeup and they haven’t appeared, though that it rare. What could this be? How do I prevent it? I can’t ever find anything about them online. At their worst, they look like fake clown freckles drawn with black eyeliner.",

Basically any tips, tricks, or advice from anyone here that has the same or similar hair type as me or anyone familiar with working with my hair type would be much appreciated.\n\nPhoto #1 was before I quit the constant bleaching and hair dye \n\nPhoto #2 is day one trying to bring out the curls \n\nPhotos #3 &amp; #4 are from today \n\nClearly something is happening cuz it’s curling’s heck of a lot more than when I started but I also am not feeling very confident with my natural hair texture so far and feel like I’m doing something wrong. \n\nMy routine currently is using the not your mothers curl talk line \n\nIn the shower:\n\n\\-I wash my hair/scalp every 3-4 days with NYM curl talk bond repair shampoo. About a half dollar amount\n\n\\- then I use the NYM curl talk 3 in 1 conditioner. About a quarter size amount \n\nAfter shower: \n\n\\- I apply NYM curl talk leave in conditioner (just a 2-3 spritz).\n\n\\- then I follow with about a golf ball amount of NYM curl talk mousse and scrunch it in once I work it thru my hair. \n\n\\- lastly I use a dime size of NYM curl talk sculpting gel and work it thru my hair and scrunch with a cotton t-shirt once dry I re-scrunch out the crunchy bits. \n\nRefresh days: a half dollar size of mousse on damp hair, re-scrunch, let dry then I scrunch out any crunchy bits. \n\nI try to diffuse on low heat when I have the energy but I get dizzy holding my arms up so long so I tend to air dry most days, and I do sleep with a silk pillow case (I don’t use bonnets because don’t like the sensory of something on my head while I sleep)  \n\nFor additional relevant detail/context, I have fine hair, medium density and high porosity.",

(I have no problem with that)..\n\nThe REASON I ask is because having a full wash routine has become very hard and too daunting to me 😔 I feel too severely depressed and too exhausted to do it all (condition, waiting, rinsing it out ect)...\n\nIs it okay to completely SKIP conditioner &amp; hair masks? I would like to SHAMPOO TWICE and be done with it!\n\nDoes anyone else do this? \n\nThank you!\n\n",

      "content": "have been on 1mg fin since january of 2023 and was on topical min from february of 2023 to august of 2024, saw amazing progress like all of my hair grew back. i then switched to oral min in august of 2024 (5mg) as it was getting annoying applying topical min to longer hair as well as concerns with a cat. I lost some of my gains but in retrospect i should’ve stayed on it and my hair looked great still. So in april of 2025 i switched back to topical min( grave mistake) as i thought the oral min was making me lose all my hair, i then went on to shed soooo much hair and realized you really can’t be on topical if you have pets as you will be stressing about it all the time. in mid july i switched back to oral min and my hair has not been growing back. at a loss of what to do and wish i never screwed with my stack. don’t know if i should hop on dut or go for a transplant, can’t tell if my hair is still minituarizing or if it’s just a minoxidil shed. \n\nit’s insane to me how i grew all of my hair back and hair loss was out of my head for so long and now it’s at the forefront again\n\nat a loss of what to do right now it’s been basically 5 months back on oral min and i don’t see any ré growth is happening or it’s hard to tell and i also feel like in the back of my head that the fin isn’t working, any of you guys have a story similar to this?",

      "content": "I've (F28) been dealing with acne since i was like 11. I managed to clear it up and experience smooth healthy skin for a year or 2 in my early 20s, just be using a consistent skin care routine that mainly worked to heal my skin barrier. \n\nAnyways, this is where im at now. It's been consistently this bad for about a month. I think I over used my hypochlorous acid spray and it broke me out. so ive been trying to heal my skin barrier again, and switched from Skin 1004 products to a line up of just 3 products to keep it simple. I've been using Tatcha dewy face cleanser daily am &amp; pm, FAB hydrating dewy gel cream daily am &amp; pm, Biossance squalane + ectoin over ight rescue every second or third night. If my skin barrier is improving, I cant really tell besides the fact that im at least not getting cystic spots anymore. My skin seems congested, I've developed very bumpy skin. New pustules everyday. Im combination oily dry skin. Pretty sure hormones play a role and im working on slowly being able to heal internally but its a process for me. my skin is also very sensitive and using salicylic acid or other actives can break me out easily. \n\nI just dont know what to doooooo. I'm gonna try seeing a derm again, but spiro didnt work for me, im not willing to take acutane, tetracycline/doxycycline make me ill. birth control is out of the question. ive tried 2 rounds of clindamycin a year apart and it helps but isnt a permanent fix. i have no idea what products i should be using to fix this and thats where id like to start bc getting to see the derm is very difficult for me currently. \n\nhow do i figure out what products im suppose to be using? the amount of money ive dumped into skincare that didnt work over the last few years is disheartening. please tell me what i should do, i beg. thank you",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
