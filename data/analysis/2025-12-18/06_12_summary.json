Basically any tips, tricks, or advice from anyone here that has the same or similar hair type as me or anyone familiar with working with my hair type would be much appreciated.\n\nPhoto #1 was before I quit the constant bleaching and hair dye \n\nPhoto #2 is day one trying to bring out the curls \n\nPhotos #3 &amp; #4 are from today \n\nClearly something is happening cuz it’s curling’s heck of a lot more than when I started but I also am not feeling very confident with my natural hair texture so far and feel like I’m doing something wrong. \n\nMy routine currently is using the not your mothers curl talk line \n\nIn the shower:\n\n\\-I wash my hair/scalp every 3-4 days with NYM curl talk bond repair shampoo. About a half dollar amount\n\n\\- then I use the NYM curl talk 3 in 1 conditioner. About a quarter size amount \n\nAfter shower: \n\n\\- I apply NYM curl talk leave in conditioner (just a 2-3 spritz).\n\n\\- then I follow with about a golf ball amount of NYM curl talk mousse and scrunch it in once I work it thru my hair. \n\n\\- lastly I use a dime size of NYM curl talk sculpting gel and work it thru my hair and scrunch with a cotton t-shirt once dry I re-scrunch out the crunchy bits. \n\nRefresh days: a half dollar size of mousse on damp hair, re-scrunch, let dry then I scrunch out any crunchy bits. \n\nI try to diffuse on low heat when I have the energy but I get dizzy holding my arms up so long so I tend to air dry most days, and I do sleep with a silk pillow case (I don’t use bonnets because don’t like the sensory of something on my head while I sleep)  \n\nFor additional relevant detail/context, I have fine hair, medium density and high porosity.",

But the curl CTRL defining crème I find too heavy for the curls and becomes quite dry and tangled by day 2/3 and find I have to wash my hair more than I’d like to get rid of the product. 3.

It’s about medium length past my shoulders and thick. I’m not sure what my type is. My routine is shampoo/conditioner a curl can dream (the one for wavy hair). I detangle it in the shower and let it air dry once I get out.\n\nMy first problem is maintaining it. It holds waves pretty well even after a couple days, but they never look as good as they do when I wash it and let it air dry. Even if I don’t brush it the next day, it still gets really frizzy and tangly. When I do brush it, it gets even frizzier. So either way, it just doesn’t look very good after the first day. I’m not sure how to get them to hold better.\n\nMy second problem is hats. When I have breaks during the school year and over summer, my dad has me help out at his business. The requirement is that hair be up past your shoulders (in a bun since my hair is long) and you have to wear a visor. On the days I help, my hair gets flat from wearing it in a bun and I can’t figure out how to style bangs with a visor so I just tuck them in. I’ve tried tips from Google, and even my mom has tried helping but nothings worked! Is there any bun I can do that will preserve the waves better without leaving a weird dent? Any protective hairstyle? Any way I can style my bangs? Help!\n\nTLDR: How to make wavy hair last, how to wear wavy hair in a bun every day while keeping it healthy?\n\n- In the first photo, it is 90% dry and has no product.",

I’ve noticed recently that my pores have been bigger and more noticable. I’ve never really had visible pores, and I’m so scared I’ve done irreparable damage. What should I do? Should I back off the retinol or stop using it altogether?

I think this may be contributing, and I need to be moisturizing more; I’m just not sure if that will completely fix the problem.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

(I have no problem with that)..\n\nThe REASON I ask is because having a full wash routine has become very hard and too daunting to me 😔 I feel too severely depressed and too exhausted to do it all (condition, waiting, rinsing it out ect)...\n\nIs it okay to completely SKIP conditioner &amp; hair masks? I would like to SHAMPOO TWICE and be done with it!\n\nDoes anyone else do this? \n\nThank you!\n\n",

      "content": "have been on 1mg fin since january of 2023 and was on topical min from february of 2023 to august of 2024, saw amazing progress like all of my hair grew back. i then switched to oral min in august of 2024 (5mg) as it was getting annoying applying topical min to longer hair as well as concerns with a cat. I lost some of my gains but in retrospect i should’ve stayed on it and my hair looked great still. So in april of 2025 i switched back to topical min( grave mistake) as i thought the oral min was making me lose all my hair, i then went on to shed soooo much hair and realized you really can’t be on topical if you have pets as you will be stressing about it all the time. in mid july i switched back to oral min and my hair has not been growing back. at a loss of what to do and wish i never screwed with my stack. don’t know if i should hop on dut or go for a transplant, can’t tell if my hair is still minituarizing or if it’s just a minoxidil shed. \n\nit’s insane to me how i grew all of my hair back and hair loss was out of my head for so long and now it’s at the forefront again\n\nat a loss of what to do right now it’s been basically 5 months back on oral min and i don’t see any ré growth is happening or it’s hard to tell and i also feel like in the back of my head that the fin isn’t working, any of you guys have a story similar to this?",
