Diffuse upside down scrunch hair to the scalp for extra volume.\n\nI’m on the fence about serums and gels still. I feel like my hair isn’t as soft when I use them and the style has to be reset every day so what’s the point? I kind of like just letting my hair be really soft, and letting it do its thing until wash day. It may be a lil frizzy, but I think I like it that way unless there is a way to get a lot of volume with gel. I think I have 2c hair, or a mix of Irish curls.",

      "title": "[Miscellaneous] Advice/Help Requested for Angular Cheilitis",
      "content": "I have never posted on reddit before, but my frustration necessitates it. I'm asking for advice, help, or any other comments about (1) how to fix my skin issue, and/or (2) what talk about with my dermatologist. \\[Also, please avoid my patchy beard—it is gone as of an hour ago.\\]\n\n**Short Story:**\n\nAbout a month and a half ago I woke up with red, dry skin in the corners of my mouth. After a few dermatologist appointments and a few different treatments, my skin is still not fully healed. As of today, January 2, the redness has gone down, and the affected area has reduced, but my skin is still compromised.\n\nI was told I have angular cheilitis (perleche), but I'm not sure that's true. I've never had it before and I've tried the typical treatments for the inflammation—nystatin anti-fungal ointment and a topical steroid—but my skin is still inflamed, dry, and  cracked. I've used aquaphor healing ointment religiously, increased my vitamin intake (B complex, iron, L-lysine), changed to a softer, SLS-free toothpaste and mouthwash (Tom's of Maine), increased my water consumption (at least 100 fluid ounces a day, often more), and diligently kept the area clean of food and water. I use a gentle cetaphil cleanser and have actively avoided going outside in the cold, wind, and rain to prevent further irritation. I have also tried other balms/creams (more on those below), but alas, my skin is still red, dry, and cracked.\n\nAt this point, all I'm using is aquaphor (according to my dermatologist's recommendation, explained below). Some days my skin looks a little better, other days it looks worse than the day before. Ultimately, I feel like the aquaphor is not helping much (maybe it's just preventing the skin from worsening, but I'm not sure) and that the issue is an ongoing cycle.\n\nI'm at my wit's end!\n\n**Long Story:**\n\nAbout a week before Thanksgiving, I woke up with red, dry skin in the corners of my mouth. After a week of little change, I booked a dermatologist appointment where I was prescribed a Nystatin-triamcinolone combo ointment, which I was to apply 2 times a day for 2-3 weeks. I was also told to apply aquaphor (I will note that I wasn't told whether I could put this on top of the ointments, so I didn't at first). I diligently followed the application instructions, but after 2 weeks of application, my skin had barely improved (the red inflammation was slightly less vibrant). Understanding that prolonged topical steroid use could be harmful, I went back to my dermatologist. I figured if the medication did virtually nothing positive in 2 weeks, all it could do for 1 more week was cause damage.\n\nReturning to the dermatologist, I was giving Zoryve, which I was allowed to apply as much as I wanted, along with aquaphor. Typically, I would apply it twice a day, maybe three if I felt like I got something on my mouth which required cleaning. After 1 week of application, my skin remained the same.\n\nI decided to try another dermatologist, partly because I wasn't happy with the results, but mainly because the first dermatologist had a pattern of speaking to me for about 20 seconds. This new dermatologist was far more understanding and attentive. Ultimately, she instructed the following:\n\n* Apply triamcinolone steroid by itself in the morning.\n* Apply nystatin anti-fungal ointment by itself at night.\n* Put aquaphor on at all times, even on top of the ointment and steroid.\n* Change my toothpaste and mouthwash, which I did.\n\nI followed these instructions for 1 week, when suddenly my inflamed skin and fissures started to turn white (whiter than my normal skin tone, that is). I contacted her office, and she told me that she wasn't concerned about the whitening, but that I should stop the medicine and just use aquaphor.\n\nAccordingly, I've only been using aquaphor for the past two weeks. I hate the look of aquaphor because it makes my face feel and look greasy, but I'm willing to put up with this to fix the issue. The problem is that my skin hasn't significantly improved. Depending on the day, and depending even on the time of day, my skin looks improved or just as bad as it was a couple weeks ago.\n\nIn addition to the prescription ointments, I have done/am doing the following:\n\n* A week after the symptoms first arose, I started taking a B complex vitamin, along with iron, and L-lysine.\n* I increased my water intake significantly, even though I think I was properly hydrating before the symptoms first arose.\n* I clean my face with a gentle cetaphil cleanser and lukewarm water 2 times a day (I was doing this before the issue arose).\n* For about a week, I only slept on my back. I was told this issue could be caused by drooling, but I've never had an issue with drooling before, nor do I have a tendency to lick my lips.\n* I tried putting cerave moisturizing cream on my inflamed skin before putting the aquaphor on. My understanding is that aquaphor is an occlusive and just traps moisture. I figured my skin might just be dry (although I've seen some say dryness is good). Either way, it didn't help at all.\n* I used Bordeaux rash cream for babies for a couple of days. Although it succeeded in making me look ridiculous, it did not succeed in improving my condition.\n\nI also want to include that my diet looks the same as it did the months before my issues began.\n\nI have another appointment set up with the dermatologist, but that appointment is not for another week and a half, which is adding to my frustration.\n\nI'm concerned that this isn't angular cheilitis (maybe eczema?), that it might be caused by something other than a fungus or that the root cause is some oral problem, and that letting this issue continue for so long could result in scarring.\n\nI have already determined that I am basically going to demand some kind of swab test, and I already have a list of questions I want to ask.\n\n**That said, I wanted to come to Reddit to ask for any help or advice you might have—specifically on what questions to ask, what to try, and what steps to take. This has been really frustrating, and it’s something I’d like to resolve sooner rather than later.**",

My skin already looks worse (more red/bumps), and I’m not sure if that’s normal or what I should be doing right now. I know isotretinoin can have a lot of side effects, and I’m scared about things like hair thinning / health issues, and I really don’t know where to start with skincare or haircare.\n\nI already know that I should take a super good care of my hair.\n\nWhat basic skincare routine should I start with while on isotretinoin?\nAny product recommendations that worked for you on accutane/isotretinoin?\nShould I be doing hydration/moisturizer differently?\nHaircare tips, what helped you feel safe regarding hair loss?\n\n\nI’m pretty lost and scared, and I don’t really have support right now — any advice or shared experience would mean a lot ❤️\n",

      "content": "I’ve had really bad dandruff for over a year now. It’s not just light flakes it’s thick, stuck-to-the-scalp flakes, super itchy, and my scalp gets uncomfortable again just a day or two after washing. It looks a lot like **seborrheic dermatitis**  from what I’ve seen online.\n\nThe worst part is the hair fall. I’m losing SO much hair that it’s genuinely scaring me. Every wash, every comb  it feels like I’m slowly going bald. I know stress makes it worse, and I’m already under a lot of stress because my exams are right around the corner.\n\nBecause of that, I can’t visit a dermatologist right now. I don’t have the time or mental space, so I’m planning to order products online and just try to get this under control for now. I just want the itching and dandruff to stop, at least enough so the hair fall reduces.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\nAnti-dandruff shampoos with ketoconazole \nOr combination shampoos (ketoconazole + zinc pyrithione / ciclopirox / selenium sulfide, etc.)\n\nA leave-in lotion or serum that helps keep dandruff in check between washes\n\nAnything that helps control hair fall and help me regrow my hair\n\nWhat I don’t want:\n❌ Steroids (I don’t want rebound flares or dependency)\n❌ Minoxidil (not ready for the shedding or long-term commitment)\n\nExtra info:\nThe itching drives me crazy, especially at night\nDandruff comes back very fast after washing\n\nIf you’ve dealt with something similar and found anything that genuinely helped, please let me know  even if it’s a routine, shampoo rotation, or maintenance product. I’m honestly exhausted and just want some relief right now.\n\nP.S. I did take a little help from AI to organize my thoughts better the situation itself is very real though 😅\nI’ve attached a picture I found on Reddit because my dandruff looks almost exactly like this.\nThanks a lot 🤍",

I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and minor rosacea. I have no glow whatsoever!\n\nMy skin is so dry to the touch, even if I do my routine twice a day. It literally drinks up any moisture I put on my face. I try to drink a ton of water, but I notice no difference with water intake. I can’t wear any kind of foundation or concealer, it will flake off and look so obvious. I’m getting married in four months and I need an overhaul, but I’m scared of throwing a ton of new products on my face now since I am super breakout-prone. I’ll try new things, just nervous. Is there anything I’m not thinking of or something else I can be doing?\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nCeraVe SA Cleanser\n\nGood Molecules HA serum on damp skin\n\nInkey List Exosome Hydro-Glow Serum\n\nCureology Cream Moisturizer\n\nOnce dry, I apply Differin on top of my moisturizer, twice a week only. If I feel like I need some exfoliation, I use Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant powder cleanser, but never on Differin nights. \n\nMorning: Rinse with warm water, same serums except Differin, and use SPF\n\nI will take any and all advice welcome! I’m also open to aesthetic treatments so long as they aren’t too strong for my sensitive skin. Thank you skincare Redditors!!!",

Right now I have it at a chin length bob but what I really want is a pixie bob with highlights but nothing too crazy light since I don't want to damage my hair. The reason I want highlight is because my hair is extremely straight and my hairstylist said it is rather hard to show any texturization or layering because of it.\n\nEvery time I look up highlights, it's always on these gorgeous women with perfectly wavy, medium brown or blonde hair. And I have a hard time finding examples of straight and plain dark brown/black hair with highlights, especially for my ethnicity. \n\nWould anyone have any helpful suggestions about how to choose a proper color for highlights (is that a thing?) Is it even something that's possible with short hair? I also have yellowish skin tone which I'm a bit insecure about and I want to find a color that complements it. \n\nI would love suggestions, tips, comments, or even just \"you're not being realistic\".",

I've been on a course of accutane that worked for 3 months before the acne returned, although not as severe as it used to be.\n\nI have spent the past 2 years alternating between tretinoin &amp; now differin. Both have seen some success, yet the breakouts are still persistent and are affecting my self confidence. I'm wondering if they either aren't strong enough or I'm not seeing their full benefit due to a damaged skin barrier?\n\nMy face feels dry and tight even after the water hits it in the shower. Yet it also appears oily throughout the day. Around my nose and my cheeks are the worst. The simple act of massaging cleanser into my face turns my skin red. Acne breakouts are very common &amp; even worse the area around the breakouts turns bright red permanently? I'm now on the third day of stopping all actives &amp; sticking to a basic skincare routine.\n\n* **AM**\n* Rinse with water\n* Haruharu black rice toner\n* Purito unscented centella serum\n* Purito bamboo moisturiser\n* Beauty of Joseon aqua fresh SPF 50\n* **PM**\n* Haruharu black rice oil cleanser\n* Haruharu black rice cleanser\n* Haruharu black rice toner\n* Purito unscented centella serum\n* The ordinary squalane (few drops)\n* Purito bamboo moisturiser\n* Thick layer of CeraVe Healing Ointment\n\nAny suggestions on ways to repair my skin barrier if it is indeed damaged, or if I perhaps need to try and alternative to retinoids?

      "content": "I’m going on a ski trip in a couple of months with my partner and a few of our friends and I’m trying to think of ways to speed up my hair routine so that the others aren’t waiting around for me. My partner asked the other day why I tend to take longer than other people to get ready and it’s got me worrying about how to keep up a presentable look while not wasting other people’s time.\n\nI’m a curly girl who also straightens my hair sometimes using the Shark FlexFusion. Both of my routines for curly or straight take a little while (straightening takes a bit longer though, about 30/40 mins with the wet to dry straightening function) but generally if I have curly hair I need to wash and reset it each day as the hair is so fine that the curls don’t hold in a ‘presentable’ way overnight. With straight hair I can usually get away with it for a couple of days without washing but the issue is it takes time to style it and the FlexFusion is noisy so using it for a long time in an apartment around other people would 100% be annoying. The other girls going on the trip have hair that is easier to manage so their ‘get ready’ routine is less complicated.\n\nI want to look presentable as we will be doing aprés ski, and tbh just because I care about looking put together as I don’t feel confident or myself if I don’t. I can’t see my curls not getting messed up with the headgear so I’ve thought about getting a temporary straightening treatment but I’m worried about it ruining the curls.. would really appreciate any other thoughts or advice",

But recently I've been experiencing acne and white pus filled spots on my face and the hard bumps on my top cheek bone as well. \n\nBut the problem is these aren't on my entire face.\n\nWhite pus filled spots on my nose creases and top of forehead\n\nAcne on top of my left eyebrow only (I've broken out at the same spot about 4 times now send help pls)\n\nAnd lastly the hard bumps on my left cheek under my eyes. \n\nThe bumps usually go away once they're big enough and with oil cleansing and a deep massage but I've never had them before a few months ago and they keep reappearing.\n\nThe main stressful part is that I can't pinpoint why or what exactly is causing this since its all concentrated at certain spots. My right cheek, chin, nose and rest of the forehead are clear and normal as usual.\n\nFor reference my skincare is-\n\nMinimalist salicylic acid face wash 2x morning and night\nMinimalist oil free B5 moisturizer 2x morning and night\nFoxtale glow 50+ SPF sunscreen\n\nCosrx AHA BHA toner 2x-3x a week (these days I've been applying it to my acne parts daily)\n\nA few things that might have caused these are that I shifted to Delhi which has horrible air and my food quality has degraded. But it still doesn't explain why its only at certain spots :(\n\nSomeone told me to try a gentler cleanser for regular use and switch my moisturizer but I've been using this same routine for around 2+ years with no issue so i want to get some more opinions before actually switching my skincare.\n\nI would love some advice on why this is happening and how I could fix it. Product recommendations are also appreciated!! Thank you guys ♡",

The rest of my face holds up fine. I have combination skin  slightly oily around the nose, normal elsewhere. I prep with moisturizer and sunscreen, let everything sit, then apply foundation with a sponge.\n\nI’m not looking for brand recommendations only  I’m more interested in *technique*. Things like application order, waiting times between layers, whether powder placement matters, or if I should be skipping certain steps in those areas.\n\nIf you’ve dealt with this and fixed it, I’d really appreciate knowing what actually helped.",

I also have some white heads.\n\nI also considered my body, I have some dry patches under my breast and overall dryness on my limbs. I also have darkness on my armpits probably due to shaving and also have clogged pores in there. I have acne in my back, chest and even breasts, between my breasts it is dry, under my breasts I have clogged pores. On my legs i have these things that look like bug bites and left me some scars?? i think it might have been acne, i also have acne on my thigh close to my bikini area.\n\nI want someone to help me change some of the products and hopefully also make it cheaper but at the same time that i could use to target all of these problems that i have on my body overall! I would be super grateful. Is okay to make fun of me as long as you can help me afterwards 😭\n\nI am overweight and sedentary which i am changing this year.
