      "content": "Hi! I've been wanting short hair for a longgg time &amp; finally got the courage to get my first ever haircut last year. It used to be waist-length when stretched. I got it cut to around shoulder-length (with shrinkage: a little bit past my chin). \n\n**Important context though** On Day 1 of wash day I have less volume and more definition (as seen in pics 1 &amp; 2) but around Day 3-4 I have a LOT of volume (as seen in pics 3 &amp; 5). I also learned it can turn into an afro the first month after my haircut because it was short enough and cut into a round shape (pic 7)\n\nI'm getting another haircut soon and would love to get a pixie this time (reference pics 8-12), but I'd like to get some advice from my fellow redditers. I know all about the pros and cons but I'm just a bit nervous, **with my features will I look more or less feminine? Do I have the features to pull it off? I won't lie, these things are important to me.** Lmk what you think I included pics with and w/o makeup &lt;3\n\nWash-n-go routine:\nWash with Native Coconut shampoo\nConditioner: Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Conditioner, detangle in 6 sections with Crave Naturals brush\nRinse thoroughly\nAdd Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Leave-in Cream to each section, prayer hand method\nBrush style with Crave Naturals brush for volume\nRake in Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic Gel to each section, finger coiling any curls that need some extra love\nAir dry, then scrunch out the crunch with Carol's Daughter 7 Oil Blend Hair &amp; Scalp Oil\nI use a bonnet every night, no refresh\n",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nSo normally I don’t post much, but wanted to drop this as a warning for anyone buying products purely on hype and regretting later.\n\nBack in September I got into fitness, and by December started protein supplements. My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily.\n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

      "content": "Hi all! \n\nI'm a 29F and a goal to take better care of myself this year, I'm looking into a skincare routine that will be both realistic and effective. \n\nHowever, I don't really know where to start and am completely overwhelmed by the amount of different products and ingredients that exist.   Hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, ceramides, salicylic acid, green tea, rice water, antioxidants, vitamin A, vitamin C, etc... What makes a good product vs a low-quality one? \n\nI'm neurodivergent and need a routine that is quick and easy otherwise I won't do it. I also don't like the feeling of having products (lotions, etc..) on my skin. I can handle a product if it gets absorbed quickly but I'm worried about the weight of too many products. \n\nIf anyone has any routine suggestions, product recommendations, advice or useful information that could guide me in the right direction, I would be extremely grateful! \n\nThank you!\n\n\nAdditional info: \n\nI have a combination (T zone) and somewhat sensitive skin. I rarely wear any makeup. I also work from home and don't go out much (though I am also working on that) so I get very little sun exposure. \n\nMy main concerns are:\n- enlarged pores (visible sebaceous filaments): used to be only on my nose, now spreading to my cheeks and forehead.\n- redness (mostly on my nose, perhaps rosacea?): appeared after a bad sunburn while travelling and the redness has never left. \n\nSecondary concerns:\n- aging skin: I notice more (forehead) lines and less plumpness.\n- pimples: was not a problem until 1-2 years ago (when I started menstruating again after some years of amenorrhea).\n\nMy current routine has stayed the same since my very eco-friendly/granola years (8-10 years ago) and is baking soda to cleanse and exfoliate my face (daily) and a calendula balm for hydration (when I remember). I used my mother's Nuxe Super Serum as a teenager when an unhealthy lifestyle made my skin age prematurely and it did wonders but it's out of my budget right now and I have a feeling skincare science has evolved in the last 15 years so better options might exist.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Is it normal to have another shed every time I up my finasteride dosage? \n\n(I’m 22, 5 months and 2 weeks in, and about a Norwood 2.5/3)\n\nFor context, when I started taking finasteride, I was on 0.25 mg 3 times a week. About 2-3 months in I started to shed, my hairline was getting worse and everything was thinning. But supposedly that was normal, so I wasn’t too worried. \n\nIt was during that time I decided to up the dosage to 0.50 mg 3 times a week—eventually build my way up to 1 mg if I handled 0.5 well. After a couple weeks my hair seemed to be getting better. Not better before the shed, but improving. The shedding had subsided.\n\nBut some time after, I started shedding again. And I suppose on instinct I decided to up the dosage to 1 mg 3 times a week. I was already planning to, but I can’t lie, it was more so driven out of fear because of the shed. I thought that big shed was already behind me so it kinda screwed with me seeing another. \n\nBut for about a month after, things seemed to be getting better. Again, not better before the shed, but improving. Shedding subsided. But, as of last week I started to shed again and my hair is looking worse. \n\nI’m thinking about upping the frequency to every other day, but I can’t help but notice that I seem to be shedding some time after upping dosage, and I wanna know if there‘s something to that. Maybe it would be for the best to just stick it out with 1 mg 3 times a week for a little while longer.\n\nBut part of me is nervous that the fin isn’t working, which leads me to my next question.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nIs it normal for my hair to be better in some places and worse in others?\n\nLike I mentioned above, the shed eventually subsides, and after a while I see recovery, but only in some places.\n\nFor example, there used to be thinning on my right temple that was clearly making its way toward the middle of my hairline/crown, but as of today, it’s seemingly filled in. I don’t see the thinning anymore. But at the exact same time my right temple has kinda gotten better, my left temple continues to recede and is getting worse. And I don’t know if that’s normal. It’s even gotten better \\*and\\* worse in the same spot.\n\nPart of me thinks it only filled in because the hair eventually grew back, just more miniaturized, and not because the finasteride was working.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nWith all that said, this is why I’m kinda hemming and hawing between sticking with 1 mg 3 times a week a little while longer, or if I should go to every other day. Because from my perspective, it feels like a 50/50 shot between what I’m going through being a perfectly normal part of the finasteride process, or it just not working at all. Like yeah, my hair might be filling in because of the finasteride, but it could also be because the miniaturized hairs grew back, y’know?\n\nAnd before anyone starts to recommend taking the normal daily dosage or adding minoxidil or anything of the like—I don’t wanna do that \\*yet\\*. I don’t want to start a nuclear stack I have to commit to for the rest of my life if I don’t have to. \n\nThe way I want to go about my hair loss is finding the least amount to get me where I need to be, and do more as needed. Because at the end of the day, I just wanna stop thinking about the hair loss and go about my life without my Norwood protection plan being front and center. But I \\*will\\* if \\*need\\* be.\n\n  \nTLDR; Is it normal to see another shed after adjusting finasteride dose and is it normal for hair to be getting better in some places and getting worse in others?",

I have some gray hairs, but not many.\n\nHey guys, happy new year! So I shaved my head over the summer due to a scalp condition. I am growing out something similar to a mohawk but need to keep the sides shaved or buzzed due to my skin condition. Also I like the look. I am going to be coloring my hair with a dark burgundy demi-permanent dye. It's my first time using demi-permanent, is it substantially less damaging than permanent? Also, I am considering growing out the \"mohawk\" area but not sure how to with my hair texture. You usually see this style with straight hair, and I'm not sure how it would look. I have been DIYing my hair since I was 14, I cannot afford salons. I do have a small amount of cosmetology training. I don't want to iron my hair, but I have stretched it with products and liked the results so I am open to that. Any ideas for upcoming colors and styles? Length, etc? I do not want to lighten my hair either, due to the damage it does.\n\nRoutine: CeraVe shampoo, CeraVe conditioner, Honest Leave-In spray, Prose custom curl cream (run through hair with fingers), Prose custom hair gel (run through hair with fingers), air-dry. I do not protect my hair when sleeping, I refresh with water when needed.",
