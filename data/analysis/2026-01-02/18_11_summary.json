I like the kinda wild hair I’ve been rocking lately.\n\nRoutine \\* loves curl shampoo and conditioner. Use the curl butter around a quarter size amount after wash, leave in for 5ti 10 minutes and rinse out. \n\nAround 15 pumps of the Davines leave in. \n\nSometimes I’ll use the Davines curl serum but I’m on the fence, as I don’t like the crunch and just like my hair silky soft so sometimes I’ll nix it. Diffuse upside down scrunch hair to the scalp for extra volume.\n\nI’m on the fence about serums and gels still. I feel like my hair isn’t as soft when I use them and the style has to be reset every day so what’s the point? I kind of like just letting my hair be really soft, and letting it do its thing until wash day. It may be a lil frizzy, but I think I like it that way unless there is a way to get a lot of volume with gel. I think I have 2c hair, or a mix of Irish curls.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I struggled with acne when young, but thankfully it went away on its own with a bit of time. But now I’ve got some rashes/irritation on my cheeks, and some acne marks I guess?\n\nI have never used any type of products nor applied any oils or whatsoever, so I’m completely in the dark on what I should be using or buying.\n\nMy skin is mixed: my forehead and nose are oily but the rest of my face is dry. Sometimes after shower I get tiny bits of flaky skin around my eyebrows.\n\nI also have some dark spots/sebaceous filaments on my nose.\n\nAny recommendations on what I should be using to make my skin silky smooth and healthy?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "content": "Hi! Seeking help for a moisturizer rec. My primary skin complaint is deep, large cysts around my jawline/cheeks. I have seen derms in the past and they generally chalk it up to PCOS. Spiro helps, but isn't something you can take while trying to become pregnant or nursing and so I haven't been on it in a while. I've also been diagnosed with Hydradenitis (but it's pretty mild).\n\nI recently (about a month ago) switched to LRP Toleriane Double Repair as my PM moisturizer and feel like it might have contributed to a worse than usual breakout I'm currently trying to fix.\n\nAM: \n* Skinceuticals Glycolic Renewal Cleanser\n\n* Paula's Choice Vitamin C + Glutathione (2-3x a week)\n\n* Elta MD UV Clear \n\n\nPM: \n* Skinceuticals cleanser\n\n* Differin OTC (every other night)\n\n* night moisturizer- LRP now, but over the years have also tried first aid beauty, TO's moisturizer, Vanicream, Biossance squalane oil, Elta MD night cream, and once on the rec of a friend with psoriasis thinking maybe my skin was just horrifically dry, Kiehls Midnight Recovery cream (waaaay too rich). \n\nI give every new product a couple of months but feel like I always get worse breakouts than if I don't use moisturizer (eek) or just use the sunscreen as a moisturizer. When I do that, stuff calms down (but my face feels dry, so I don't think this is ideal.) I think a lot of this is due to the niacinimide and zinc in the sunscreen.\n\nCan anyone recommend a moisturizer that vibes well with deep cysts, and also has zinc and/or niacinimide in it?",

The problem I run into is I am just barely thinning, so it feels like I just end up getting a lot on my hair as well.\n\nInstead I've been applying drops at the front of my hairline, tilting my head back, and letting them go back while I rub it in...still get wet hair.\n\nAre there any other techniques or tools you can use to get less on the hair? Or is it okay for your hair to get some of the liquid as well? Looking for any advice here.\n\nThanks!",

      "content": "I'm planning to get a hair transplant and because of it  I've been taking 1mg of finasteride a day for over 7 months now . Before starting my treatment with this drug, I performed a blood test out of curiosity to check my individual hormonal parameters and then see how they would change during the treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tests I performed before starting treatment and their results:\n\n\n\nDHT Result: 389,42 Norms: 143-842\n\n\n\nTSH Result: 1,205  Norms : 0.35-4.94\n\n\n\nFT4 Result: 1,04   Norms:  0.7-1,48\n\n\n\nEstradiol Result: 43.0 Norms: 11-44\n\n\n\nProlactin Result 8.90 Norms: 3,46-19,4\n\n\n\nTestosteron: Result: 26,94 Norms: 8,33-30,19\n\n\n\n\n\nToday I went to the lab to do the blood tests needed for the hair transplant and I thought it would be interesting to do some hormone tests to see how the levels of various parameters are after 7 months on finasteride:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's test results:\n\n\n\nDHT-still waiting\n\n\n\nEstradiol: Result 26.00 Norms : 11-44\n\nTestosteron 29,15 Norms 8.33-30,19\n\nPSA: 0.404 Norms: 0-4\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now my question... as you can see, the most important parameter, dhd, has not yet arrived but it surprises me that despite 7 months of taking finasteride, my level of estradiol has DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY!!!!. I am very surprised because from what I know, this drug blocks the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone, which results in a decrease in the level of dht, as well as an increase in the level of testosterone and estradiol.\n\nAs for the testosterone level, it is indeed elevated, but only slightly. Is there a chance that despite such a long therapy, finasteride won't work for me at all? I tried to find some information on the internet, but it seems like nobody had a case like mine.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would appreciate any help\n\n",

While I am aware it’s probably genetic I’m willing to try anything that may help.\n\nOther causes may be sleep, I’m a stomach sleeper and do have trouble sleeping although do get an avg of at least 7-8 hours\n\nI also get pretty bad hayfever and my room is very dusty. I take Vitamin D and have a healthy diet and exercise daily. Any help is appreciated ( I also currently use a coffee eye serum that does mask it slightly but turns white and noticeable after some time) (( I’m also male so makeup probably isn’t my answer))",
