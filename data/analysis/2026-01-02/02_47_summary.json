      "content": "Hi all,\n\nSo normally I don’t post much, but wanted to drop this as a warning for anyone buying products purely on hype and regretting later.\n\nBack in September I got into fitness, and by December started protein supplements. My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily.\n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I have oily, sensitive acne-prone skin. I currently use Aveeno Clear Complexion foaming cleanser and CeraVe Daily moisturizer (yes I know, this isn’t really enough). I recently started using The Ordinary salicylic acid 2% serum and have noticed some good results since adding it to my routine. I want to switch cleansers, add a toner, continue using the salicylic acid serum, and switch moisturizers to focus more on my acne. I’m thinking of starting CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream cleanser with 4% benzoyl peroxide, The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% toned, CeraVe Retinol Face serum, continuing The Ordinary salicylic acid 2% serum, and need recommendations for acne-safe moisturizers. Any and all advice is appreciated! Are these new products I’m looking into adding to my routine recommended from skincare addicts? Tips on moisturizers? Thank you!",

In a week I noticed the redness on my forehead decrease, I decided focus on my body (as a distraction) and started kcal deficit to lose weight, after my diet no new pimple appeared in my cheeks.motivated me to go back into skin care, I started buying different alternatives for the previous skin care, I bought kojic soap instead of hydroquinone, glycolic instead of azelaic, nizoral instead of Sulphur (for my fungal), then I bought the first moisturiser that I saw in the shop (I didn't even look it up) it's all in the picture\n\nIn two months I got my skin to clear from everything with this routine\n\nAm: nizoral 10 minutes, then pea sized soft Nivea moisturizer, no sunscreen\n\nPm: koji san soap 5 minutes daily, 1 time a week glycolic acid (cream called demelan), 1 time a week tretnion 0.05, soft Nivea moisturizer daily\n\nI think my mistake in the beginning was not addressing the main issue of fungal acne (the reason of the itchy and reddness and thinking that sulpher soap was enough, using too many moist creams (thick moisturizer/sunscreen) combine that with the sweat, so uncomfortable that make double cleanse necessity. The 2f moisturizer that I picked randomly is better than avene that had all the hype on the internet, I also think the deit change also helped me so much ",

The issue is most of the styles I like on other people are usually for a different hair type than mine and I would need a lot of work styling my hair to look like it if I where to get a cut like that.\n\nI have quite thick straight hair that I have to use straighteners for to get the shape I usually have. I was wondering if there were any hair styles that I could be recommended that would suit me, be feminising and “alt” and that don’t take that much time or effort to style?\n\n(Or if there is one that would suit me and would be doable to style, leaving instructions on how would also be useful)\n\n((Last time I got it cut the salon lady had it sorta straight with some bangs and it looked really good but I have like 0 idea how to replicate what she did, I’ll include what that looked like on the last image)",

I had very clear skin until I tried an oil cleanser at the same time and started breaking out. I think it might’ve been the perfect storm to disrupt my skin. I then moved from ny to fl and my breakouts have been worse and happening for a year now. I have oily/combo skin and I am not sure how to fix this. I am not sure if it is the humidity, if it’s my products or I don’t know. I have tried adapelene and Paula’s choice Bha and it has made my skin very sensitive. I have also been eating very very clean. I am currently only using La Roche posay toleraine cleanser for oily skin and La Roche posay matte moisturizer as well as the anua azelaic acid. Most of my acne is little bumps or deep pimples that slowly or don’t rise. Any tips to fix this? ",

I've been using the neutrogena \"deep clean brightening cleanser\", neutrogena \"ultra gentle daily moisturiser\", and neutrogena \"hydro boost face lotion sunscreen\". They've really helped with my skin, cleared it up and kept it hydrated.\n\nThe cleanser has niacinamide, the moisturiser has 5% glycerin, vitamin b5 and niacinamide, nd the sunscreen has hyaluronic acid. \n\nI'm running low and need to restock soon but it turns out Neutrogena has a couple of ethical concerns through Johnson and Johnson, including animal testing and also links to ongoing conflicts that I really don't want to support.\n\nDoes anybody have any good dupes for these products that have a higher ethical rating? Thanks so much for any recommendations or tips  🙏.",

I don’t want it too short or blunt — more soft, airy, and natural.\n\nFor context, I think my hair is thick with a slight wave (around 2A–2B), but let me know if that sounds wrong.\n\nHow much would a barber usually take off from the front to achieve this?\nDoes hair type or thickness change how much needs cutting?\n\nPics attached. Any advice appreciated.\n",
