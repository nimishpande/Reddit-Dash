The issue is most of the styles I like on other people are usually for a different hair type than mine and I would need a lot of work styling my hair to look like it if I where to get a cut like that.\n\nI have quite thick straight hair that I have to use straighteners for to get the shape I usually have. I was wondering if there were any hair styles that I could be recommended that would suit me, be feminising and “alt” and that don’t take that much time or effort to style?\n\n(Or if there is one that would suit me and would be doable to style, leaving instructions on how would also be useful)\n\n((Last time I got it cut the salon lady had it sorta straight with some bangs and it looked really good but I have like 0 idea how to replicate what she did, I’ll include what that looked like on the last image)",

It’s a way to give my hair a bleach break, let it grow, and get it healthier.\n\nFor the past seven-ish years, I’ve had everything from super short hair to shoulder-length, mostly in pink. Sometimes blonde, sometimes pink with hints of blue or purple—but I always came back to pink.\n\nI’ve often debated growing my hair out, but I usually kept it short because I liked it, and I stuck with pink because I was drawn to it and thought it looked good on me.\n\nStill, part of me wondered about trying brown—or just keeping it blonde. But brown? I’d think, no way, that looks bad on me. At least blonde is safe if I’m not going pink. (It's odd pink is my safe space and in reality brown should be haha) \n\nSo I added a dark brown blend at my roots to make the grow-out and blonde ends look less harsh.\n\nNow I find myself questioning the brown… while also missing pink 😔. Will I always wonder until I try it? I think I might like it—but I’m also worried I won’t, and then I’d have to bleach it out, which I’m trying to avoid while getting my hair healthier.\n\nSo here I am, debating: go for the dark espresso brown like pic 3, or stick with my safe pink that I’ve always loved? What do you think?\n\nAnyway thank you for any help (: ",

My main products as of right now are the Ouai conditioner for medium hair, the pureology leave-in spray, and the Moroccanoil treatment oil. I don’t really have a set routine to be honest, so sometimes I’ll use just the leave-in, sometimes I’ll use just the oil, and sometimes I’ll use both. I figured those 3, or at least the conditioners wouldn’t be too heavy on my hair, but they usually leave it feeling gross. Any recommendations? Thank you",

I have quite dry skin. For my facial moisturizer, I think it’s doing ok because I never feel that icky layer of moisturizer on my face and it does the job pretty well (still open to better moisturizers on the market). Although, HERE IS THE PROBLEM; I’m not sure what type of sensitivity this is, but I can’t STAND feeling moisturizer on my body. Especially if I want to put on skin tight jeans or any piece of fabric that clings to my body. It just feels sticky and leaves almost this layer of humidity between my skin and the clothes (even if I let the moisturizer dry before putting clothes on). Now, until I shower and wash my body, this thick layer is on my skin which makes it so hard for me to get dressed and not want to rip my skin off. I barely ever put body moisturizer for this reason. This is why I’m looking for recommendations for a good lightweight body moisturizer, for dry skin, that won’t leave this weird layer of humidity on my skin. Please, any recommendations !!!",
