I tried doing that ‚Äúwater test‚Äù to figure out my hair type but omg it‚Äôs so confusing, I still don‚Äôt know what category I fall into ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.. so I thought of trying few things like a sample or mini of sorts \nSo ran to smytten, where I saw selected these as there were no masks for trying üò≠. \nI‚Äôm also kinda lazy with routines, so I need something that‚Äôll help without me doing 10 steps every day. Do you think a mask works better for this, or should I just stick to conditioner? Based on my hair pic + the options here, which one do you think will actually help? Also open to any holy-grail recs you swear by! ‚ú®ü§åüèª",
