      "content": " My eczema just decided to make a comeback on my inner elbow AND neck, The itching, the redness, the irritation it’s like no matter how much I try to take care of my skin, it always finds a way to creep back.And of course it has to show up in the most uncomfortable places where it bends and rubs all the time. Does anyone else deal with this recurring nonsense? How do you even cope when it feels like your own skin is out to get you. It’s itchy, annoying, and honestly making me stressed I can't go without scratching. I can't study I can't focus on anything else I just want normal skin for once. They  are red. I'm turning red -pink ppl will assume these  rashes to be hickeys.I hate this pls help how to cope with this what to use to prevent this. ",
