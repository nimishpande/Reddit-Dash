      "content": "​Hey everyone! I'm celebrating a huge milestone today: three years of consistent hair growth, and I've genuinely never been happier with my hair journey. It's been a marathon, not a sprint, and I won't lie—it's been a lot of work. But seeing the progress and feeling this level of confidence is so incredibly worth every single effort.\n​My routine is pretty simple, which is probably why I've been able to stick with it. I only wash my hair once a week, which has been a game-changer for maintaining moisture and preventing breakage. This has been essential for me. When I do wash it, my go-to style is a wash-and-go. I absolutely love how it defines my curls and cuts down on styling time during the week.\n​So, what's my secret sauce? I swear by Brazilian hair products, and I'm a huge fan of Novex in particular. Their deep conditioners and masks have transformed my hair from the inside out, making it stronger and more resilient. The difference is night and day. I also incorporate a coconut oil treatment once a week for that extra boost of hydration and shine. It's a simple, affordable step that makes a huge impact. To top it all off, I define my curls with Eco Style gel. It gives me the perfect hold without the crunch, which is exactly what I need to keep my wash-and-go looking fresh and frizz-free all week long.\n​I'm so glad I stuck with it. If you're on a similar journey, just know that consistency is key. Find what works for you and don't be afraid to experiment. If anyone has questions about my routine or product recommendations, feel free to ask! I'm happy to share more.",

      "content": "For ref I am 31, skin is somewhat sensitive, dehydrated (not dry) that leans a little oily. (Haven’t figured out how to cross post into the 30+ skincare sub)\n\nI want my skin in a better place, for the longest time it’s been uneven and there’s always a new patch of bumps or minor black/whiteheads somewhere after other ones heal. My skin doesn’t really like hyaluronic acid (I have tried every way to apply it) but likes polyglutamic acid, and can only take low concentrations of niacinamide.\n\nI’ve been using Paula’s Choice lactic and salicylic acid toners every few days because everyday was too much for me. It made me oily and I repaired my barrier with Skin1004 Probio Centella serum. I use Skin1004 Centella cleansing oil and Inkylist SA cleanser which I found controlled sebaceous filaments better than without the oil (even though I don’t wear makeup often anymore).\n\nI’m trying to introduce retinol and azelaic acid into my routine for overall clearer, smoother (trying to get rid of forehead lines), and more even skin tone while trying to hit some old acne marks. I’m fatigued from targeting new problems and want a routine that will maintain my skin. I have used the CeraVe resurfacing retinol serum twice this week and Naturium 10% topical azelaic acid in combo with the retinol once, toning with I’m Black Rice niacinamide toner because I’ve read niacinamide plays well with ret and AA. I’m apprehensive for any purging or irritation from starting new actives.\n\nThe plan is to use ret/AA and BHA/AHA both twice a week alternating the days, never using on the same day and never using one at night then the other immediately the next morning. It’ll go something like ret/AA one night, no exfoliating actives the next whole day, bha/aha the next night, break day again, then repeat. Only mid-week do I have two days where I use these actives on two consecutive nights with no break day in between. Every day I will be using the Probio serum, polyglutamic acid and Illiyoon Ato cream, with kikumasamune sake lotion(toner) here and there as a base or a toning mask, hoping the ceramides in serum and cream will keep my barrier safe.\n\nIs this too many actives in a week?",

      "content": "Hi everyone. This'll be a bit of a long/vent-y post so please bare with me. I'm posting here because I don't know anyone with hair like me/other curly girls so I figured a Reddit community could help me out and relate to my struggles. \n\nMy hair has gone through so many phases. Super long, pixie cut, mid length, layers, no layers, you name it. \n\nPictures 1 &amp; 2 are my current hair, photos taken today. \n3 is May of this year \n4 is January 2023\n5 is my virgin natural hair from 4 years ago\n\nAs you can see, my hair has been dyed. And it's been dyed several times. It had pink highlights that were bleached and has since faded. In the 4th pic my hair had blonde highlights as well but was cut short. \n\nThe issue I have is that my hair is never the same. I feel like my curl pattern has changed a lot especially since growing it out and having bleached highlights. I miss the poofy, fluffy, \"80's style\" curls I had. \n\nI can't tell my hair is damaged, too long and weighed down, or I'm just getting older and my hair isn't like it was when I was 18 in that 4th picture. I'm 21 now. Even my natural hair had many ringlets I don't see often anymore.\n\nA part of me believes I have low density curls and I need to compensate for that by having short hair, but I want the mid length fluffy voluminous curls I see all over Pinterest. I'm probably in denial and can't have that. I want to grow my hair out but volume will always be more important to me.\n\nI watched a YouTube video talking about why a curly girl opted for no layers for her fine curls, and her hair looked voluminous and thick. She said layers made her hair look stringy, especially at the bottom layer when her hair started growing out. I feel like that's what's happening with my hair too.\n\nAs for my routine, here is what I do currently.\n-Mielle rosemary and mint shampoo every other day, on rare occasion every 2 days.\n-Carol's daughter conditioner every other day\n-Garnier leave in air dry conditioner \n-Herbal essence curl boosting mousse \n-Sleep sometimes in a pineapple bun w/ bonnet, sometimes in a ponytail\n\nI try to limit how much product I use. I don't even know what I should be using for my hair type. All I know is that my hair likes light weighted products and diffusing, which I don't do. And I know I should..I'm just lazy. Everytime I tried to diffuse my hair looks frizzy and a mess.\n\nI suppose I'm looking for advice on what haircut may fit me and my curl pattern, layers or no layers? maybe some color ideas too. Any product or routine advice is more than welcome. Sometimes I feel insecure because I wish I could go back in time and have my dream hair— but I can't undo all the box dye and highlights. \n\nIf anyone took the time to read, THANK YOU so much. I have no one to turn to for advice. I live in a small town where curly hair like mine is rare and there aren't curl specialists anywhere near me. I appreciate you hearing me out.\n\nTLDR; Insecure about changing curl pattern and would appreciate any advice such as haircuts, curl routines for low density curls, or hair color ideas. Personal stories are welcome too. \n\nThanks!",

So then I stopped exfoliating daily. I switched to every 3 days. But now, when I look back at pictures from that time, I can barely see any pimples- just a few.\n\n- I ended up getting pimples from makeup (it was my first time using it) and I continued with exfoliating every three days and moisturising + additionally cleansing it everyday\n\n- Then I felt like maybe the sunscreen was clogging my pores too so I started double cleansing every morning.\n\n- Breakout continues and is gradually getting worse\n\n- I heard the brand I use to exfoliate is bad so I stop using it completely. Then I realise that my cleanser is more than likely expired.\n\n- I get a new version of that cleanser (it's always made my skin feel so soft), I get smth with salicylic acid in it (supposed to be used daily) and continue with the same moisturiser. I started that over a week ago, and started using pimple patches the same time too.\n\n- Switched from double cleansing + salicylic in the morning to doing it in the night, cleansing once in the morning\n\nIt's been a week or so and I just see things gradually getting worse. \nPics 2&amp;3: 12/9\nPics 4, 5, 6, 7, 8&amp;9: 17/9\nPics 10 and on: today\n\nWhat do I do?????

      "content": "My tween initially had a few spots on her forehead. We tried benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid spot treatments at different times, but her skin seemed to flare up, and over time she developed more congestion with some inflamed bumps across her forehead.\n\nWe then tried a gentler approach using a benzoyl peroxide cleanser, which helped a little. However, even with short-contact use, her skin still became red and irritated.\n\nEventually, we saw a dermatologist who prescribed Epiduo to be used every four days. Although I mentioned that her skin seems sensitive and reactive, I decided to have her use only adapalene, applied as a short-contact treatment after cleansing and washed off after a few minutes every five days. She did go through a purge, but her skin did improve.\n\nAfter a few months, however, her skin suddenly began reacting badly to adapalene. We took a 10-day break, during which her skin calmed, though it started getting slightly congested again. Because she has more closed comedones than inflamed pimples, we thought a salicylic acid cleanser might be more suitable for her sensitive skin. We now use it once a week. Some closed comedones have resolved, but she still experiences flare-ups, and her skin takes about a week to settle before the next wash. On other days, she uses a gentle cleanser and moisturizer.\n\nI’m wondering whether her skin issues may have been caused, at least in part, by the use of active treatments, since she previously did not have a consistent cleansing or moisturizing routine. I’m considering taking a step back from actives to focus on healing her skin barrier. I worry she may get congested again, but ongoing irritation is also concerning.\n\nDoes anyone have thoughts or advice? I would really appreciate it. ",

I've had acne and eczema at the same time on my face but that was many years ago, and my face dries out easily if I don't use anything, but it also gets super oily super fast. I could be wrong, but that's why I think I have combination skin. My skin is very sensitive as well so I can't use anything super harsh. I currently use the Nivea lotion(friend suggestion) as my moisturizer after I cleanse and use a toner (and I use an exfoliant once a weekish). For a little portion of time I used a sampler of La Roche-Posay's matte moisturizer and everything cleared up. I was never shiny and my acne went away. It was so wonderful. My only hesitation is that it's a little pricy for how much you get, so is there anything that would almost do the same thing at a lower price tag (or same price just more product)? I'm also open to suggestions for a daily sunscreen since I've heard that could be beneficial? Thanks!",

      "content": "So I have horribly oily skin and because of that I’ve always avoided sunscreen unless I was going to be out in the sun a lot on a certain day (bad, I know).\n\nRecently (in the last six months), I’ve been on medication that makes me extra sensitive to the sun, so I’ve been being good and wearing it daily. I’ve been using Eucerin Antishine Mattifying SPF 50, and it’s tolerable (I still hate it, it still makes me significantly oilier, but it’s not as bad as other formulas, so I’m dealing with it). I’ve figured out how to make it work with my makeup routine and I have noticed my old acne marks are fading faster since using it, so it’s going ok.\n\nHowever, the one thing I cannot figure out is how to not get it in my mouth. It’s not a lot that gets in there, but it’s enough that I can taste the gross bitter/plasticky taste of it, and it happens almost every day. I don’t understand, I don’t put it on my lips and it’s not like I’m licking the perimeter of my mouth on a regular basis so I have no idea how it happens.\n\nAnyone else have this issue? Did anything work for you to solve it?",

I use whatever shampoo and conditioner dollar store has, and i was gifted a curl hair mask some time ago, so i use that too. i also have been using a styling gel from dollar store, and sea salt spray from walmart (if anyone asks no ive never had a issue with hair products from dollar store). i did recently buy a styling gel for curly hair from the same brand of the sea salt spray, but i wont be using that until i use up the rest of the styling gel i still have. my hair naturally has a lot of volume, but i feel the curls could be more defined. and as for the styling, i have no idea how to go about doing that. so if anyones got any tips or tricks or hair product suggestions ill take it. and if you got any questions about my hair i will do my best to answer them. thanks girls! :)",

All I want is a healthy discussion and some perspective.\n\nI see a lot of you in this sub using products certain products that contain added fragrance (as in, it's mentioned on the ingredients list). For those of you with sensitive skin, does it not cause any irritation? \n\nI don't really have a severe acne problem (thankfully), it's just mild breakouts now and then. I do have PIH though, from healed breakouts. I have a sensitive skin in general, it's always been like that, not just because of a compromised skin barrier. I have mild oiliness on my face- a combination skin type.\n\nI see lots of cleansing products targeted towards skin that have oiliness but theoretically, those look too harsh to be applied on a face like mine, since it's also sensitive. Plus, most sensitive skin cleansers contain fatty alcohols, which my skin absolutely does not tolerate, my face starts forming bumps which are painful. \n\nWhen it comes to moisturizers, I have tried thick creams (cerave), gone without applying creams in hot weather (used a thick essence instead, rovectin), and currently apply a lotion since it's lightweight (1025 dokdo lotion), yet it causes my face to sweat when I step out in the heat. What do you people use? \n\nComing to sunscreens, I've mostly had a negative relation with it. None of them felt good to wear, so I'm not quite regular with it. Currently I use the Re'equil matte sunscreen (blue one), it's not as bad, but still makes my face a bit greasy as the day goes on. But, I suppose I have to work with it, it's the best one I've stumbled upon so far. It does have added fragrance though (IFRA), is that alright for sensitive skin? Or should I look for alternatives?

      "content": "Helloo so I’ve always had problems finding the right products for my face. I have combination skin (my T-zone and forehead are oily, but my cheeks are dry), and I just can’t seem to figure out what actually works.\n\nFor the longest time, I didn’t use anything at all, just my regular bathing soap (it weirdly never gave me acne). Then I went to a dermatologist, and she recommended the **Cetaphil Bright Healthy Radiance Creamy Cleanser...** and really that’s the *only* face wash that hasn’t messed up my skin. Everything else, like the Minimalist Salicylic Acid face wash, broke me out badly.\n\nShe also told me to use salicylic acid serum + Cleargel + another medicated cream for acne, but those only made things worse. Salicylic acid in general seems to destroy my skin.... both in face washes and serums. When I stopped using them, my skin actually improved.\n\nMoisturizers have been another nightmare: **Biosilk Moisturizer** broke me out, **Cetaphil DAM lotion** gave me heavy acne, **Neutrogena Hydro Boost**... same story\n\nSo right now, I don’t have a single moisturizer that works for me, and my cheeks are still dry. I’m sick of spending money on dermatologists (I honestly can’t keep affording it), and I don’t know where to turn.\n\nAnyone with similar experiences or recs? Thank you 😔",

I thought it's purging and after that my skin will be clean but then this happened - cystic acnes healed and they turned into these tiny bumps again😭\nSo it's been this never ending cycle of \nTiny bumps -- cystic acne -- tiny bumps \nAt the exact same part of my face.\nNothing seems to work for me. I visited dermatologist also and he advised me to go for comedones extraction. What should I do guys?? \nAlso I've lots of acne marks because of this and now I'm getting small acne scars on my face.\n\nHere are two things I'm looking for - \n\n1.
