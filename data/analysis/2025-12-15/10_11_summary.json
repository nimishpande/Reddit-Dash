      "content": "May 2025 —&gt; December 2025\nFinally learned how to love and take care of my curls in the past few months and I’m now obsessed with my hair. I had grown up always just brushing my hair out and then I learned how to use a flat iron and never looked back.. Until I started bleaching my hair. So I decided to put down the heat tools and learn how to do my natural hair.\nMy routine: \n1. I wash and condition with Redken Extreme Length (struggling to grow my hair because with it becoming healthier it also shrinks a lot) and usually do a hair mask every other washday. \n2. I use Sun Bum Leave in Conditioner, Sun Bum Curl Cream, Not Your Mother’s Gel, and a Bounce Curl Volume Brush. I also diffuse my hair upside down (I ❤️ volume) \n3. I scrunch and shake out my hair with Mielle Hair Oil\nI don’t do refreshes, I wash my hair around 2x a week, usually oil everyday, and I sleep in a silk bonnet. I also usually only wear my hair down to avoid breakage. Would love any hair growth tips!! \n",

      "content": "Early male, 20s. I have two toned lips but nothing really helped with that pigmentation, so I'm not gonna talk about it and I made peace with it. I'll review the spf and non-spf ones separately:\n\n#SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Chaptex spf 15 🟢\n\n- My derm prescribed me this when I had extremely dry and cracked lips (turned out to be cheilitis)\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, no fragrance, doesn't taste bitter, has humectant (D-Panthenol)\n\n- Has only spf 15. I see most people suggesting to use at least spf 30 or higher. I wish they made a spf 30 version\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##2. NMFe spf 40 🟢\n\n- Slightly glossy finish, easy to apply, has slight fragrance (I like it), has humectant (aloe vera extract)\n\n- It tastes bitter, that's the only complaint I have\n\n- Overall: 9.5/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##3. Sebamed spf 30 🔴\n\n- Has slight fragrance (didn't like it), very expensive, wasn't that moisturizing\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##4. Minimalist spf 30 (not in the picture) 🟢\n\n- Super cute packaging (but the lid broke after a few months 🥲), fragrance free, has humectant (Hyaluronic acid)\n\n- it's waxy, not quite easy to spread\n\n- Overall: 8.5/10. Will probably repurchase.\n\n___\n\n___\n\n#Non-SPF Lip balms:\n\n##1. Vaseline lip therapy Creme Brulee 🔴🟢\n\n- The caption under it says *for deliciously kissable lips* which hurts even more because it reminds me I have no-one to kiss 😭💀\n\n- It smells exactly like the Vaseline lip therapy cocoa butter one, it's very hard to differentiate the smell. Quite moisturizing, love the smell obv\n\n- Little heavy on the pocket (probably because it's imported?)\n\n- Overall: 8/10 (subtracted 1 for the caption). WNRP\n\n___\n\n##2. Vaseline skin protecting jelly (indian version) 🟢\n\n- Almost every Indian household has it lol. It's good, does its job\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WNRP\n\n___\n\n##3. Vaseline BLUESEAL pure petroleum jelly (imported) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT! I wish they sold this here in India everywhere instead of the skin protecting jelly\n\n- I bought it from Amazon but I was skeptical initially because of the picture the seller put on Amazon lol.\n\n- It's AMAZING! Seals the moisture very well and I also use it for slugging in the night. It's smoother and more buttery compared to the Indian version we get\n\n- I don't use it on the lips alone, I'll be mentioning my current routine which is helped me the most at the end of the post\n\n- Overall: 11/10. WRP! HG\n\n___\n\n##4. Nipcare 🔴\n\n- Bought it at the expense of weird looks from the pharmacy guy (didn't know it is used by lactating mothers for sore nipples)\n\n- It smells really awful (Lanolin, can't complain), didn't really do much for my lips and it's also not easy to spread it\n\n- Overall: 2/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##5. Laneige Lip sleeping mask (berry) 🟢\n\n- It's the GOAT 🐐 helped me so much with my dry lips. Not a big fan of that smell but it doesn't bother me. Leaves a white film on lips and I rub the entire thing off in the morning after waking up and there you go, plumpy soft lips!\n\n- It's probably a little overpriced but it lasts really long so can't complain ig\n\n- Overall: 10/10. WRP!\n\n___\n\n##6. LRP Cicaplast B5 baume 🔴\n\n- I didn't know you can also use it as a lip balm until I read some of the comments here but it didn't do anything for my lips and they felt even more dry in the morning \n\n- it's good as a barrier repair cream tho, helped me with redness and irritation near nose corners when I increased my tret frequency \n\n- Overall: 0/10 for lips, 8.5/10 for barrier repair\n\n___\n\n##7. Vaseline lip therapy tin (cocoa &amp; original) 🟢\n\n- It was a pain in the a*s to open the packaging but I bought the original one recently and it was super easy to open. Glad they changed its packaging (not sure about the cocoa one tho)\n\n- It's thick, does its job as an occlusive\n\n- Both of them are good. The cocoa one smells heavenly but I personally found the original one to be better.\n\n- Overall: 9/10. WRP\n\n___\n\n##8. Vaseline lip care total moisture (tube) (not in the picture) 🟢🔴\n\n- I love the smell, it's amazing! Very glossy finish and hydrates well. Affordable!\n\n- Hard to apply with that spherical base and I don't like touching it \n\n- Overall: 7/10. WRP\n___\n\n##9. Nova ayurvedic cream 🔴\n\n- My grandma suggested me this one. It's good with the hydration part but the fragrance is veryyy heavy and the lips kinda burn initially after application \n\n- Overall: 3/10. WNRP!\n\n___\n\n##Current routine:\n\nAM: NMFe\n\nPM: Laneige lip sleeping mask + Vaseline BLUESEAL \n\nThis routine helped me so much with dry lips. But not applying lip balm for even 1 day makes my lips dry again. My derm suggested that I use lip balm at least thrice a day and asked me to reapply whenever they felt dry. \n\n___\n\n##HONORARY MENTION: Brillare natural coconut lip balm \n\nWHAT DO I EVEN SAY? Hate is a strong word and I hate this lip balm with a passion. The texture of it is ugly af, it literally sticks to my finger. It smells like shit. I have tried applying it only once and was weirded out with the texture but still wanted to try and apply. This idiot doesn't even spread, it's that thick and sticky. THE WORST LIP BALM I'VE EVER SEEN 🏆",

I don’t know what products actually matter for this style, and the only thing that’s easy for me to find are glitters, but they’re almost always too chunky. I’m specifically looking for that very fine, delicate shimmer, not big sparkles\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\nWhat kind of products are usually used for looks like this?\n\nIs it more about toppers, shimmery bases, pigments, or technique?\n\nAre there any key products to start with without buying a lot?\n\nAny advice, product recommendations, or even keywords to search would really help.

I have dozens of these in my hair. A few times a week I sit down to search for these in my hair, and cut them off. I am worried it will start to make a difference in the length of my hair. I would love to avoid having to cut my hair like this. Does anyone have ANY tips on how to prevent these tiny single-strand knots? Is it OK if I just leave them there, and don't cut them off?? Because I would be down to do that, if there isn't a problem with it. it's SO FRUSTRATING because these knots are most often near the middle of the hair strand instead of the very end. I just cant resist cutting them off!!! Here is my routine:\n\n\\* 2 days a week I wash my hair, this is when I fully detangle by brushing it out with a Wet brush  \n\\* I let my hair air dry which takes several hours  \n\\* on wash day, I use two different leave in conditioners and curl cream  \n\\* every night I finger-detangle my hair (mostly) and put it into two braids  \n\\* every night I oil my hair while it is braided\n\nAs you can see, I try to minimize tangles as much as possible. But since my hair is so long, it's so hard, its practically always tangled. Please give me tips!",

      "content": "Posting in this in case it helps someone else! I have fine curls that when I followed a routine and thought I did everything right most of the time they would not clump, come out stringy, and fall flat and limp and thin. I tried different products in different orders,  on different levels of wetness, etc, and eventually chalked it up to humidity and things out of my control. \n\nI was under the impression that since my curls were fine it was very important to get as much water out of my hair as possible (I almost never diffuse, and airdry instead) as to not weigh them down. After applying my product on wet hair I would use a cotton shirt and scrunch upwards and pulse as much water out as possible. Doing this also removed a lot of product and therefore reduced the hold, and my clumps would get ruined. \n\nAnyone else find this to be the case? What I’m doing now is applying my product to super wet hair out of the shower, use a cotton shirt to scrunch and pulse upwards the same but this time only doing a couple passes, before I would do it continuously until I got it as dry as possible. So my hair now air dries more damp and my routine seems to be working alot better! Not perfect but a good improvement!\n\nHair type: fine, oily\n\nEvery other day: double shampoo roots with garnier curl nourish, (will sub out for Nizoral or ouai detox shampoo as needed based on buildup, usually atleast 1x/week) \n\nAs needed (maybe 1x/month): exfoliate with ouai scalp scrub and scalp brush\n\nOn soaking wet hair in order: Not your mothers leave in spray curl talk conditioner, tresseme extra hold volumizing mousse, and curlsmith in shower style fixer gel\n\nApplication method: with head tilted, rake in and praying hands with tension to form clumps, then gently scrunch upwards only a couple times. Use cotton shirt to scrunch upwards again to absorb some water but not all, and air dry damp, in the morning I scrunched out the cast. I didn’t pineapple or anything over night (it always gave me mixed results)",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

It definitely helped me keep acne at bay after 3 years or so of roaccutane in my teens. As many women, I realised it was affecting me in other ways though so when I finally just dropped it one day, the brain fog disappeared and my mental health has improved. Unfortunately, I did experience hormonal acne right away and while it is really just a few pimples and nowhere near full blown acne, it is a constant that I can't seem to fix. In my skincare routine I double cleanse, use Niacinamide, water based moisturiser and once a week I'll use retinol. SPF daily. I wash my bed sheets weekly, eat relatively healthily apart from my weakness for chocolate biscuits, work out very regularly. I also don't have any stress worth mentioning. I'm just at a loss, I was sure post pill acne would not last THIS long or rather at 26 I shouldn't be dealing with acne anymore. What helped you?",

Maui Shampoo and Conditioner for Lightweight Curls (green bottle). \n2. Uncle Funky's Curly Magic Curl Stimulator \n3. Curlsmith styling souffle (the smallest amount ever) and Curlsmith Hydrostyle Flexi Jelly. \nWash and style 2x per week. Do a mini plop before air drying. If I'm in a rush or want my curls to have more volume, I will diffuse but that is very rare. I would air dry to get closer to the look in this picture.",

But after spending way too much time reading studies, browsing forums, and listening to dermatologists explain this stuff, I realized something I hadn’t understood before: a lot of follicles don’t actually die, they just go dormant. That completely changed how I looked at the problem. If hair is inactive rather than gone, then things like stimulation and how anything actually reaches the follicle probably matter way more than just throwing random products on the scalp. I’m not claiming miracles or saying this fixes everything, just sharing something I really wish I’d understood earlier instead of assuming it was already too late.",
