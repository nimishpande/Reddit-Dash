      "content": "I saw the same hairstylist for the past 5 years and they’ve seen me through all my hair phases: pixie, short bob, long hair. The first photo is how they cut my hair the first time I saw them since I was growing out my pixie and realized I have naturally wavy hair. This was 2 years ago and I’ve since grew my hair out well below my shoulders. Looking back at pictures with my short hair, I really missed that era and went to cut my hair with them again. I showed them the reference and explained exactly how I want it to look but (third picture) this is what my hair looks like right now after trying to somewhat decently style it. The fourth photo is immediately after the haircut. I just don’t know what went wrong or what I should do… I realize my hair probably has to grow out before I do anything else with it but how do I go from this to the voluminous, wavy hair in the first and second photos? Any advice will be greatly appreciated 🙏\n\nMy usual styling routine are the Odele volumizing shampoo and conditioner, then the Twist by Ouidad lightweight styling gel and a styling foam. I usually diffuse my hair but it looked horrible with this haircut so I ended up straightening it. ",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I was prescribed Minoxidil 5% + topical Finasteride 0.1% by a dermatologist, and I did experience good hair regrowth. However, I failed to notice this improvement, maybe because the improvement was gradual, and I didn't keep track of my hair well enough.\n\nThis caused me to panic, and thus, I visited a different dermatologist, who suggested I discontinue Finasteride, as it wasn't ideal for my age. It's been about a year since I did so, and now, I notice that my hair thinning has been exacerbated.\n\nA hair transplant centre suggested 6 sessions of PRP to me, and said I will notice regrowth after about 3-6 sessions (each session being a month apart from the other). My research on Google, ChatGPT and Perplexity suggests that PRP will helpful, and will thicken my hair. On the other hand, though, many users on Reddit state that PRP isn't helpful at all.\n\nI am confused about what my next action should be. Please help me.",

I don’t want to fall into the pit of trendy skincare simply because it’s trendy. Drugstore products preferred but ik sometimes high end skincare just does better so really im open to everything :)\n\nTo start, here’s a little about my skin: I struggle with hormonal acne (currently taking spironolactone and have relatively clear skin atm) and acne scars. My skin type is combo but leaning more dry lately.\n\nMy goals: I want to focus on hydration and healthy looking skin, as well as helping with some acne scar discoloration if possible.\n\nMy current routine: AM: I use cereve hydrating facial cleanser, cereve vitamin c serum, bubble eye cream, and cereve moisturizer and LRP sunscreen. PM: cereve hydrating cleanser, a prescribed scar treatment or snail mucin toner from peach slices depending on the night, bubble eye cream and cereve moisturizer.",

In the mornings I’ve just been washing my face and moisturising and in the evenings I use the Cerave foaming cleanser, Skinoren and Cerave pm moisturiser. \n\nI’ve read on Reddit that Adapalene could potentially help with this but I’m wondering has anyone else had this same issue and how to go about it?

I hear the same reason “your ends are damaged.” After baby #3 I experienced a lot of hair thinning and hair loss. I got a real hair cut in August (I was 10 month PP) and they left it short, again, same reason. For context, I like my hair long like near my breasts. They usually leave it at my shoulders. I decided to suck it up, start from zero and go with the advice to trim it every 3-4 months and wait for new hair. My hair was a little bit longer recently of course and she trimmed it today. It’s shorter (duh) but it’s just so hard to believe that I will reach my goal of having long hair again if it gets trimmed every 4 months. My hair would need to grow more than what they cut, but I don’t know how much it grows. \n\nAnyway, really just ranting and hopeful that someone could give me like …hope lol.",

      "content": "I hear a lot that the holy grail for protecting hair with fabric is a silk satin. And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
