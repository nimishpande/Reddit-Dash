Need help with frizz and longer-lasting hold without weighing hair down.\n\nHello!\nI only discovered my true hair texture about 1.5 years ago, and it’s definitely been a journey. I’m still trying to find the best styling routine for my hair and struggling a bit with consistency.\n\nSo far, my favourite results come from using Sebastian Professional Potion 9 as a leave-in and the L’Oréal Curl Expression mousse. I love how soft my hair feels with this combo, but as you can probably tell from the pictures, I still get some frizz, and the curls don’t really hold well past day 2.\n\nI’ve tried Olaplex No.10 gel before, but even after scrunching out the cast, I never seem to get it right and I don’t love the final result.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has recommendations for gel products that improve hold without weighing hair down, or\nany other tweaks/products that could help with frizz and longevity. My hair is thick, and I believe it’s medium porosity.\n\nCurrent routine (2x per week):\n- Double wash with Wella Nutricurls shampoo\n- Wella Nutricurls mask\n- Out of the shower, I detangle with a Denman brush while hair is very wet\n- I don’t towel-dry at all, just scrunch out excess water with my hands\n- Sebastian Professional Potion 9 (scrunched in)\n- L’Oréal Curl Expression mousse (scrunched in)\n- Diffuse\n- Finish with a tiny bit of Wella Oil Reflections\n\nRefresh:\n- Re-wet hair with a spray bottle\n- Small amount of leave-in\n- Diffuse\n\nI usually sleep with a lose pineapple bun with a lose scrunchie.\n\nThanks so much in advance! 😊",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Feedback and suggestions please! I’ve tweaked this over the years, and finally feel like I’m in a good place where it’s not overly complicated, budget friendly, and my skin isn’t super reactive, but nothing is really being improved-just maintained if that makes sense? I still have extreme oiliness when I wake up in the morning and then about an hour after washing my face. The sebaceous filaments (at least I think that’s what they are?) make my t-zone feel/look like sandpaper. I only ever see a difference after I use lactic acid or a physical exfoliant, but don’t want to do that on a daily basis and dry my face out. There’s also redness and waxy bumps around my nose which may be seborrheic dermatitis, but it’s never been diagnosed by a derm. I have some splotchy redness on my cheeks, but never diagnosed rosacea. Looks more like irritated pores. I did try Paula’s Choice azaleic acid for a while and didn’t notice a difference. I’m 36, and starting to accept the fine lines around my mouth and eyes. I understand there isn’t anything very anti-aging in my routine, but I’m afraid to add a retinol and my skin become super stripped again. But maybe the retinol would help with the bumps if incorporated the right way? 🤷‍♀️\n\nJust to throw out what I also do consistently that might be suggested: change pillowcase frequently, drink as much water as possible (still probably drink too much coffee), put serums/essences on damp skin, dermaplane every month (moving towards decreasing this as a result of stopping minoxidil which caused excessive facial hair). I can’t really afford to add daily supplements to my routine although I did notice a difference when I took omegas. My skin has also improved (no more cystic acne) when I had my IUD removed and went off all hormonal BC. I’d love routine and product recommendations from others with this skin type! ❤️\n\nRoutine below:\n\nAM\n\nWash with \\*\\*LRP Toleraine Purifying Foam Cleanser (\\*\\*I’ve tried not washing and more milky cleaners and they don’t remove the dirt/oil and eventually cause breakouts).\n\nApply **Biossance Copper Peptides** on damp skin\n\n**Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence**\n\n**Cosrx Advanced Snail 92 All in One Cream** (I’ve found this to be a great prep for my skin tint)\n\n**Biossance Squalane Marine Algae Eye Cream**\n\n\\*spray thermal water between steps\\*\n\nPM\n\nDouble cleanse with \\*\\*Farmacy Green Clean Cleansing Balm (\\*\\*HG) and follow with the same LRP AM cleanser or **Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant**\n\nEvery two nights, **TO Lactic Acid 10%**\n\n**Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence**\n\nMoisturize with **Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer** (in tube)\\*\\*…still not sure how I feel about this. Like the consistency but may be contributing to cc’s.\n\n**Biossance Squalane Marine Algae Eye Cream**\n\nOnce a week, **TO Glycolic Acid 7%** and **LRP Cicaplast Balm** instead of Vanicream or whenever skin is feeling irritated.\n\n\\*\\*Also I live in a humid climate and have noticed a great deal of improvement in my skin when it’s summer/I’m out in the sun.",

Then, after washing hair, comb out hair while soaking wet and upside down, scrunching excess water out with an old tshirt. Then, add the tiniest pea sized amount of Aussie Miracle Curls frizz taming cream and emulsify in hands before scrunching it into all possible areas of hair. Finally, go at it with the Herbal Essences curl boosting mousse, scrunch that in and make sure there’s still no more excess water in the hair. Finally, diffuse fully! I’m using a satin bonnet tonight so my hair hopefully lasts a day before looking too awful, but this is the end result before bed! ",

I, unfortunately, attempted to reach silver at home(I have learned my lesson).\n\nMeaning, I put platinum colored semi-perm \"Adore Me\" on top of the fresh bleach. First photo is after I touched up my hair with bleach, second is the semi-perm color, and the last is my hair currently. Last photo is the bleach and dye in question. \n\nI did not like the result of this so to remedy, I bleached again.\n\nMy hair is now bubblegum pink\n\nI don't know enough about color theory to fix this so please help me. Do I need to bleach again? Is there a color I can use to cancel out the pink and get to blonde again?? Or at least not such a bright color? Please please any and all suggestions are much appreciated.

I was constantly adding new products, rotating serums, and trying every acne or calming product I saw recommended. My routine kept getting more complicated, but instead of improving, my skin slowly got worse—more redness, more breakouts, and a constant feeling of irritation.\n\n\n\nI realized I might be doing too much. I decided to stop using anything that wasn’t truly necessary and focus on a much more simplified routine.\n\nMorning: Cosrx Morning Cleanser, PC Retinol, Sunscreen\n\n\n\nEvening: Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm, Cosrx Cleanser, Ulike Led Mask, Cerave Moisturizer, Azelaic Acid\n\n\n\nI use the mask twice a week on cleansed skin, along with basic moisturizing. For me, it seems to work best as a supportive tool. But I’ve noticed that my skin recovers faster, redness fades more quickly, and overall inflammation feels more under control. This whole process really changed how I think about skincare. More products didn’t help me, but consistency, fewer actives, and giving my skin space to recover did.\n\n\n\nI’m curious if anyone else here has seen their skin improve after simplifying their routine. Would love to hear your thoughts.",

But even then, I haven’t achieved a single good result so far. Not to mention the day after washing. A disaster.\n\nMaybe someone here has a tip on what I could do differently?\n\nBy now I’ve tried leaving out regular conditioner and using only a leave-in conditioner.\n\nFlaxseed gel was okay, but it didn’t make a big difference either.\n\nAm I just too impatient? How long does it take to practice before you start seeing nice results?\n\nCompared to the pictures, I just feel very uncomfortable with my hair…",

      "content": "I’m relatively new to all this so please bear with me if I’m being dumb! \n\nI’ve struggled my whole life to find a routine that suits my skin. Everything I’d tried has either clogged my pores or made me break out. So I went through a long period of time where I just didn’t bother and didn’t care about skincare beyond just cleansing. The moisturiser is the part I always struggle with. \n\nRecently I felt the need to get into it but the problem is I have a lot of requirements. Firstly there’s the issue of so many products not interacting with my skin well. Secondly, I need the routine to be simple otherwise it becomes too frustrating and I’m less likely to stick with it. And lastly, I have really intense sensory issues when it comes to putting any kind of product on my skin. \n\nHowever, it seems I’ve finally found a combination that works: \n\n1. Cosrx salicylic acid gentle daily cleanser\n\n2. Glycerin heavily diluted with water as a moisturiser\n\n3. Vaseline to seal it all in \n\nWhile this combination of products has been working really nicely for me, I’ve found that it works even better when I only do it at night, and only rinse with water in the morning - this has been true for every other routine I’ve tried in the past. My skin is always nicer when I mostly just leave it alone (and my sensory issues are kept at bay too). \n\nThis is where my question comes in - if I do this routine at night, and then only rinse with water and wipe off with a damp face cloth in the morning, will that be removing the occlusive layer (Vaseline) enough for me to apply sunscreen effectively in the morning?

They only last me like 3 months max. \n\nLately though it’s often out of stock online and I’m looking for a less expensive alternative with similar or better performance. I’ve done a lot of research and I see this sub swears by Minimalist Vitamin C. I’m thinking of switching to Minimalist 16% Vitamin C (E &amp; Ferulic) since it’s about half the price of Agelite‑X. \n\nAlso I’ve also seen a lot of good reviews about Melano CC (though it seems pricey), but recommendations on that too would be great.\n\nWhat I am asking is it worth switching to Minimalist 16%? Or should I try Melano CC instead or should I just continue with Agelite-X?\n\nWould love to hear user thoughts on results and overall value. Thank you!",
