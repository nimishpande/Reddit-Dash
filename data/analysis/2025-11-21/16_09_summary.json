      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n**I'm a male in mind 20s.** I struggle with oily skin (especially on my nose) and persistent acne, which has left both old scars (red and brown) and ongoing redness on my cheeks and forehead. I also have pimples on my shoulders, upper back, and sometimes in the hair at the back of my neck.\n\nI mostly stay indoors, though I sometimes go out for work or errands. Currently, I don’t use any face washes or creams because I want a routine that’s affordable, simple, and doesn’t take too much time.\n\n**Photos:**\n\n\\- I’ll be sharing pics of both cheeks and my forehead (not my full face). The images are taken in bright light, but in indoor lighting the scars, marks, and tanning look more noticeable.\n\n**My goals:**\n\n* Reduce or remove red areas, dark spots, and pigmentation\n* Fade both old and newer acne scars\n* Prevent new breakouts (face, shoulders, neck)\n* Keep my routine basic and on a low budget\n\n**Extra info:**\n\n* Skin is oily, especially forehead and nose\n* New pimples appear less often now\n* Not sensitive, but avoid products that burn\n* Pimples also on shoulders, upper back, around neck/hairline\n* I have used benzoyl and tretinoin. Both works, but acne keep coming back. benzoyl did peel of skin, it's irritating, but I didn't monitor much, so don't know if it removed acne scars.\n\n**Product questions:**\n\n* I’m planning to buy the beminimalist Niacinamide 10% Face Serum (10ml to try first). Would it suit oily, acne-prone skin like mine? How should I use it, and how often?\n* And also thinking of buying a vitamin C serum for dark spots.\n* If you notice pigmentation or uneven tone in the images, which cream or serum should I use for that (and for tanning/dullness)?\n* I don’t want to go for brands or creams with a shady background or too much marketing hype. Please suggest genuinely good options.\n\n**What I need:**\n\n* Daily routine, max 2-3 steps (just cleanser, serum, moisturizer or SPF is ideal)\n* Affordable, India available options\n* Quick tips to reduce redness before events\n* **How to tackle pigmentation, dark spots, acne scars with budget products (if OTC works, or when to see a dermatologist)**\n* Suggestions for pigmentation/tan and dark spots (please mention 2-3 product options in different price ranges so I can pick based on my budget)\n\n**Thanks a lot for reading!**\n\nAny honest, practical advice, routines, or product suggestions are appreciated. I hope I’ve covered all details. Ask if you need more context.",

      "content": "Hi guys, this is my first time posting on this subreddit. Please be kind. \n\nI wanted to ask for some advice on routines or products that could help reduce my keratosis pilaris on my arms and back. I’ve had KP since I was around 11–12 (currently 26) and honestly never paid much attention to it, but lately I’ve been wanting to know what smooth skin even feels like because I don’t think I’ve ever experienced that (at least not in my conscious memory). My skin tone on the arms are also a bit patchy and I am not sure why. \n\nI have attached from photos here, forgive my very weird angles I was trying to do this on my own. \n\nWhat I’m currently doing:\n-I use a regular body wash.\n-I exfoliate with a basic coffee scrub once or twice a week, been doing it for a while now, maybe a year? \n-I shower at night because I wake up way too late to do anything but run to work.\n-I’m not consistent with sunscreen on my arms since they’re usually covered.\n-I was gifted the Paula’s Choice salicylic acid body lotion (purple tube) and the small SA toner. I use them, but the lotion feels greasy on my skin. I live in a very humid climate so I sweat easily and it sometimes causes small pimples under clothing. You can see the scars of a couple in the later photos where I sort of scratched my arms. Before that, I wouldn’t get pimples on my arms often unless I use some sort of greasy/heavy lotion. \n-To moisturise I currently use a light Nacific AHA/BHA toner because I read people with sweaty/oily skin may benefit from that if lotions or moisturizers are making you sweat. \n\nI haven’t really explored much skin care for KP yet so that’s why I would like to request if y’all have some suggestions or what worked for you. \n\nCan you recommend any non-greasy and effective alternatives to SA/AHA lotions/bodywashes/whatever else is there for KP, or other ingredients I could try? Also open to routine suggestions. I don’t have access to a derm where I live currently. ",

My nose is usually shiny and a bit oily, as well as my under eye area, whereas the rest of my face seems normal to dry. It also easily burns/stings/reacts to products. I bought the CeraVe Foaming Cleanser a year ago without knowing much about skincare and every time I use it it feels really stripping and my face gets a little bit itchy and dry. I started using the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser 2 weeks ago after hearing good things about it.

I need them gone so I don't massacre my skin :)\n\nI think I have combination skin? my cheeks are normal but my forehead and nose get pretty oily probably as a reaction to dehydration since my forehead simultaneously feels a bit tight. acne wise my face is pretty clear but at some points in my cycle I get small spots on my forehead that take care of themselves, and very occasionally I get one deep and painful pimple that takes like a week to come to the surface. usually on my chin or somewhere on my nose. I don't wear makeup other than a tiny bit of concealer on blemishes \n\nthe routine in order:\n- CeraVe hydrating cleanser (new addition, I used to use aveeno non foaming oat cleanser but that felt drying somehow)\n- TO glycolic acid 1-2 times a week\n- haruharu black rice toner\n- beauty of joseon red bean water gel\n- Cetaphil moisturizing lotion\n- rosehip oil mixed into one of the moisturizers (new)\n- sometimes a tiny amount of the CeraVe SA smoothing cream where any blackheads are\n- skin aqua UV gel SPF 50 PA++++\n\nI used to use the CeraVe salicylic acid face wash but that did absolutely nothing as far as I can remember. I added the hydrating cleanser, Cetaphil moisturizer and rosehip oil to try to alleviate the tightness but once again none of it seems to help. I got the smoothing cream for my legs and arms which is what it's intended for I believe but my face skin doesn't react badly so I use a little to see if it helps (it doesn't)\n\nother than the chemical exfoliation, once or twice a week after washing my face I'll use a towel to gently physically exfoliate my chin. which also does not seem to help ",
