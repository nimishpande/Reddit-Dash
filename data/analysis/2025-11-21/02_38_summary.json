      "content": "I’ve been taking 1 mg of finasteride per day orally for 5 months, and 4 drops of minoxidil per day with a glass of water (also orally).\nTwo months ago, I increased the minoxidil dose to 6 drops a day, since I hadn’t experienced any side effects up to that point. That’s still the case now.\n\nFor the past month, I’ve been losing around 100–200 hairs per day when washing or running my hands through my hair. Before this second shedding phase, it was a maximum of about 5 per day.\nSince the second shedding started, I’ve also noticed a change in my hair texture—some strands stay very straight while others are becoming kind of wavy. This happened to me during my teenage years too; I had almost forgotten about it. Also my hair becomes darker.\n\nCompared to two months ago, I personally don’t notice much new growth anymore (mainly because of the long shedding phase I think), but friends who see me every 2–3 weeks keep telling me each time that my hair looks denser and fuller than the last time they saw me.\n\nI’m excited to see how things continue and hope the regrowth will come back even stronger than before. But even now, I’m extremely happy and have already regained more than I ever dreamed of in only five months.\nThank you to everyone in this forum who “convinced” me to start the treatment. ❤️",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I’ve tried salicylic acid, BHA’s, exfoliating etc and it only seems to clean the skin but not the actual build up thats inside the pores.\n\nMy current routine is as follows, in order: Sulphur soap AM and PM, Phytic acid serum AM and PM and then an oil free moisturiser AM and PM. When I shower, I use a PH balancing face wash from dermalogica, but this isn’t every day.\n\nAny help or recommendations are appreciated",

Hair, nails, and skin are all doing fantastic.\n\nBreathe through my nose.\n\nI’ve tried a lot of products, Asian beauty tends to work better for me but I’m open to Western brands as well.\n\nI’ve tried periods of no exfoliating and no lip balms to see if it helps. The only combo that has worked so far is RiRe Bubble Lip Mask followed by A'PIEU Honey &amp; Milk Lip Oil, and that gets me almost a whole day of happy, smooth lips where I don’t have to constantly moisturize and/or can apply lip products without a layer of dead skin forming. If I don’t exfoliate sometimes the Honey &amp; Milk lip oil can create the dead skin issue, but not every time.\n\nSide question, is it safe to use a bubble lip mask every day? Physical exfoliants seem to be too rough and at the same time far less effective.\n\nMy other mainstays are Vitamin E stick, Nivea Moisture Pure Color, Shiseido Water Lip, and the Laneige lip mask. CNP Laboratory Propolis Lipcerin seems to make my lips burn, I only used it twice so it might be a coincidence but if I’m allergic to something then something in that would be my first guess.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that anything with a significant quantity of bees wax makes everything 10x worse",

I’ve noticed it got really bad after I stopped taking birth control pills and switched to an implant so I don’t know if that has anything to do with it. I’ve always had acne prone skin and ever since I turned 19 I noticed that if I got a pimple it would leave a dark mark (regardless of if I touched it or not) And I’ll have pimples that will never ever go away and will just stay as a bump\n\nWould a facial help? What else would help to get rid of dark spots left by pimples?? Or would it just be a waste of time? I have pretty sensitive skin that is oily on my forehead and nose but dry on the lower half of my face. What else would you suggest?

I did my first Accutane cycle about 1.5 years ago.\n\nMy dosing schedule was:  \nMonth 1: 20 mg  \nMonths 2–5: 40 mg  \nMonth 6: 60 mg\n\nSo in total I took around 7200 mg. My weight at the time was 80 kg, so the recommended cumulative dose for me should’ve been around 9600–12,000 mg. Meaning my first course was underdosed.\n\nI have had acne for 14 years around now.\n\nI first got put on benzoyl peroxide, which did not work. Then they put me on Erythromycine-10 which worked for around a month until it stopped working.\n\nThen we waited 5 months and I moved countries, where they gave me clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide and after a month they started giving me doxycycline for 2 weeks. Of course this all did not work.\n\nThey tried more things with 1.5 months of doxycycline, which also did not work, yet destroyed my stomach. They then recommended accutane and I did this cycle.\n\nI had to go back to my own country, so I did not get another prescription but I had a month or a little over a month of pills left. 40MG (around 40 capsules in my possession).\n\nI had no side effects during these 6 months which were not solved. (slight dryness under lips which went away with cream 3 times a day and vaseline twice, sunburn solved by SPF and umbrella at all times, wounds I got a human placenta gel to not scar, my backpain was there but with fish oil it kinda got better but yeah the back pain was the sole thing that I felt. Honestly the backpain was manageable it was like a 3/10 just in the morning. Outside of these sides, my blood was good and I did not feel anything. I felt like my skin was just a bit thin, but nothing serious. If I would be on it forever, i wouldn't even realize.\n\nNow we go back to now: I got 1 cystic pimple on my arm. I used to get these once every 3 months and they would last for 3 weeks and scar me for months, up to even a year (up to permanent) and the acne got back slightly, not as bad as it used to be but close.\n\nAfter having close to perfect skin for 1.5 years after 13 years of acne this is a mental shock and I started my remaining pills. and went to the doctor, to recommend me to a derm for my acne.\n\nTo my shock my doctor told me that \"my acne is not bad and that I should just live with it as others live with their acne all their life\" I replied that \"I did it before, I had no sides, and also I do not want to live with a scarred face forever, and I want to have good skin, and this is the only way to get it.\"\n\nShe said that accutane or derm is only used in very serious cases and she does not deem my case as serious and that I am overexaggerating.\n\nI have a full back of scars, which is so hideous I don't want to take my shirt off, my face is sort of fine not the best, and my legs are hideous too, full of scars. full!\n\nI feel so terrible; I do not get why she does not want to even recommend me to a derm. Whether I get accutane or not depends on the derm, but even the recommendation to go see one was not in her thoughts.\n\nWhat do you guys think based on the picture and my information? am I overexaggerating?",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n\n\n**I'm a 25-year-old male from Rajasthan.** I struggle with oily skin (especially on my nose) and persistent acne, which has left both old scars (red and brown) and ongoing redness on my cheeks and forehead. I also have pimples on my shoulders, upper back, and sometimes in the hair at the back of my neck.\n\n\n\nI mostly stay indoors, though I sometimes go out for work or errands. Currently, I don’t use any face washes or creams because I want a routine that’s affordable, simple, and doesn’t take too much time.\n\n\n\n**Photos:**\n\n\\- I’ll be sharing pics of both cheeks and my forehead (not my full face). The images are taken in bright light, but in indoor lighting the scars, marks, and tanning look more noticeable.\n\n\n\n**My goals:**\n\n* Reduce or remove red areas, dark spots, and pigmentation  \n* Fade both old and newer acne scars  \n* Prevent new breakouts (face, shoulders, neck)\n* Keep my routine basic and on a low budget\n\n\n\n**Extra info:**\n\n* Skin is oily, especially forehead and nose  \n* New pimples appear less often now  \n* Not sensitive, but avoid products that burn  \n* Pimples also on shoulders, upper back, around neck/hairline\n\n\n\n**Product questions:**\n\n* I’m planning to buy the beminimalist Niacinamide 10% Face Serum (10ml to try first). Would it suit oily, acne-prone skin like mine? How should I use it, and how often?\n* If you notice pigmentation or uneven tone in the images, which cream or serum should I use for that (and for tanning/dullness)?\n* I don’t want to go for brands or creams with a shady background or too much marketing hype. Please suggest genuinely good options.\n\n\n\n**What I need:**\n\n* Daily routine, max 2-3 steps (just cleanser, serum, moisturizer or SPF is ideal)\n* Affordable, India available options  \n* Quick tips to reduce redness before events\n* How to tackle pigmentation and dark spots with budget products (if OTC works, or when to see a dermatologist)\n* Suggestions for pigmentation/tan and dark spots (please mention 2-3 product options in different price ranges so I can pick based on my budget)\n\n\n\n**Thanks a lot for reading!**\n\n\n\nAny honest, practical advice, routines, or product suggestions are appreciated. I hope I’ve covered all details. Ask if you need more context.",

I use a product called Wavy Curl Creme most of the time, which seems to work pretty well the first week I use it after not using it for a while. However, after about a week it stops working as well - my hair becomes frizzy, undefined, flat and pretty uninspiring. The curls also don't seem to be forming that well either. \n\nI've also tried the Zielinski and Rozen curl cream which didn't give me the results I wanted, although I'm not sure whether I'm putting enough in. \n\nI've tried Curlsmith hydro style flexi jelly as well, which seems to make my hair more frizzy, but I can't tell for sure. \n\nI use Yves Rocher Curl shampoo and conditioner a couple times a week\n\nIt might be useful to know that my scalp has felt quite dry and flaky recently, so maybe these products have something to do with this?\n\nI use a diffuser on the medium heat setting every morning and scrunch the cast out after 15 minutes. \n\n  \n**My plea is this: what can I do to help my curls return to their perfect pattern and volumous state?** \n\n  \nI need a surefire routine (that isn't too time consuming or complicated) to perfect my curls in the morning. I'm SO tired of having these disappointing curls everyday! \n\n  \nI would be soo grateful if you could recommend some good styling tips / routine tips / alternative products / general advice.\n\n**Also**, some advice on whether these products i'm considering getting would be helpful for my hair is very much welcomed:\n\n\\- La biosthetique curl activating conditioning spray (I think there's a sulphate in the ingredients, though. Is this bad?)\n\n\\- La biosthetique curl defining styling fluid\n\n\\- Moroccanoil thickening lotion \n\n\\- Bounce curl define edge lift brush\n\n\\- Moroccanoil purifying scrub (for scalp issues)\n\n  \nAn important thing to also note is that I am wetting my hair every morning in the shower and applying the products in the same amount as the day before, as according to the Wavy founder, the creme washes out easily. \n\n  \n**Thank you SO much** ",

I have never found anything that really helps, apart from the conditioner I use which my hair seems to like more than anything else I've tried - the tresemme deep conditioning mask. Basically I have super coarse super thick hair with a wave pattern that likes to frizz. I no longer heat treat my hair, and have dyed it a handful of times with henna but not for a long time (years now). See attached photos for reference, I'm finding it completely unmanageable at the moment and am 5 months postpartum so struggling a bit with it tangling and becoming a mess. At this point I just throw it up in a messy bun but its so hard to get out at the end of the day and comb it through\nthrough. Are there any products anyone with hair like mine can recommend? I dont mind the price tag at this point, I've never spent much on hair products but I'm willing to splash out a bit if it makes my life easier. I'm getting a haircut this weekend to take off the split ends and put some layers back in so hoping that will help a bit. Thanks in advance and please be kind, I'm just a postpartum mum trying to feel a bit better about myself 🥹",
