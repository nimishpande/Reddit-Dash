      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi guys, this is my first time posting on this subreddit. Please be kind. \n\nI wanted to ask for some advice on routines or products that could help reduce my keratosis pilaris on my arms and back. I’ve had KP since I was around 11–12 (currently 26) and honestly never paid much attention to it, but lately I’ve been wanting to know what smooth skin even feels like because I don’t think I’ve ever experienced that (at least not in my conscious memory). My skin tone on the arms are also a bit patchy and I am not sure why. \n\nI have attached from photos here, forgive my very weird angles I was trying to do this on my own. \n\nWhat I’m currently doing:\n-I use a regular body wash.\n-I exfoliate with a basic coffee scrub once or twice a week, been doing it for a while now, maybe a year? \n-I shower at night because I wake up way too late to do anything but run to work.\n-I’m not consistent with sunscreen on my arms since they’re usually covered.\n-I was gifted the Paula’s Choice salicylic acid body lotion (purple tube) and the small SA toner. I use them, but the lotion feels greasy on my skin. I live in a very humid climate so I sweat easily and it sometimes causes small pimples under clothing. You can see the scars of a couple in the later photos where I sort of scratched my arms. Before that, I wouldn’t get pimples on my arms often unless I use some sort of greasy/heavy lotion. \n-To moisturise I currently use a light Nacific AHA/BHA toner because I read people with sweaty/oily skin may benefit from that if lotions or moisturizers are making you sweat. \n\nI haven’t really explored much skin care for KP yet so that’s why I would like to request if y’all have some suggestions or what worked for you. \n\nCan you recommend any non-greasy and effective alternatives to SA/AHA lotions/bodywashes/whatever else is there for KP, or other ingredients I could try? Also open to routine suggestions. I don’t have access to a derm where I live currently. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nHope you are well!\n\nAfter a bad waxing incident 2ish years ago, I have since had dark spots and scarring marks on my upper thighs. I'm of south asian ethnicity, and my skin type is between 4 to 5 on the Fitzpatrick scale.\n\nI've tried a few treatments, but I'm looking for something that may be more effective.\n\nI talked to a derm a few months ago, and she said that waxing is no longer a viable option for me on my legs due to the scarring, so I should either switch over to shaving or laser. I'm currently doing laser treatments (third session is upcoming).\n\nI'm looking for advice on how to reduce my dark spots and hyperpigmentation. I have tried the following:\n\n\\* AmLactin for 8 weeks (did nothing)\n\n\\* Foliculitis medication (did nothing, was misdiagnosed earlier)\n\n\\* [Naturium The Smoother Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Body Wash - 16.9 fl oz](https://www.target.com/p/naturium-the-smoother-glycolic-acid-exfoliating-body-wash-16-9-fl-oz/-/A-83754794#lnk=sametab) ( been doing for roughly 2 months, everyday, seems to have reduced dark spots slightly)\n\n\\* SkinMedica Even and Correct Brightening Treatment Pads - 60 Pads (did in summer for \\~3 weeks, every morning, was told to stop because of foliculitis medication, but restarted last week, a few weeks after finding out I was misdiagnosed -- doesn't seem to have done anything yet, may be too early to tell)\n\nAs for the rest, I usually moisturize myself with Aveeno Lavender body lotion right after I step out of the shower directly on my wet skin. I feel like it feels good on my upper body, but I'm wondering if I should be doing something else for my legs.\n\nI saw that [Gold Bond Retinol Overnight Unscented Face and Body Lotion - 7oz](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-retinol-overnight-body-lotion-unscented-7oz/-/A-86416862#lnk=sametab) was recommended in this sub in a few threads, but I'm curious to know if there are other options I should consider and how effective it might be on medium-darker skin tones?\n\nAnother thing to note -- it seems like when I used to push out my ingrown hairs, a circular reddish spot forms in the area (bad habit, haven't really done it since), so I'm not sure if that could be an indication of a damaged skin barrier, where I might need to look into ceramides?\n\n**TL;DR:** I have a medium-dark skin tone, and I'm looking to fade hyperpigmentation and scarring from a bad waxing incident 2 years ago. Looking for recommendations on treatments / moisturizers / creams for after-shower in the evening / night.\n\nThank you! :)",

But since it's winter now and it's too cool, I see my full arms getting very dry and dark due to the weather. \n\nI have an event coming up and I was planning on doing a shave for my full arms instead of wax, and this is my first time doing it. \n\nAs per youtube videos, these are the steps: \n1. Wash with warm water\n2. Scrub/exfoliate \n3. Use a shaving cream/gel/foam or a body wash foam \n4. Then shave with a good razor on the side of ingrowth hair\n5. Seal it off with moisturizer once shaved (I will be using bioderma atoderme) \n\nMy confusion here is as its winter can I still exfoliate my skin or would it be too harsh? I asked chatgpt and it asked me to avoid scrubbing or exfoliating but as for the info online scrubbing/exfoliating helps with any clogs etc. This is my first time and I am completely confused how to start. \n\nI need your help pretty ladies. Please let me know what I must do and how to. Do I shave just with shaving product or go with scrubbing/exfoliating first? Please keep in mind this is winter season so what's the best. Your routines would truly help, let me know what works the best for you and safe 🩷 ",

The bangs fell perfectly. The layers aligned. My inner teen whispered, “I didn't chose the scene life. The scene life chose me.” I blinked, and suddenly I time traveled back to 2007. I stared into the mirror at what could of been my MySpace legacy. \n\nChaos: maximum\nEgo: inflated\nLife choices: questionable.\n\nBut let’s get serious for a second: addiction is a disease. It’s degrading and can make you feel completely hopeless. If you're also struggling with addiction, I just want you to know that there is hope. There is light at the end of the tunnel. I am living proof.\n\nOk, back to chaos: here’s a video of me flaunting my hilariously accidental scene-y weeny hairdo.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for me as I continue my dematting journey to keep my hair from reviving an extinct subculture?\n\nLegal Disclaimer:\nThis post was drafted with the assistance of ChatGPT.

I have Wet Ones anti bac wipes in my bag and I’m dying to wipe my face with one, my only other option is the hand soap in the bathroom which I think is much worse but I can’t confirm that.\n\nMy face is so gross and oily, I haven’t been able to do my tretanoin either and I’m really feeling it and breaking out like crazy. There’s no shop I can buy wipes from and no one to drop anything down to me. Please let me know if I’m gonna fuck my face up haha",

Products Used\n\t•\tLeave-in: Shea Butter leave-in conditioner\n\t•\tCurl cream: Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream\n\t•\tGel: None\n\n3. Application Method\n\t•\tApplied leave-in + curl cream on damp/wet hair\n\t•\tScrunched\n\t•\tNo gel used to seal the curls\n\n4. Drying Method\n\t•\tAir-dried\n\t•\tAlso tried using a T-shirt to dry\n\n5. Night Routine\n\t•\tPut hair into a bonnet\n\t•\tSlept on a cotton pillowcase \n\nMy questions:\n\t1.\tHow do you style fine 3B curls without making them feel tacky or heavy?\n\t2.\tAm I using too much leave-in / mousse even when I think I’m barely using any?\n\t3.\tShould I be styling on soaking wet hair only?\n\t4.\tWhat are the best lightweight leave-ins or gels for fine curls?\n\t5.\tIs it normal that only air-drying with no product looks good, but everything else ruins the curl pattern?\n\t6.\tHow do you maintain volume without the curls separating or getting frizzy?\n\nAny product suggestions or step-by-step routines would be massively appreciated.\nI feel like my curls could look amazing with the right technique — I just haven’t figured out the formula yet.\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n\n\n**I'm a 25-year-old male from Rajasthan.** I struggle with oily skin (especially on my nose) and persistent acne, which has left both old scars (red and brown) and ongoing redness on my cheeks and forehead. I also have pimples on my shoulders, upper back, and sometimes in the hair at the back of my neck.\n\n\n\nI mostly stay indoors, though I sometimes go out for work or errands. Currently, I don’t use any face washes or creams because I want a routine that’s affordable, simple, and doesn’t take too much time.\n\n\n\n**Photos:**\n\n\\- I’ll be sharing pics of both cheeks and my forehead (not my full face). The images are taken in bright light, but in indoor lighting the scars, marks, and tanning look more noticeable.\n\n\n\n**My goals:**\n\n* Reduce or remove red areas, dark spots, and pigmentation  \n* Fade both old and newer acne scars  \n* Prevent new breakouts (face, shoulders, neck)\n* Keep my routine basic and on a low budget\n\n\n\n**Extra info:**\n\n* Skin is oily, especially forehead and nose  \n* New pimples appear less often now  \n* Not sensitive, but avoid products that burn  \n* Pimples also on shoulders, upper back, around neck/hairline\n\n\n\n**Product questions:**\n\n* I’m planning to buy the beminimalist Niacinamide 10% Face Serum (10ml to try first). Would it suit oily, acne-prone skin like mine? How should I use it, and how often?\n* If you notice pigmentation or uneven tone in the images, which cream or serum should I use for that (and for tanning/dullness)?\n* I don’t want to go for brands or creams with a shady background or too much marketing hype. Please suggest genuinely good options.\n\n\n\n**What I need:**\n\n* Daily routine, max 2-3 steps (just cleanser, serum, moisturizer or SPF is ideal)\n* Affordable, India available options  \n* Quick tips to reduce redness before events\n* How to tackle pigmentation and dark spots with budget products (if OTC works, or when to see a dermatologist)\n* Suggestions for pigmentation/tan and dark spots (please mention 2-3 product options in different price ranges so I can pick based on my budget)\n\n\n\n**Thanks a lot for reading!**\n\n\n\nAny honest, practical advice, routines, or product suggestions are appreciated. I hope I’ve covered all details. Ask if you need more context.",
