      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

There’s a lot of products out there right now that promises to do this and that - the majority seems to be aimed at a younger demographic, with very few anti-aging, age-defying lines.

      "content": "Hi guys, this is my first time posting on this subreddit. Please be kind. \n\nI wanted to ask for some advice on routines or products that could help reduce my keratosis pilaris on my arms and back. I’ve had KP since I was around 11–12 (currently 26) and honestly never paid much attention to it, but lately I’ve been wanting to know what smooth skin even feels like because I don’t think I’ve ever experienced that (at least not in my conscious memory). My skin tone on the arms are also a bit patchy and I am not sure why. \n\nI have attached from photos here, forgive my very weird angles I was trying to do this on my own. \n\nWhat I’m currently doing:\n-I use a regular body wash.\n-I exfoliate with a basic coffee scrub once or twice a week, been doing it for a while now, maybe a year? \n-I shower at night because I wake up way too late to do anything but run to work.\n-I’m not consistent with sunscreen on my arms since they’re usually covered.\n-I was gifted the Paula’s Choice salicylic acid body lotion (purple tube) and the small SA toner. I use them, but the lotion feels greasy on my skin. I live in a very humid climate so I sweat easily and it sometimes causes small pimples under clothing. You can see the scars of a couple in the later photos where I sort of scratched my arms. Before that, I wouldn’t get pimples on my arms often unless I use some sort of greasy/heavy lotion. \n-To moisturise I currently use a light Nacific AHA/BHA toner because I read people with sweaty/oily skin may benefit from that if lotions or moisturizers are making you sweat. \n\nI haven’t really explored much skin care for KP yet so that’s why I would like to request if y’all have some suggestions or what worked for you. \n\nCan you recommend any non-greasy and effective alternatives to SA/AHA lotions/bodywashes/whatever else is there for KP, or other ingredients I could try? Also open to routine suggestions. I don’t have access to a derm where I live currently. ",

      "content": "this is a last resort but i need help. \ni’ve had acne since i started puberty. Ive always chalked it up to teenage acne, but im 21 and it hasn’t gone away. I’ve developed pretty bad dermatillomania as a result and i know it’s making it worse but if i didn’t have anything to pick at it wouldnt. It’s definitely partly hormonal/stress related but i don’t think that’s the entirety. Birth control didn’t make a different but i am on spiro 50mg, and it has definitely helped with the big gross inflamed ones, but i still struggle with clogged pores, closed comadones, whiteheads and red spots. \nNot only that but i have hEDS which makes my skin extremely sensitive. Most topical products don’t agree with me. Tret, Benzoyl Peroxide and adapalane have dried the f out of my skin or damaged my skin barrier. Tret nearly had my skin sloughing off no matter how i used it. Salicylic acid and MAYBE clindamycin are the only two that haven’t, but i haven’t seen much results. My skin is generally dry and it’s hard to find acne products that don’t make that worse. \nmy routine right now, which i would like to get help with because i don’t think all the products are necessarily the best is \nmorning: \nThe ordinary Glucoside Foaming cleanser (want to try a different one, any gentle cleansers that help with acne, are non comedogenic, non drying and avoid alcohol, this is something i’m looking at changing most importantly) \nITK milky toner (i like this, would like to keep) \nThe Ordinary 2%aloe 2%NAG solution \nclindamycin 1% lotion (don’t know if this is beneficial or not) \nLa Roche Posay double repair moisturizer \nnight: same cleanser \nElf woah glow 30spf primer \nThe ordinary salicylic acid 2%\nByoma Barrier repair treatment (i’ve heard this is not recommended for acne prone skin, would like a better barrier treatment) \nThe ordinary Natural Moisturizing factors+beta glucan \nif my skin is really dry i add a layer of the la roache posay as needed \nLion Pair acne spot cream (tiktok product yes but i’ve seen good results and i like it a lot) \nWould love some insight as to what’s potentially causing my acne and a good routine for my skin type. I’m just now trying to take it seriously so plz don’t be mean. I also can’t spend a lot of money so in the lower/medium price range. Also i’ve heard azeliac acid is good? what do yall think. i would appreciate any insight. ",

Stay healthy, hydrated, use clean products, try new things if you want, but most importantly - love yourself, you’re beautiful. YES, yes, you are!!And you’re worth everything.\n\nIt’s something I wished to hear so much, sought after, and even now am working on fully embracing, but if you’re reading this - I want you to know that you’re doing so well, and you’re absolutely lovely and perfect &lt;3\n\nHonestly, idk exactly what I did, as I didn’t really use any creams or products. It was kind of mild-medium at times for me, though has been getting less and less with time. It may be to do with getting more sleep, which I think really helped me.",

I have Wet Ones anti bac wipes in my bag and I’m dying to wipe my face with one, my only other option is the hand soap in the bathroom which I think is much worse but I can’t confirm that.\n\nMy face is so gross and oily, I haven’t been able to do my tretanoin either and I’m really feeling it and breaking out like crazy. There’s no shop I can buy wipes from and no one to drop anything down to me. Please let me know if I’m gonna fuck my face up haha",

I was thinking micro bangs but then remembered that I’m probably unfit to make a drastic decision now and I should rather order clip-ins online. But I don’t really know what my hair color is. Can someone help me out?\n\nAlso, I‘m still getting a haircut today and unsure what to ask for. I desire a big change, probably because I feel bad. I was thinking short bob but I have quite masculine, at least very classical and straight facial features so I like the contrast of having long hair. \nI hate to and generally don’t style my hair and now I just have to wash it and gravity does the rest.\n\nGenerally I‘m not a regretful person and I wore shorter hair before, looked okay. I like that it looks like a hairstyle and not just hair when it’s shorter but I already feel unattractive atm and I don’t want to make it worse… I don’t know what kind of advice I‘m looking for here, maybe someone can derive from whats seen of my face shape what actually objectively suits me?

Just didn’t want the grey toners. Hair usually lifts to a 10 easy since my hair is a dark/dirty blonde. \n\nHair stylist said she used 20 volume on my hair and isn’t sure why it didn’t lift well. I was in and out in two hours. Felt rushed. I also wanted heavy brightness around my face frame and mentioned foils usually got me there, and she said the painting method would brighten me right up and that the hairs up front were too brittle for bleach (i have naturally course hair which can be mistaken as brittle but my hair handles bleach really well per my previous hair stylist.) \n\nShe said she’d be happy to retone but won’t offer to just put some foils in around my hairline to brighten me up, that’s not usually something she offers and said it could be hormones, medication, vitamins, or environment as the reason my hair lifted so dark. \n\nWhat do you guys think? I’m not sure what to do lol, but i don’t believe i got anywhere close to what i asked for. ",
