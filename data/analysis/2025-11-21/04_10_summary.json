      "content": "I’ve been taking 1 mg of finasteride per day orally for 5 months, and 4 drops of minoxidil per day with a glass of water (also orally).\nTwo months ago, I increased the minoxidil dose to 6 drops a day, since I hadn’t experienced any side effects up to that point. That’s still the case now.\n\nFor the past month, I’ve been losing around 100–200 hairs per day when washing or running my hands through my hair. Before this second shedding phase, it was a maximum of about 5 per day.\nSince the second shedding started, I’ve also noticed a change in my hair texture—some strands stay very straight while others are becoming kind of wavy. This happened to me during my teenage years too; I had almost forgotten about it. Also my hair becomes darker.\n\nCompared to two months ago, I personally don’t notice much new growth anymore (mainly because of the long shedding phase I think), but friends who see me every 2–3 weeks keep telling me each time that my hair looks denser and fuller than the last time they saw me.\n\nI’m excited to see how things continue and hope the regrowth will come back even stronger than before. But even now, I’m extremely happy and have already regained more than I ever dreamed of in only five months.\nThank you to everyone in this forum who “convinced” me to start the treatment. ❤️",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Hair, nails, and skin are all doing fantastic.\n\nBreathe through my nose.\n\nI’ve tried a lot of products, Asian beauty tends to work better for me but I’m open to Western brands as well.\n\nI’ve tried periods of no exfoliating and no lip balms to see if it helps. The only combo that has worked so far is RiRe Bubble Lip Mask followed by A'PIEU Honey &amp; Milk Lip Oil, and that gets me almost a whole day of happy, smooth lips where I don’t have to constantly moisturize and/or can apply lip products without a layer of dead skin forming. If I don’t exfoliate sometimes the Honey &amp; Milk lip oil can create the dead skin issue, but not every time.\n\nSide question, is it safe to use a bubble lip mask every day? Physical exfoliants seem to be too rough and at the same time far less effective.\n\nMy other mainstays are Vitamin E stick, Nivea Moisture Pure Color, Shiseido Water Lip, and the Laneige lip mask. CNP Laboratory Propolis Lipcerin seems to make my lips burn, I only used it twice so it might be a coincidence but if I’m allergic to something then something in that would be my first guess.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that anything with a significant quantity of bees wax makes everything 10x worse",

I’ve noticed it got really bad after I stopped taking birth control pills and switched to an implant so I don’t know if that has anything to do with it. I’ve always had acne prone skin and ever since I turned 19 I noticed that if I got a pimple it would leave a dark mark (regardless of if I touched it or not) And I’ll have pimples that will never ever go away and will just stay as a bump\n\nWould a facial help? What else would help to get rid of dark spots left by pimples?? Or would it just be a waste of time? I have pretty sensitive skin that is oily on my forehead and nose but dry on the lower half of my face. What else would you suggest?

Let's start simple, I am 21F, scandinavian, sensitive and insanely dry skin. I recently added Azelaic acid 15% into my skincare routine and it makes me super itchy but if I though it out my skin is so much less red in the morning, like the results are instant.\n\nMy skincare routine goes like this.\n\nMorning:\nWash face with water.\nLa roche-posay SPF 50 (the fatter one with a pump)\n\nEvening:\nBeauty of joesun oil makeup remover. \nLa roche-posay toleriane micellar cleanser.\nThe ordinary hyaluronic acid.\nAzelaic acid 15% over the entire face except for eyes and lips.\nETUDE soon jung 2x barrier cream.\nLipbalm and eyelash serum.\n\nIs any of these clashing? Is the itching normal, it goes away after like 30 mins ish. Should I tough it out and it'll go away or is it damaging my skin? My acne is also getting worse but I heard that azelaic acid can cause purging. Any advice is helpful! Thanks ❤️",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",

Hello, my wife and i both white female, 24 and 26, adopted my twin 2yr old cousins this year. They are mixed race and both have very curly hair, my son has soft, smooth curls, they like just bounce back when you brush them out. His sister has very kinky curls, they get very knotted when shes done playing for the day. Her hair also seems to like deflect water, in bath/shower its like we have to keep getting her head wet cause it seems to dry really fast. We use the same products for their hair as it has helped get my daughters to become softer and not as dry/rough. Normal routine is we use the Mielle leave-in conditioner on non shower days as directions say on the bottle. In the shower/bath we have used multiple different products from baby shampoo when they were little to the garnier fructis curl nourish shampoo/conditioner. After that she gets her hooded towel on and we get her ready for bed, its like her hair just dries itself really fast as we are getting her jammies on. We just want to make sure we are keeping her hair healthy and not cause any damage to it in the long run. They both use silk pillow cases as we were told my friends and coworkers that would also help alot as she isnt old enough to understand to keep a bonnet on.",
