      "content": "Notes from a skin cosmetologist.\n\nIndian skin tans easily, marks easily, and holds onto pigmentation longer. Ik, it's a little sad. Mostly because our melanin response is very active (thanks to sun + heat + inflammation).\n\nIf you're dealing with tanning, dark spots, or acne marks, here are ingredients that actually work, and (istg this is more important) how they work:\n\n1. Mulberry Extract\nA gentle tyrosinase inhibitor. What this does is it slows the enzyme that makes excess pigment. Good for people who want brightening without irritation.\n\n2. Niacinamide\nDoesn’t lighten melanin!\nInstead, it reduces melanosome transfer, which means less pigment gets passed to the surface layers.\nAmazing for acne marks, PIH\n\n3. Alpha Arbutin\nA stable brightening ingredient that also inhibits tyrosinase, but gradually\nGreat for uneven tone without harshness.\n\n4. Licorice Extract\nContains glabridin + liquiritin. Magical as they are, both work as tyrosinase suppressors + anti-inflammatory... Licorice is giving 😌\nSo it treats dark spots and the inflammation causing them.\n\n5. Centella (Cica)\nMy favourite when it comes to formulating! Not a brightener by itself, but reduces inflammation + oxidative stress, which are major triggers for pigmentation.\n\nBiggest rule for pigmentation :\nREDUCE INFLAMMATION FIRST.\nBrightening only works when the skin is calm.\n\nHope this helps!",

I still use the same gel and leave-in conditioner for both of these pics.\n\nDamaged my hair by tying it back in a low ponytail and wearing a hat most days for the last couple years, and only doing the full curl routine like twice a week. I also had some significant shedding last year so I got on finasteride and minoxidil earlier this year which is why I think I'm seeing more short flyaways around my scalp than normal. Hair is also way more matte than it used to be.\n\nOutside of just not pulling my hair back as much and as tight by using silk scrunchies instead of tight hair ties, any recommendations for some tweaks to my routine?\n\nRoutine:\n\n* Wash every 6-7 days with Ouidad Cleansing Oil Shampoo.\n   * Every three washes I will instead use Malibu C shampoo with a dab of aussie miracle curls shampoo to cleanse the hardwater and silicons.\n* Condition with Cantu Argan Oil Leave-In Conditioning repair cream and then rinse.\n* 1.5 pumps of Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-In Conditioner.\n* Around 4 pumps of Ouidad Climate Control Gel - I have to use a lot to keep the frizz in check.\n* Scrunch out some of the moisture with a microfiber towel.\n* Diffuse on low heat with Dyson diffuser for about 15-20 minutes to about 70-80% dry.\n* Around 3 hours later carefully crunch out cast with Olaplex Bonding Oil or some Morraconoil Argan Oil (mostly just cup my ends and press it against scalp for a second or two)\n* On days that I want a quicker routine for work if I don't have meetings or presentations, I just swap the gel for some Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream and don't worry about diffusing. Gets me like 70% of the results as above, but with less active time.\n* As needed I deep condition with Ouidad Moisture Lock Mask.\n\nI use a silk pillowcase and I have tried pineappling at night and have even tried a silk beanie, but I have never been able to really refresh my curls to the point I think they look acceptable. One of the reasons I tied it back so much. My hair is fine/medium fine with low density.",

      "content": "Happy holidays, all! I am a wavy girl desperately in need of advice. I’ve been wearing my hair curly since my early 20s, but I am now 4 months pregnant and trying to grow my hair out. At this new length, my hair is not responding to my usual routines (and maybe the hormones are playing a part). I am trying hard to take care of myself as my body changes, so it’s important to me to find a better routine. \n\nFor reference, my hair has a strong wave; it’s straight at the top but wavy / curly towards the bottom with some ringlets. It’s fine but thick and low porosity. The first two pics are my hair post diffuser. It was looking stringy, so I switched to a blow drying cap - results are the next three pics. In the last pic I tried brushing it and didn’t like those results either. Here is what I tried today:\n\nClarifying shampoo with scalp massager, moisturizing shampoo with scalp massager, moisturizing conditioner, deep conditioner. While my hair was still soaking wet I put in Davine’s curl cream, then Cake curly hair mousse, then some Eco flax / olive oil gel. I scrunched it with a microfiber towel a few times and then plopped for 30 minutes. After that I sprayed in some Marc Anthony “length and strength” heat protectant, then used the diffuser and blow dry cap. \n\nI have also tried the bowl method, then blow drying or air drying. I’ve used a hair curling headband with mixed results. I used to just use these products then let it air dry and refresh with water / leave in conditioner spray. \n\nPLEASE give me some advice. Do I need a need diffuser or dryer? New products? Should I just chop my hair off? Help! ",

      "content": "People always say *“Rooney must’ve never taken fin”* whenever his hair comes up, but honestly that explanation is kinda lazy and doesn’t line up with how hair loss meds work in real life.\n\nWayne Rooney reportedly started finasteride around 2009 ([https://www.theonlineclinic.co.uk/news/2009/05/20/RooneyToGoOnPropecia.aspx](https://www.theonlineclinic.co.uk/news/2009/05/20/RooneyToGoOnPropecia.aspx)).\n\nHe then had that famous hair transplant in 2011, followed by another transplant in 2013. Fast-forward, only 3 years later in 2016, his hair looked awful and looked almost completely bald. ([https://www.thesun.co.uk](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/1255974/wayne-rooneys-two-previous-hair-transplants-appear-to-have-flopped-as-he-prepares-for-euro-2016-with-a-threadbare-rug/))\n\nThese days he pretty clearly uses hair fibres to make it look fuller. If fin was this guaranteed “stop button,” none of that should’ve happened. But it did.\n\nA lot of people here like to say *“well he just didn’t take it consistently”*, but the uncomfortable truth is that fin (and even dut) only slow hair loss, they don’t stop it for everyone. Especially if you’ve got aggressive genetics, all they really do is buy you time. For some guys that’s 10–15 years. For others it’s like… 3–5 years and then the loss just keeps marching on.\n\nRooney started losing early and aggressively. Fin likely helped *slow things down*, but it clearly didn’t freeze his hair forever, even with multiple transplants backing it up. And meds didn't save his native hair from continuing to miniaturise.\n\nAnd it’s not just Rooney. There are plenty of normal, well-documented cases of guys who started early (NW2-ish), stayed on fin for 12 years, and still ended up heavily thinned or basically bald. Here’s one of those documented cases people like to ignore: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WxN5ocR6TU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WxN5ocR6TU)\n\nSo yeah, Rooney isn’t proof that fin “doesn’t work”, but he *is* proof that fin doesn’t work equally well for everyone, aggressive hair loss will often win eventually, and meds mostly delay the inevitable, not stop it.\n\nAnyone pretending otherwise is just coping or hasn’t been on this journey long enough yet on.",

When I scrunch it with gel or foam, it forms very defined waves that I don’t like. I prefer looser, more natural-looking waves like the ones in the first photo. I don’t even know if that’s possible with my hair type.\n\nI’d also like advice on how to treat my hair in general, because it only recently turned wavy and I feel very lost. I want to keep it long, btw I know it doesn’t look very healthy right now, but I don’t want to cut too much. Maybe I need a specific haircut to achieve the waves I want, but I honestly don’t know.\nAt the moment, I’m using John Frieda shampoo and conditioner, and a wave gel from Garnier (from my country),I'm always doing a different routine to see if anything changes but no.\nI’d also like to know the best way to dry my hair to get this type of waves, and how to sleep on it without ruining them.\n\nSorry if this is too much,I’m just REALLY lost.😭",

At first i thought ok maybe the cut just doesn’t suit my face or maybe i didnt specify enough. But i’ve gotten a haircut from the same lady in the past and she did really well, it was very flattering despite a few details i didnt like. \n\nWhat are my options?? I dont even know where to start in terms of styling &amp; i feel like my head just looks weird— flat top &amp; bottom heavy bc of how its cut. I made an appointment for a different salon to try and salvage it but i don’t know what they can actually do to salvage it? \n\nAny suggestions on how to fix the cut &amp; how to style it in the meantime would be appreciated— i have my birthday trip to europe in a week please help 😭😭😭😭",

She has naturally curly hair, but she’s very low-maintenance with it.\n\nRight now she only uses Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, brushes her curls when they’re dry (which makes them super frizzy), and her ends are really dry. Her hair also looks kind of flat on top, and she has some thinner spots around the crown.\n\nShe doesn’t like spending time on her hair and is very picky about textures and smells, she doesn't prefer mousse and anything sticky or heavily scented.\n\nWhat I’m thinking so far:\n\n\\-She definitely needs a conditioner\n\n\\-Probably a hair mask for moisture\n\n\\-Maybe one very easy, lightweight product to reduce frizz and define those curls \n\nMy questions:\n\nWhich dm products would you recommend for dry, frizzy curls that don’t require a full curl routine?\n\nAre there any lightweight, non-sticky, low-scent products that work for curls?\n\nDoes she need a specific brush or comb to avoid frizz?\n\nIs there a lazy method that improves curls without defining every single curl?\n\nI’m not trying to force her into the full Curly Girl Method, just something that makes her hair healthier, softer, and less frizzy with minimal effort.\n\nI really want her to feel more confident and care for herself as she struggels with her mental health a lot. I would love to see her feel a little bit prettier.\n\nThanks so much in advance! ✨",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

I don't really know what I'm doing so I had some questions, general advice is welcome too.\n1. How do I keep it even all around? What do I tell the barber? The back seems to stick out unless I cut it super short but I imagine I'll have to tough it out when growing it out.\n2. Anything else to consider? Ie how it works with face shape, would it even look good etc. \n\nRoutine: \nConditioner when I shower, shampoo only if I get dirty, ie at work, and for styling I wet my hair, use SheaMoisture curl smoothie and pat dry with towel just so it's not dripping.\n\n",
