      "content": "Notes from a skin cosmetologist.\n\nIndian skin tans easily, marks easily, and holds onto pigmentation longer. Ik, it's a little sad. Mostly because our melanin response is very active (thanks to sun + heat + inflammation).\n\nIf you're dealing with tanning, dark spots, or acne marks, here are ingredients that actually work, and (istg this is more important) how they work:\n\n1. Mulberry Extract\nA gentle tyrosinase inhibitor. What this does is it slows the enzyme that makes excess pigment. Good for people who want brightening without irritation.\n\n2. Niacinamide\nDoesn’t lighten melanin!\nInstead, it reduces melanosome transfer, which means less pigment gets passed to the surface layers.\nAmazing for acne marks, PIH\n\n3. Alpha Arbutin\nA stable brightening ingredient that also inhibits tyrosinase, but gradually\nGreat for uneven tone without harshness.\n\n4. Licorice Extract\nContains glabridin + liquiritin. Magical as they are, both work as tyrosinase suppressors + anti-inflammatory... Licorice is giving 😌\nSo it treats dark spots and the inflammation causing them.\n\n5. Centella (Cica)\nMy favourite when it comes to formulating! Not a brightener by itself, but reduces inflammation + oxidative stress, which are major triggers for pigmentation.\n\nBiggest rule for pigmentation :\nREDUCE INFLAMMATION FIRST.\nBrightening only works when the skin is calm.\n\nHope this helps!",

I still use the same gel and leave-in conditioner for both of these pics.\n\nDamaged my hair by tying it back in a low ponytail and wearing a hat most days for the last couple years, and only doing the full curl routine like twice a week. I also had some significant shedding last year so I got on finasteride and minoxidil earlier this year which is why I think I'm seeing more short flyaways around my scalp than normal. Hair is also way more matte than it used to be.\n\nOutside of just not pulling my hair back as much and as tight by using silk scrunchies instead of tight hair ties, any recommendations for some tweaks to my routine?\n\nRoutine:\n\n* Wash every 6-7 days with Ouidad Cleansing Oil Shampoo.\n   * Every three washes I will instead use Malibu C shampoo with a dab of aussie miracle curls shampoo to cleanse the hardwater and silicons.\n* Condition with Cantu Argan Oil Leave-In Conditioning repair cream and then rinse.\n* 1.5 pumps of Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-In Conditioner.\n* Around 4 pumps of Ouidad Climate Control Gel - I have to use a lot to keep the frizz in check.\n* Scrunch out some of the moisture with a microfiber towel.\n* Diffuse on low heat with Dyson diffuser for about 15-20 minutes to about 70-80% dry.\n* Around 3 hours later carefully crunch out cast with Olaplex Bonding Oil or some Morraconoil Argan Oil (mostly just cup my ends and press it against scalp for a second or two)\n* On days that I want a quicker routine for work if I don't have meetings or presentations, I just swap the gel for some Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream and don't worry about diffusing. Gets me like 70% of the results as above, but with less active time.\n* As needed I deep condition with Ouidad Moisture Lock Mask.\n\nI use a silk pillowcase and I have tried pineappling at night and have even tried a silk beanie, but I have never been able to really refresh my curls to the point I think they look acceptable. One of the reasons I tied it back so much. My hair is fine/medium fine with low density.",

      "content": "Happy holidays, all! I am a wavy girl desperately in need of advice. I’ve been wearing my hair curly since my early 20s, but I am now 4 months pregnant and trying to grow my hair out. At this new length, my hair is not responding to my usual routines (and maybe the hormones are playing a part). I am trying hard to take care of myself as my body changes, so it’s important to me to find a better routine. \n\nFor reference, my hair has a strong wave; it’s straight at the top but wavy / curly towards the bottom with some ringlets. It’s fine but thick and low porosity. The first two pics are my hair post diffuser. It was looking stringy, so I switched to a blow drying cap - results are the next three pics. In the last pic I tried brushing it and didn’t like those results either. Here is what I tried today:\n\nClarifying shampoo with scalp massager, moisturizing shampoo with scalp massager, moisturizing conditioner, deep conditioner. While my hair was still soaking wet I put in Davine’s curl cream, then Cake curly hair mousse, then some Eco flax / olive oil gel. I scrunched it with a microfiber towel a few times and then plopped for 30 minutes. After that I sprayed in some Marc Anthony “length and strength” heat protectant, then used the diffuser and blow dry cap. \n\nI have also tried the bowl method, then blow drying or air drying. I’ve used a hair curling headband with mixed results. I used to just use these products then let it air dry and refresh with water / leave in conditioner spray. \n\nPLEASE give me some advice. Do I need a need diffuser or dryer? New products? Should I just chop my hair off? Help! ",

Ive also tried 0.1% retinoid three separate occasions (using it for 2+ months daily in the past). Despite being consistent with cleanser, retinoid, and moisturizer, I’ve had no luck with clearing my skin. I have also worn SPF daily, though i find that I break out from it.\n\nRecently, I switched my routine to only include the following:\n\n1. Cerave hydrating facial cleanser\n2. Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%\n3. Purito panthenol moisturizer \n\nAfter using the niacinamide + zinc and/or panthenol for less than a week, i noticed that i now have pitted scars. \n\nIs it common to get pitted, indented scars from niacinamide, zinc, or panthenol?\n\nHow do I avoid more pitted scars?\n\nHow do I go about treating the current scars/skin in general?\n\ni understand that this is likely a 12 month+ process so no necessarily looking for quick fixes.\n\nAny suggestions / advice / feedback would be appreciated! Ive attached two pics - one with flash and one without. Thank you.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

I started taking skincare seriously in my mid-20s, and the difference now is very noticeable.\n\nUsing a simple routine with an anti-aging serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen has helped keep my skin smoother, more hydrated, and way more even in tone. It is less about fixing wrinkles and more about preventing damage before it becomes permanent.\n\nIngredients like niacinamide, peptides, ceramides, snail mucin, and hyaluronic acid focus on barrier repair and collagen support. When your barrier is healthy, your skin automatically looks younger and brighter.\n\nThe biggest change I noticed was texture. My skin feels bouncier and less dull, even when I am tired or stressed. Consistency matters more than using ten different products.\n\nIf you are in your 20s and think anti-aging skincare is not for you yet, trust me, future you will be very thankful you started early.\n\nCurious to know, when did you all start using anti-aging products and what made you begin?",

Maybe I need a specific haircut to achieve the waves I want, but I honestly don’t know.\nAt the moment, I’m using John Frieda shampoo and conditioner, and a wave gel from Garnier (from my country),I'm always doing a different routine to see if anything changes but no.\nI’d also like to know the best way to dry my hair to get this type of waves, and how to sleep on it without ruining them.\n\nSorry if this is too much,I’m just REALLY lost.😭",

By hair down, I mean no protective style or bonnet on. Is there a sleeping position, or a specific pillowcase? Would I have to prep my hair in a certain way? Or is it even possible to sleep with my hair down without waking up to a frizzball? And prevent breakage or damage? \n\n  \nRoutine: Foundation of Beauty curly shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in with finger-curling. Air-dry. Refresh is just putting some water in and a prayer.
