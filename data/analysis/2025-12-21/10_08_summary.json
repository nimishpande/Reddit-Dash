      "content": "I feel like people still think anti-aging skincare is only for people in their 40s or 50s, but honestly starting early has been one of the best decisions for my skin. I started taking skincare seriously in my mid-20s, and the difference now is very noticeable.\n\nUsing a simple routine with an anti-aging serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen has helped keep my skin smoother, more hydrated, and way more even in tone. It is less about fixing wrinkles and more about preventing damage before it becomes permanent.\n\nIngredients like niacinamide, peptides, ceramides, snail mucin, and hyaluronic acid focus on barrier repair and collagen support. When your barrier is healthy, your skin automatically looks younger and brighter.\n\nThe biggest change I noticed was texture. My skin feels bouncier and less dull, even when I am tired or stressed. Consistency matters more than using ten different products.\n\nIf you are in your 20s and think anti-aging skincare is not for you yet, trust me, future you will be very thankful you started early.\n\nCurious to know, when did you all start using anti-aging products and what made you begin?",

I still use the same gel and leave-in conditioner for both of these pics.\n\nDamaged my hair by tying it back in a low ponytail and wearing a hat most days for the last couple years, and only doing the full curl routine like twice a week. I also had some significant shedding last year so I got on finasteride and minoxidil earlier this year which is why I think I'm seeing more short flyaways around my scalp than normal. Hair is also way more matte than it used to be.\n\nOutside of just not pulling my hair back as much and as tight by using silk scrunchies instead of tight hair ties, any recommendations for some tweaks to my routine?\n\nRoutine:\n\n* Wash every 6-7 days with Ouidad Cleansing Oil Shampoo.\n   * Every three washes I will instead use Malibu C shampoo with a dab of aussie miracle curls shampoo to cleanse the hardwater and silicons.\n* Condition with Cantu Argan Oil Leave-In Conditioning repair cream and then rinse.\n* 1.5 pumps of Ouidad Moisture Lock Leave-In Conditioner.\n* Around 4 pumps of Ouidad Climate Control Gel - I have to use a lot to keep the frizz in check.\n* Scrunch out some of the moisture with a microfiber towel.\n* Diffuse on low heat with Dyson diffuser for about 15-20 minutes to about 70-80% dry.\n* Around 3 hours later carefully crunch out cast with Olaplex Bonding Oil or some Morraconoil Argan Oil (mostly just cup my ends and press it against scalp for a second or two)\n* On days that I want a quicker routine for work if I don't have meetings or presentations, I just swap the gel for some Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream and don't worry about diffusing. Gets me like 70% of the results as above, but with less active time.\n* As needed I deep condition with Ouidad Moisture Lock Mask.\n\nI use a silk pillowcase and I have tried pineappling at night and have even tried a silk beanie, but I have never been able to really refresh my curls to the point I think they look acceptable. One of the reasons I tied it back so much. My hair is fine/medium fine with low density.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

My mom doesn’t like them either, even though many people tell me they look great. I just can’t stand them short. I usually end up wearing a loose high ponytail with a clip at the elastic to lift my curls (not a tight ponytail).\n\nI’ve been straightening my hair for 2–3 years after a keratin treatment. I didn’t trim much + undiagnosed trichotillomania - I guess- (I used to play with my split ends for hours), which caused uneven length. My hair is now the longest it’s ever been, and I want to avoid past mistakes.\n\nI noticed some breakage this week (probably from not drying it properly).\n\nMy question: (ik it’s not recommended BUT) is it possible to get healthy curls back (later) without cutting my hair if I straighten it once a week (medium heat, heat protection), trim regularly, and take good care of it for the next year/year and a half until it’s longer?\n\n# Current routine if someone’s interested (not perfect ik):\n\nGarnier Papaya shampoo + mask/leave-in\n\nCurl gel (professional brand)\n\nDiffuse + some air drying because I don’t take my time\n\nDetangle in the shower\n\nCurly brush for styling\n\nMicrofiber towel\n\nStyle on dripping wet hair\n\nSleeping on a \"satin\" bonnet\n\nI don’t have a refresh routine\n\n(I used ai to correct my text)\n\n(Some pictures of my hair)",

      "content": "Happy holidays, all! I am a wavy girl desperately in need of advice. I’ve been wearing my hair curly since my early 20s, but I am now 4 months pregnant and trying to grow my hair out. At this new length, my hair is not responding to my usual routines (and maybe the hormones are playing a part). I am trying hard to take care of myself as my body changes, so it’s important to me to find a better routine. \n\nFor reference, my hair has a strong wave; it’s straight at the top but wavy / curly towards the bottom with some ringlets. It’s fine but thick and low porosity. The first two pics are my hair post diffuser. It was looking stringy, so I switched to a blow drying cap - results are the next three pics. In the last pic I tried brushing it and didn’t like those results either. Here is what I tried today:\n\nClarifying shampoo with scalp massager, moisturizing shampoo with scalp massager, moisturizing conditioner, deep conditioner. While my hair was still soaking wet I put in Davine’s curl cream, then Cake curly hair mousse, then some Eco flax / olive oil gel. I scrunched it with a microfiber towel a few times and then plopped for 30 minutes. After that I sprayed in some Marc Anthony “length and strength” heat protectant, then used the diffuser and blow dry cap. \n\nI have also tried the bowl method, then blow drying or air drying. I’ve used a hair curling headband with mixed results. I used to just use these products then let it air dry and refresh with water / leave in conditioner spray. \n\nPLEASE give me some advice. Do I need a need diffuser or dryer? New products? Should I just chop my hair off? Help! ",

I had zero dandruff because it has no propylene glycol, but I started losing all my gains and went back to Kirkland a month ago, and sold my soul to finastride pills after avoiding all these years. Dandruff came back real fast, hoping gains will too. Any advice on how to lose the dandruffs without switching to foam? (which I feel gives worse results with me)",
