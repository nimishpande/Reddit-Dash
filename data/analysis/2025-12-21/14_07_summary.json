      "content": "I feel like people still think anti-aging skincare is only for people in their 40s or 50s, but honestly starting early has been one of the best decisions for my skin. I started taking skincare seriously in my mid-20s, and the difference now is very noticeable.\n\nUsing a simple routine with an anti-aging serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen has helped keep my skin smoother, more hydrated, and way more even in tone. It is less about fixing wrinkles and more about preventing damage before it becomes permanent.\n\nIngredients like niacinamide, peptides, ceramides, snail mucin, and hyaluronic acid focus on barrier repair and collagen support. When your barrier is healthy, your skin automatically looks younger and brighter.\n\nThe biggest change I noticed was texture. My skin feels bouncier and less dull, even when I am tired or stressed. Consistency matters more than using ten different products.\n\nIf you are in your 20s and think anti-aging skincare is not for you yet, trust me, future you will be very thankful you started early.\n\nCurious to know, when did you all start using anti-aging products and what made you begin?",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Any advice is welcome to be honest.\n\nI have seen lots of people recommend the z sea neck cream and I am slightly wary about spending money on something without seeing the results. I've also heard I should gua sha, not only to make my face less puffy but also the blood flow (?) would fix the lines? Should i invest in a gua sha anyways? Again, any advice helps, even if it's pillows to help my sleep posture haha.\n\n(PS: please, don't tell me to lose weight like my doctor and dermatologist have told me. I have and it did nothing.)\n\n(PSPS: sorry if this necessarily \"routine help\", I didn't know which tag would fit best.)\n",

I have eczema and I’ve also had issues with mild psoriasis, I still have tiny scabs all over my scalp and the itching is mainly around those areas but also just my whole scalp.\n\n\nI was at a hairdresser recently and told her about my scalp problems and she gave me a specific shampoo with some oil or something that was supposed to help psoriasis. It gave me an allergic reaction and my scalp is now a gazillion times worse…\n\n\nI use the barnängen volume shampoo + their dandruff shampoo and it has made my scalp a little better, but I’ve been considering trying a clarifying shampoo to see if that might help because I do think I also have a lot of buildup. Does anyone have any recommendations on clarifying shampoos that work on a sensitive and psoriasis/eczema prone scalp? :(",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
