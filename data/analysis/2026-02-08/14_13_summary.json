I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

      "content": "So I’m seeing a lot of people in this subreddit recommending and using Honasa-owned brand sunscreens (Mamaearth / Derma Co / Aqualogica / Dr. Sheth / Dot &amp; key  etc.) without knowing the full picture.\n\n\nRecent independent tests have raised serious concerns about whether many of these sunscreens actually deliver the SPF protection they claim. In several cases, the protection was found to be much lower than what’s written on the label.\nHonestly, a lot of these products work more like moisturizers with sunscreen-like texture, not real sun protection.\n\nI know some people will say:\n\n“But I love the texture”\n\n“It suits my skin”\n\n“I don’t tan when I use it”\n\n\nBut liking the feel ≠ getting actual UV protection.\nWith summer coming and harsh sun exposure, low or unreliable SPF can still lead to tanning, pigmentation, and long-term damage.\n\nI’m saying this from personal experience too.\nA few months ago, I also used some Honasa sunscreens because influencers hyped them so much. Now I’m stuck trying to reverse my tan , which is way harder than preventing it in the first place.\n\n\nThis isn’t brand hate, just a warning.\nPlease don’t blindly trust influencer marketing and don’t waste your money on sunscreens that may not protect you properly. Invest in tested, reliable sunscreens, especially if you’re outdoors a lot.\n\nLearn from my mistake. Skin damage is expensive and slow to fix.",

      "content": "I’m hoping this sub can help shed some light on what this skin issue is. I’ve had this for probably about 8 years now - it quite literally seemed to start overnight, my skin had always been pretty clear before that. The only trigger I can think of is I started taking probiotics for something else (for a short period and never touched them since). \n\nI get these red bumps only on my chin and around my mouth, nowhere else. They often don’t come to a head but are really itchy under the skin, last for ages and leave red marks for a while. It also kind of looks a bit scaly with very small bumps on one side - I’ve tried to get a photo but it’s not showing up very well. It’s not at its absolute worst right now but . \n\nI am at my wits end. I have tried pretty much everything under the sun, all of which either didn’t work or made things worse, including:\n\n* Retinol and tretinoin\n* Benzoyl peroxide\n* Antibiotic gel\n* Lactic acid \n* Salicylic acid\n* Azelaic acid - did have some success with this but then I went up a % and now my skin won’t tolerate it!\n* Different contraceptive pills\n* Spironolactone\n* Plus probably many other things over the years! \n\nI’ve always thought it was acne related to hormonal imbalance as it’s isolated to my chin only, though breakouts are unrelated to my cycle. I’ve seen a dermatologist privately (I’m in the UK so wasn’t cheap) who also said it was acne, but a lot of the treatments I’ve ever been prescribed or used for acne always aggravate it further. \n\nI eat a largely whole food diet with limited sugar and dairy. I’ve tried changing my pillowcase every night, I drink plenty of water, rarely wear make up, all the things that are suggested, I’ve tried. \n\nI’m now starting to think it’s not acne and possibly perioral dermatitis or something else. I’ve stated zero therapy this week and have begun eliminating caffeine and gluten to see if that helps. I’m also planning on stripping back my skincare to natural, simple products when I do begin using them again after a few weeks of zero therapy. \n\nAny advice from this subreddit would be so enormously helpful, I’m at the end of my tether 😩",

Most curlyheads rave on about getting a poofy mess in the morning after waking up when mines the complete opposite, I wake up with thin pin straight hair and if I don’t add water or some type of leave in conditioner, it will be stuck straight forever. Is my hair some type of hybrid???\n\nMy routine:\n\nI shampoo and condition once a week using the based shampoo and conditioner. Then I style with either the As I am bond leave-in or the based leave in followed by the based curl creme and gel. I usually like to switch it up and use different products such as multicultural curls or pillow soft curls from miss jessies or something like the bee girl gel from doux.\n\nI also co-wash once a week using the based conditioner and following it with the same routine above.\n\nFor every product I usually scrunch it in or brush style, but if I’m feeling fancy I’ll finger coil(this takes WAY too much time though).\n\nTo protect my hair while I sleep, I use a silk bonnet but sometimes I get lazy and just sleep without it, I don’t think this really matters because I also use a silk pillowcase.\n\nFor drying, I diffuse my hair until it’s a complete gel cast and I scrunch it out with this generic jojoba oil from my local dollar store. Sometimes if I’m in a rush, I just diffuse until its at least 50% dry and just it air dry for the rest of the time(still using oil after tho).",

Lanolin. Which is the main ingredient in a lot of Lanolips products. You just get it at Walmart even! In the baby area &amp; it’s labeled as nipple cream so don’t let that freak you out lol. It’s so smooth, moisturizing, &amp; actually cures. I use it on dry spots anywhere, my elbows, my eyelashes, for everything! It’s a MIRACLE! And it’s not expensive either. It lasts forever I’ve had mine for months &amp; use it everyday. The tube is big too when you use it as a lip product \n\nI didn’t wanna gatekeep this secret so please get some &amp; update me if you want even!! This is what it looks like &amp; this is what it makes your lips look like. Very shiny &amp; like you just used lanolips. It’s the same nice texture \n\nI hope this can at least help any of the girlies!! I’m trying! It really does make a difference!!!!",

Dermat  suggested this one shampoo.He said dandruff feels like the main issue and lets get bloodwork done if this doesnt resolve the problem.I feel after two washes this shampoo has increased my hairfall.This shampoo first gives a colling effect and then a irritation/burning sensation.Might be because of my sensitive scalp.Although i cannot say with surity as the past two weeks i have been able to wash my hair at far gaps and this increases the hairfall during shampoo as ive heard.\n\nso please help me. i need help regarding two things.\n\n1. Are the ingredients of this shampoo that bad? As per my basic research they arent that harmful. They are a bit medical and thats the reason behind them smelling a particular way too.\n\n2. Knowing stress and diet are some major reasons, But if you can please suggest some shampoo/oil which has soothed your dandruff or hairfall previously.\n\nany advice would be of great help.🤍",

I skip the sunscreen at nighttime. I also use benzoyl peroxide for spot treatment.\n\nShould I change these products and/or add to this routine?\n\nPS I’m really hoping to get some advice on this community-based group because, other than going to a dermatologist which I might still do, I don’t know where else I can get personal advice like this.

Thank you all for any responses!\n\nRoutine:\n\n1) shampoo and condition with Aveda curly hair line\n2) sometimes instead of conditioner it's a 10 keratin leave in conditioner\n3) boucleme curl defining gel scrunched in\n4) air dry and scrunch at intervals\n5) refresh as needed in the morning by wetting the hair only as much as I need to get a.vrush through comfortably (keeping roots dry) and addi g a tiny bit of extra gel if necessary.
