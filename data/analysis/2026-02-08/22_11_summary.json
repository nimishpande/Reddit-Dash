      "content": "Hi all! Just posting a victory really. Yes I still bleach and dye my hair. As much as I love my curls, I love changing colours more. I’ve learnt how to do this without (completely) ruining my hair and I’m proud of myself for it. \n\nWhile my routine works, I would love some advice as I do wash my hair 3-4x a week, and I’d like to cut back on my wash days. I just feel my hair gets too greasy if I don’t. \n\nI usually wash twice a week with a clarifying shampoo, then a colour and/or curl protect shampoo. Any other wash day I just use my curl protect shampoo. Sometimes that’s Aussie, sometimes it’s the Loreal Elvive “Extraordinary oil”. The latter smells amazing!\n\nAfter washing these out, I use L’Oréal Elvive dream lengths or the extraordinary oil conditioner, sometimes I use both. I’ve never had my hair feel so nourished apart from this shampoo! I might also use a Garnier Hair Food mask if I’m gonna be in the shower for a long time. The cocoa butter “curl-restoring” is my fave.\n\nTo dry, I leave my hair soaking wet, section so that there’s a triangle at the front, and clip that up. I use one of those pronged curl brushes to brush through Umberto Giannini’s curl activating mousse, then massage that in, then use a tshirt to scrunch my hair. Once I’m happy with how my hair looks scrunched, I use Umberto Giannini’s Curl Jelly/scrunching jelly (pretty sure it’s the same thing as the normal one but I use the vanilla gelato scented one), then I diffuse my hair on high until bone dry. \n\nRepeat with the triangle section of the bangs.\n\nIf I want to save my curls for the next day, I sleep with my hair casted. I use Aussie’s “Work that Curl Oil” to break my cast. \n\nIt’s taken forever to find a method that works for my waves that I’m happy with! I’m still learning too, eg like cutting down my wash days, how to protect my wavy hair while sleeping (pineapple method is NOT working), and how to keep my curls fresh the next day. After I break my curl cast and sleep sometimes they lose 50% of their volume so I’m still learning how to fix that. However, I’m happy with my progress! ",

My face is overproducing so much oil that I look like a greaseball only hours after washing my face. I simply feel disgusting. Washing with even just water makes my face extremely tight now\n\nI’ve stripped back my routine as below - \n\nAM:\n\nRinse with room temp/lukewarm water\n\nApply Skinfix moisturizer\n\nPM:\n\nCleanse with LRP hydrating cleanser\n\nApply Skinfix moisturizer\n\nI stopped shaving with my razor and switched to an electric as well to prevent any exfoliating of my skin.\n\nWhile this seems to be better my skin is still tight and I feel like I could be doing more to help speed the process. I know it takes time but what else would be recommend to help me heal my barrier quicker? Toner? Serum? I have to be careful as to not use products that are too occlusive as it causes me to breakout from the ungodly amount of oil I am producing through the day/while sleeping.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated",

(I of course shower regularly loll I just don’t wash my face in between and I occasionally just use a rose water face wipe.. don’t come for me lol)\n\nI have lupus so sensitive skin.

I don’t need super heavy repair — I mostly want to keep my skin regularly moisturized so it stays comfortable and calm.\nIdeally, I’d love something that is vegan and cruelty-free, but that’s not a strict requirement if the product is really good.\n\nMy biggest issue: I absolutely hate the feeling of lotion sitting on my skin. I’m looking for something that absorbs very fast, is not greasy at all, and leaves no residue — basically that “is it even there?” feeling (if that’s even possible 😅).\nIf you have any recommendations for lightweight, fast-absorbing body lotions, I’d really appreciate it.

Then said it would look good with the color of the singer Paramore. I was like are you sure x2 that we can achieve that color? I didn’t think my hair was light enough for vivid colors. She reassured me yes and showed me a picture so I agreed to it.\n\nI noticed that she missed bleaching a spot right on the middle top of my forehead, where I part my bangs and let her know. She said she hopes the hair color “hides that spot.” She also accidentally bleached a piece that was supposed to be black, and she dyed it black but I asked her if the black was uneven on both sides and she said no.\n\nAfter she dyed what I expected to be a nice orange color, with a demi hair dye, and the black layer underneath, we realized I had hot roots. I also pointed out I could still see the spot she missed on top, and pointed out that the black was higher up on one side of my face than the other. So I asked her to even out the black. She seemed irritated but got some more black but she didn’t leave it on more than 2 mins so the black didn’t grab on. She also decided to add permanent hair dye where the spot she missed was in the middle part. After she told me earlier she was using Demi because my goal down the road it to go blonde. \n\nWell the final result is a rusty dark brown reddish color and I was shook. She wouldn’t let me look until the end after drying it and I told her this didn’t look like the picture and that I wasn’t happy with it. That this isn’t what I thought it would look like and if I knew it was gonna be a reddish rusty brown, I would have just gone with a medium brown still.\n\nShe made me pay, argued with me, gaslighted me and told me to call them on Monday to talk to the manager, that the manager would be the one to look at it or fix it but that I would have to pay for the adjustments.\n\nAt this point I’m at home and mortified to leave my house looking like this, I work on Monday and I know if I try to fix it they won’t fix it for me. I honestly would rather have the refund as I don’t have time to go back to the salon until next weekend. \n\nI don’t know if a chargeback would work or if they will even give me a refund or be able to fix it. \n\n\nAdvice on how to handle?

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

After the styling it’s all fine, but once I touch them my hair becomes all frizzy.\n\nLike, I’ve recently seen a video of a guy who passes his hand in his hair and they go back to how they were. If I try to do that my curls will just fall apart. (I don’t know if it makes sense, English isn’t my first language).\n\nI’m a boy and I have short hair.\n\nRoutine:\n\nshampoo (Garnier), conditioner (Garnier) while under the shower, then when I get out of the shower I get my shirt and hoodie on without drying my hair, then I use a defining cream, after that I put on a defining mousse.\n\nI then use a hairdryer at minimum to dry them and they’ll become “crunchy”: they’ll look wet and it almost looks like I have put on gel (they will be almost hard to touch). After that I let them dry at air for some time (usually 20 ish minutes because that’s the time I need to get to work, if I’m preparing to hang out I’ll wash my hair in advance and let them dry at air even for an hour or two), and after they have dried I do the scrunch.\n\nI don’t have any pictures of my curls right now, I will take one tomorrow in the morning before going to work (if I don’t forget). I will add the only one I have where you can see something so you can get an idea of my hair. (EDIT: it’s in the comment as I forgot to attach it when I published the post)\n\nAlso, if it can be useful I’ll also take a picture of the product I use. (The one I use aren’t the best, but it’s what I can currently afford.)\n\nWhat can I do to prevent my hair getting frizzy so easily?",

I only recently stopped straightening and started styling it wavy/curly (only been in the game for a week and I’ve never tried styling wavy hair before).\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n• Shampoo &amp; conditioner (both curl crush, hairlust)\n\n• Leave-in conditioner (curl crush, hairlust)\n\n• Mousse (curl crush, hairlust)\n\n• Gel (curl crush, hairlust)\n\n• Scrunch on soaking wet hair\n\n• Diffuse for a bit, then air-dry\n\nI REALLY try not to touch it after I’ve scrunched but DAMN I find it hard!!!!)\n\nI don’t brush it once it’s dry. \n\nWhat I’m struggling with:\n\n• Inconsistent wave pattern\n\n• Waves falling flat in the lengths\n\n• Not sure if I’m using too much or too little product\n\n• Unsure of my hair type (thinking somewhere around 2A–2B, but not confident)\n\nMy goal:\n\nDefined, soft waves with less frizz and better hold — without weighing my hair down.\n\nAny tips for beginners, routine tweaks, or insight into what my hair might need would be greatly appreciated. And also - do you believe I will get more defined waves in time? \n\nThanks in advance 🤍",

      "content": "I had a whole mental breakdown in 2020 during quarantine and went complete buzz cut. yeah it looked good etc. but that's not the point. as it grew back out I kept the sides short. it was like that for years until my family started telling me \"your brother's wedding is in a year you should grow your hair back out\" and I realized I'm not about to wear a wig to his wedding so it's basically gonna grow back out. I never ended up going (money) but continued to grow it back out. I was using argan oil on the roots after washing and conditioning to help. At one point ordered Spoiled Child so it can grow faster. Eventually getting into the awkward phase, I used smaller curlers to keep them stay tame. If I didn't use curlers ...well ....I'd have a frizzy head. The strip down the middle of my head is still curly. the sides....not so much. I'd have 2C hair on bad days and 3A hair on good days. But the sides? A constant \"tucked behind the ear and stuck\" look. I want my curls back! I feel like if I'm not artificially curling the hair on the sides, they're not gonna curl anymore. It's not straight hair just....goes out into a weird arch around my ears 😐\n\nRoutine for reference: I've been mostly using OGX shampoo and conditioner and Shea Moisture curl cream afterwards with Shea Moisture frizz serum as well. I'm down to using Tresemme shampoo and conditioner plus Cantu curl cream cuz I can't afford any decent product right now. Back when I was working in 2022-2023 I would use Nexxus. That's so far been my favorite brand. I don't wear a bonnet to bed. I hate things touching my neck, forehead, and ears (got a bit of the 'tism) and I don't have a silk/satin pillow. I've tried the cotton T-shirt method to dry overnight and it still doesn't stick.\n\nMy question is, did I mess up by continuing a buzz cut on the sides and letting the rest of my hair grow normally after a full buzz cut? Did that, by any chance, have an effect on how curly my hair is going to grow back out? If so, what can I do to get it back? My hair is now layered from ear to shoulder length. Somewhere between short and medium hair. I would post pics but I want to stay private. ",

My skin tends to dry out very quickly, so hydration and barrier protection are my main priorities. That said, I do occasionally experience small breakouts, specifically tiny pustules that develop and pop quickly, usually on my nose bridge or forehead. I’m hoping to incorporate something into my routine to help with these breakouts but I’m not quite sure what would work best.\n\n**My current routine is as follows:**\n\n**AM**\n\n1. Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n2. Naturie Skin Conditioner\n3. CeraVe Vitamin C Serum\n4. Ulta Chill Out Under Eye Balm\n5. La Roche-Posay Triple Repair Moisturizer mixed with Hero Green Correcting Cream (OG formula)\n6. Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n1. DHC Cleansing Oil\n2. Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n3. Naturie Skin Conditioner\n4. CeraVe Retinol Serum\n5. Ulta Chill Out Under Eye Balm\n6. La Roche-Posay Triple Repair Moisturizer\n\nI’ve considered adding a salicylic acid serum in the evening, but I’m unsure since it is typically geared toward more acne-prone skin.

I’ve decided I want to simplify my routine down to just two steps.\n\nMy current routine is: face wash, toner, serum, moisturizer. But I’m tired of leaving the house with a red face or skipping my routine entirely because of how much energy it takes. I think I’d be fine with just a face wash and a moisturizer, so unless there’s a strong reason why I shouldn’t do that, that’s what I plan to stick with.\n\nI’m pretty new to skincare and not entirely sure which products or brands to use that aren’t extremely high-end or expensive. I know I want a gentle cleansing face wash and a facial moisturizer with SPF, since I live in a very sunny and hot area. \n\nI want to avoid cheap or generic store brand face washes because they tend to dry my skin out. Other than that, I’m open to any advice or drugstore product recommendations that work well together for a simple routine.",
