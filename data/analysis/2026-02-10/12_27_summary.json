I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

My wash days aren’t turning out great (frizzy, wonky curls) and then seemingly as soon as I leave my apartment they go limp and stringy. The first picture is from this afternoon after washing and styling last night. The second picture is from a while ago but is more how my hair used to look. \n\nMy hair is long, fine, medium density, and I think low porosity, so it’s easily weighed down. I’ve always struggled with hold but not usually to this extent. I live in Canada so I think the dry winter might be part of it, but it hasn’t been this bad in the past. \n\nCurrent routine:\n\nWash with Pantene volume shampoo\n\nCondition with a small amount of pattern detangling nectar or herbal essences nourishing detangling spray\n\nScrunch out excess water\n\nApply Harry’s gel in sections and brush style\n\nHover diffuse (don’t usually pixie diffuse as I find it gives me wonky curls)\n\nSilk scarf to sleep\n\nI recently changed gels because I felt like my usual got2b gel was drying out my hair in the winter, so I switched to Giovanni LA hold, which made my hair feel even drier and had pretty weak hold, so I switched to Harry’s which gives a good cast but once I scrunch it out it’s like I have no hold. \n\nI’ve also been experimenting with different conditioners since my hair has been staticky (so I assume dry?), but they all just seem to make my hair even more limp. \n\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated, I’m at my wit’s end and my straightener is beckoning to me.

Pineappling gives me flat roots and weird kinks at the ponytail line, silk scarves slide off my head within an hour of falling asleep (even the ones with ties, idk how), braids leave me with a texture that looks nothing like my actual curl pattern.\n\nI've been doing a loose gather at the crown into a satin bonnet and it's the first method that doesn't completely destroy my definition by morning, though I did have to try like four different bonnets before finding one that actually stays on my head. The one from kitsch has been good, double layered and doesn't slide around.\n\naaand this is my wash day routine for context: I cleanse with the kitsch rice water bar, condition with mielle pomegranate and honey, scrunch in aussie instant freeze while soaking wet, diffuse to maybe 80% dry then air dry the rest. Sleep with fully dry hair only, that's been key... wet or even damp hair in a bonnet is a frizz disaster waiting to happen. Morning refresh is just a light water mist and scrunching, sometimes a tiny bit more kinky curly gel if things are really flat.",

Does anyone have experience dealing with this kind of texture on this part of the face? I didn’t use to have it before, but harsh cleansers and exfoliants tend to break me out and make my skin red and dry. I also have a lot of redness around my nose most of the time, it’s been an issue for years ever since I entered puberty. (It Looks way worse irl, the picture doesn’t capture it well)  I’m honestly not sure whether it’s irritation or some kind of hyperpigmentation, but I assume and hope it’s the former. \n\nAny advice or suggestions are very much appreciated. Feel free to share similar experiences too if you want. Thanks in advance! ",

She was once like \"why did you cut your hair?\" This is putting pressure on me and I honestly don't think I could be with someone who prioritises physical features. Not saying she's like that but she puts a lot of emphasis on male grooming and hair being neat.\n\nAnother girl at work (27) commented about a guy who is balding and said she doesn't like that he cut his hair cause now he looks ugly and in my mind I was like \"He had no choice he is balding\".\n\nI hate how the younger generation just concentrates on things that are not super important like physical appearance and it just makes me feel even more insecure cause I'm balding myself.

Not sure it its the products, technique OR I just need to give it time for my waves to come back. \n\nContext \n\n\\- I’ve always had a wave pattern\n\n\\- I get highlights 3 times a year \n\n\\- I use K18 every 3/4 washes \n\n\\- for years I’ve NOT treated my hair like it’s curly, simply rough blow drying it after the shower and then putting it into a bun or curling it with a curling wand once a week\n\n\\- when I blow dry my hair, it goes hugeeee and poofy\n\n\\- I really look after my hair as much as possible, but think I’ve been working against my texture for so long \n\n\\- wear a satin bonnet every night \n\n\\- for years I’ve roughly blow dried my hair, but since letting it air dry this takes hours and hours and hours (6-7 hours it can take to fully dry)\n\nRoutine/ what I’ve been trying:\n\n1. On dripping wet hair, use a leave in conditioner\n\n2. Then rake through the JVC air dry cream and start scrunching \n\n3. John Frieda curl mousse. Taking and scrunching that through.\n\n4. Then sometimes use a bit of gel, sometimes don’t (I’m trying to figure out what works). I try and use the prayer method and then scrunch the ends a bit. \n\n5. Air dry. I don’t own a diffuser (yet).\n\nShampoo and conditioner I use is Redken all soft range and Dove intensive repair. I also clarify once a week. Don’t know if these are ‘wavy’ friendly, but I bought them because I thought my texture was just dryness. My hair is defo dry, but using moisturising products never seemed to help with the frizz or dry ends. \n\nI’m really new to this, so haven’t got a clue what hair type I have, or what products to use. Suppose it’ll be a bit of trial and error, but any advice at all would be amazing as I’m not sure what I should or shouldn’t be doing 🥲",

      "content": "I have malasezzia/fungal acne with very oily skin type , that even bare face requires blotting by tissues in the evening . No other moisturizer or serum suits my skin, to not further aggravate oiliness or to repair when skin barrier is irritated. Also it costs way less than the expensive, overrated moisturizer from formularx. So when i knew it's going to be discontinued ,i needed to stock up on this, cause my life literally depends on it. i guess this is the only affordable product with multiple ceramides &amp; 0 silicones &amp; 0 fragrances (ceramides in ingredients (Ceramide 1 &amp; Ceramide 2 &amp; Ceramide 3 &amp; Ceramide 4 &amp; Ceramide 6 ) ).\n\ni use tre &amp; azelaic acid , so i need ceramide-rich moisturizers to hydrate and repair the skin barrier to counteract the dryness, irritation, and peeling i.e often caused by Tre... I found  formula rx causing a excessively slick oily feel, minutes after application ,even though it quickly gets absorbed upon application &amp; it aggravates my fungal acne.\n\n also earth rhythm has way too many ceramides(Ceramide 1 &amp; Ceramide 2 &amp; Ceramide 3 &amp; Ceramide 4 &amp; Ceramide 6 ) than formularx(ceramide np) and you can feel the difference.. example when your skin is red &amp; burning due to excessive application of tre, formularx will burn wherever applied but earth rhythm will calm the barrier &amp; cool the skin &amp; heal the skin barrier...\n\nDisclaimer:- Earth rhythm moisture punch is not heavy like a moisturizer, it's a serum ,you might need additional moisturizer over it, if your skin is dry or less oily... my skin has oil reservoirs underneath &amp; thus for me this serum itself serves as the moisturizer &amp; doesn't leave a heavy feel. \n\ncons:- the inconsistent texture of it is a major con..some bottles feel like water &amp; get absorbed in under 2 mins,some bottles apply like a sticky liquid &amp; take a whole 20 mins to dry off..but regardless both heal the skin barrier when skin is red &amp; burning. Also post application they both dry to touch &amp; don't feel heavy at all. It absorbs like plain water.\n\nearth rhythm moisture punch \n\nIngredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Propanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer- 6, Bis-Ethoxydiglycol Cyclohexane 1,4-Dicarboxylate, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Laminaria Digitata Extract &amp; Cetyl-Pg Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide &amp; Ceramide 1 &amp; Ceramide 2 &amp; Ceramide 3 &amp; Ceramide 4 &amp; Ceramide 6 li, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Triethylene Glycol.\n\nformularx:FULL INGREDIENTS\n\nWater, glycerin, propanediol, panthenol, sodium hyaluronate, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VPcopolymer, ceramide np, ectoin, sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, sodium acetylated hyaluronate , xylityglucoside, hydrolyzed sodium hyaluronate , anhydroxylitol, pentylene glycol, xylitol, dicaprylyl ether, disdium edta, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin",

      "content": "Hi everyone, I’d love some advice because I’m a bit conflicted about my current routine.\n\nI naturally have wavy hair (around 2b/2c), but I’ve never really liked my wave pattern. I’ve been straightening my hair for years, and I’ve tried going wavy multiple times using mousse, different techniques, scrunching, etc., but it never worked for me. Honestly, the wavy styling often made my face look rounder/puffier, which I didn’t love.\n\nRecently I switched to higher-end products and the difference is very noticeable. My hair is no longer frizzy or electrically charged, and it looks much smoother and healthier overall.\n\nMy current routine is:\n\n1. Redken Frizz Dismiss shampoo\n\n (the red one)\n\n2. Redken Frizz Dismiss conditioner\n\n3. Color Wow Dream Coat Extra Strenght (I use it as an anti-frizz product and heat protectant)\n\nHere’s my concern:\n\nmy natural wave pattern seems almost gone at this point. My hair dries fairly straight even without using a flat iron, which makes me wonder:\n\n\t•\tIs this a good sign (healthier, better-sealed hair)?\n\n\t•\tOr could it mean I’m over-smoothing / weighing down my hair with products?\n\n\t•\tIs it possible that these products are great for straight styles but not ideal if I ever want to recover my natural waves?\n\nI’m not sure if the lack of waves is just the result of years of straightening, or if my current products are actively suppressing my texture.\n\nI’d like to eventually try to bring back my waves, maybe with a different technique, but before changing everything I want to understand if my routine is actually appropriate for my hair type.\n\nAny insight would be really appreciated ",

I use Tretinoin and from the research I did online, it seemed like a good cream to keep your face moisturized when using Tretinoin. I have been using it for well over a year but have had a sneaking suspicion that the little whiteheads that I can basically scrape off gently are caused by the Illiyoon cream. I stopped using this cream and used Tret with only the Isntree gel cream, which I’m learning may not be enough moisture for Tretinoin, especially in combination with the harsher winter air. I’ve since taken a break from Tretinoin and have only been using the Isntree, but my skin feels tight/dry when it is typically oily/combo. I’ve attached a picture of my skin (wrinkling my forehead) if that helps y’all determine if my skin is dehydrated it or not. I ordered the Aestura Ato Barrier 365 Cream and it should arrive tomorrow. I’m hoping it won’t break me out and will bring my skin back to its normal state, but wanted to ask for other suggestions, especially from people who use Tretinoin and/or have broken out from the Illiyoon cream. Thanks very much in advance!\n\nMy routine (which I’m currently workshopping 🤪):\n\nAM: Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser, Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream, Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream, Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel (SPF)\n\nPM: Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil, same Cerave cleanser as AM, Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream, Tretinoin .025% (every other night) Gel, Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream",

None, wash slap oil (Argan oil of Morocco) on it (just on my ends because I could cause a grease fire with my scalp) and call it a day. Not the greatest but I wanted to know what advice you can all give me. I want to try and define my curls but I don’t know where to start. My hair is a frizzy mess and tangles galore, so if anyone can recommend some products, something not too heavy and techniques to help my curls? I am planning on investing in a bonnet and or pillow case (I move a lot in my sleep so we’ll see if the bonnet stays on) but honestly I need the products yall swear by, creams, mousses, brushes, anything would be super helpful!!
