Pineappling gives me flat roots and weird kinks at the ponytail line, silk scarves slide off my head within an hour of falling asleep (even the ones with ties, idk how), braids leave me with a texture that looks nothing like my actual curl pattern.\n\nI've been doing a loose gather at the crown into a satin bonnet and it's the first method that doesn't completely destroy my definition by morning, though I did have to try like four different bonnets before finding one that actually stays on my head. The one from kitsch has been good, double layered and doesn't slide around.\n\naaand this is my wash day routine for context: I cleanse with the kitsch rice water bar, condition with mielle pomegranate and honey, scrunch in aussie instant freeze while soaking wet, diffuse to maybe 80% dry then air dry the rest. Sleep with fully dry hair only, that's been key... wet or even damp hair in a bonnet is a frizz disaster waiting to happen. Morning refresh is just a light water mist and scrunching, sometimes a tiny bit more kinky curly gel if things are really flat.",

      "content": "Hi everyone!\nI’m (27F) looking for some honest hair advice and opinions because I feel a bit lost.\n\nI’ve had naturally curly hair my whole life, but I never really learned how to take care of it. Growing up, I often received more compliments when my hair was straight, and like many people at a young age, I was just looking for external validation. For one reason or another, I’ve been straightening my hair for over 10 years now.\n\nIn the pictures, you can see my natural hair after washing it with shampoo, conditioner, and a mask, and letting it air dry. I don’t use any styling products yet. My hair has a lot of volume, feels dry, and gets very frizzy. I know it’s curly/wavy, but I honestly don’t know what curl type I have.\n\nMy main dilemma is about my next hair salon visit because part of me wants to start healing my hair and trying to recover my natural curls properly. But another part of me loves how highlights look on me when my hair is straight. I really like the vibe and how it makes me feel.\n\nI know that if I truly start caring for my curls, bleaching/highlights probably aren’t a good idea, at least for a while. So I’m torn between two things:\n\n•Committing to my natural curls and starting a proper routine (and if so, where do I even start?), or\n\n•Continuing with highlights and straightening, even if it means delaying curl recovery.\n\nI’d really appreciate if you could help me identify my hair type or curl pattern, an advice on whether it makes sense to “heal first” before doing anything chemical and a beginner-friendly tips if I decide to embrace my curls (products, habits, expectations, etc.)\n\nThanks so much for reading. Any insight or personal experience would mean a lot 🤍",

I have fine hair that gets oily very fast (within 24 hours - even with \"hair training\"), but my ends are dry and frizzy. My hair gets weighed down easily and really seems to hate buildup. My biggest issue is finding something that cleans my scalp without stripping it, hydrates my ends, helps with frizz, and *doesn’t* leave that weird dry / sticky / coated feeling after conditioning.\n\nI’ve tried countless shampoos and conditioners over the years — salon, “clean,” and drugstore. The only combo that has ever consistently worked for me was L’Oréal Elvive Dream Lengths. My hair felt soft and manageable and didn’t feel stripped. That said, lately I’ve noticed my hair gets oily again *really* fast after using it, and I’m starting to think it might be coating my hair over time and causing buildup.\n\nI *prefer more natural or cleaner-leaning formulas*, but I know that can be tricky with fine hair and oily scalps, so I’m open as long as it actually works long-term. Right now, I’m considering or researching the following options and would love real experiences (especially from fine-hair folks with oily roots):\n\nNexxus Ultralight Weightless **OR** [NatureLab.TOKYO](http://naturelab.tokyo/) PerfectVolume Shampoo and Conditioner **+** 2-in1 Clarifying Scalp Scrub and Shampoo **OR** MKS Eco Nourish and Hydrate Fine Hair Shampoo and Conditioner.\n\nThoughts, opinions, or other recommendations that have worked for you?",

I should have spoke up but I was uncomfortable because she was simultaneously doing another client who had already been waiting a very long time for her to return and I could tell she was rushed (I hate so much when this happens). Anyways I tried to do them myself once I got home and absolutely hacked it. This was Jan 18th. I’ve been using topical minoxidil religiously twice daily since. \n\nThey are completely unwearable so I’ve been doing a y2k type small bump and wearing headbands. My main question is, at what length do I go to someone to have them try to work something, and what exactly do I ask for? I definitely don’t want true front bangs so I feel like my only options are the photos attached. But what’s the best route here? Keep them short or try to have the stylist bring in more hair? I look back and I honestly wanted more hair added to my bangs more than anything else. I just at least want to be ok looking at myself in mirror. ",

As you can see, it goes back and forth between raised and flat, red and pink, scabbed and smooth. It used to weep serous fluid constantly, but now it barely does.\n\nFrom what I’ve read, it’s a recurring nodule(?) due to the pore being damaged. I don’t believe it’s a cyst as there’s never been pus or a head. I was considering a tiny injection of a steroid to permanently relieve the area, but I’d rather not pay out of pocket.\n\nI’ve asked my derm what to do, and I’m just told to moisturize and leave it be.

I don’t currently apply the conditioner to my scalp; I scrunch up to my scalp but don’t directly apply the conditioner to my scalp. \n\n\\- I wait about 2 minutes after applying the conditioner, then brush my hair with a wide tooth comb. \n\n\\- I wait about 5 minutes before fully rinsing the conditioner out by scrunching under running water — I’ve seen some suggestions about leaving some conditioner (not fully rinsing), but I feel like I need to fully rinse it (out of habit because I tend to need to wash it sooner if I don’t) - please lmk your thoughts on this.\n\n\\- I then brush it again with the wide tooth comb while my hair is still soaking wet. \n\n—— I did just order a Kitsch Detangler Brush, which reviews said is good for wavy/curly hair. - I’ll update once I use it! \n\n\\- I then rinse it once more directly under the water, then scrunching again before getting out of the shower. \n\n**Drying:**\n\n\\- I squeeze &amp; scrunch excess water out of my hair as I’m getting out of the shower. \n\n\\- I then use a microfiber towel wrap to dry it- I scrunch it to dry it most of the way, then plop it in the microfiber towel and leave it for about 10 to 20 minutes (depends how much time I have lol). \n\n\\- I always end up combing through it with my fingers after plopping so it’s not as wild.. not sure if that impacts my results. \n\n**Styling:**\n\n\\- I don’t do anything to style it (the most I do is braid it/comb through with my fingers). \n\n\\- I don’t add additional products to it (since it gets weighed down easily). \n\n\\- I never feel like diffusing/blow drying it, so I’d prefer no-heat ideas.\n\n**Protection while sleeping:**\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case. \n\n\\- I also just ordered a silk bonnet to hopefully help with frizz, as my hair tends to get a lot more frizzy by day 2-3 of not washing it. \n\n**Refresh/General info:**\n\n\\- I don’t use any products/have a refresh routine currently. All I do is comb through it with my fingers or brush it with a wide tooth comb (I try to avoid brushing if I can though because it makes my hair more frizzy).. suggestions for this are much appreciated too! \n\n\\- My hair is usually type 2a immediately after washing (based on my understanding anyway, please see pics), but by day 2 to 3, my waves are much less defined and the frizz takes over.\n\nAll that being said, what suggestions do you all have to combat frizz and help my waves last longer between washes (products, hair care ideas, etc)? Is there anything I am doing that may be impacting my results?\n\nPics show my hair the day I washed it and then day 2-5 hair\n\nThanks in advance !!\n\nAdditional info: I tried to add links from amazon for the scalp massager, brush, and silk bonnet, but my post was automatically removed due to issues with the link- I’ll try to link in the comments if the sub allows me to.",

      "content": "Started a new skincare routine, but only a couple days after I started it my skin has been extremely dry and flaking (I think that's the right word for it), which has also caused wrinkles. Unflattering all around, to say the least. I stopped using the routine due to this, but my face has remained dry and flaky (more so than ever before, been a few days now).\n\nThe skincare routine in question:\n\nSkin 1004 Madagascar Centella light cleansing oil  \n*(I don't have the packaging with the ingredients anymore)*\n\nIdun mineral cleansing face &amp; eye mousse  \n*(Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Glycerin, Glycereth-2 Cocoate, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Phenoxyethanol, Malic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Sodium PCA, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dehydroacetic Acid, Magnesium PCA, Zinc PCA, Potassium Sorbate)*\n\nACO face clean lotion  \n*(Water, Paraffinum Liquidum, Canola Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-6, Isopropyl Myristate, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate)*\n\nACO glow exfoliant  \n*(Water, Gluconolactone, Glycolic Acid, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Panthenol Betaine, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate)*\n\nWorth noting is the fact that I use the exfoliant only a few times a week, as well as the fact that the exfoliant and lotion are not new additions to the routine. The lotion was also fine previously, but with the addition of the cleansing oil and the mousse, the lotion has started burning when applied.  \nWhen doing the skincare routine mentioned, my face also feels quite tight and uncomfortable.\n\nI am guessing the issue is that the routine is a bit too harsh for my skin, and due to the lotion including alcohol.  \nAny suggestions on substitutions and possible additions is very welcome, as well as suggestions for how I should deal with the sky dryness this has caused.",

The back story is my skin is naturally dry, so to apply foundation, I have to move fast off a freshly moisturised face, otherwise my skin is too dry to accept the foundation / concealer / other base product causing it to look crumbly. I have tried everything including boosting my skincare, using serums, etc. - I really do need a freshly moisturised face to be able to work on a foundation or concealer.\n\nEver since I incorporated SPF into my routine (moisturiser followed by SPF), I let the SPF dry fully so it can form a film. That leaves me with a dilemma for makeup application because my face is now too dry.\n\nI am finding conflicting information online as to whether I could apply a moisturiser to my face again, after SPF, so that I can properly apply foundation?

      "content": "I have malasezzia/fungal acne with very oily skin type , that even bare face requires blotting by tissues in the evening . No other moisturizer or serum suits my skin, to not further aggravate oiliness or to repair when skin barrier is irritated. Also it costs way less than the expensive, overrated moisturizer from formularx. So when i knew it's going to be discontinued ,i needed to stock up on this, cause my life literally depends on it. i guess this is the only affordable product with multiple ceramides &amp; 0 silicones &amp; 0 fragrances (ceramides in ingredients (Ceramide 1 &amp; Ceramide 2 &amp; Ceramide 3 &amp; Ceramide 4 &amp; Ceramide 6 ) ).\n\ni use tre &amp; azelaic acid , so i need ceramide-rich moisturizers to hydrate and repair the skin barrier to counteract the dryness, irritation, and peeling i.e often caused by Tre... I found  formula rx causing a excessively slick oily feel, minutes after application ,even though it quickly gets absorbed upon application &amp; it aggravates my fungal acne.\n\n also earth rhythm has way too many ceramides(Ceramide 1 &amp; Ceramide 2 &amp; Ceramide 3 &amp; Ceramide 4 &amp; Ceramide 6 ) than formularx(ceramide np) and you can feel the difference.. example when your skin is red &amp; burning due to excessive application of tre, formularx will burn wherever applied but earth rhythm will calm the barrier &amp; cool the skin &amp; heal the skin barrier...\n\nDisclaimer:- Earth rhythm moisture punch is not heavy like a moisturizer, it's a serum ,you might need additional moisturizer over it, if your skin is dry or less oily... my skin has oil reservoirs underneath &amp; thus for me this serum itself serves as the moisturizer &amp; doesn't leave a heavy feel. \n\ncons:- the inconsistent texture of it is a major con..some bottles feel like water &amp; get absorbed in under 2 mins,some bottles apply like a sticky liquid &amp; take a whole 20 mins to dry off..but regardless both heal the skin barrier when skin is red &amp; burning. Also post application they both dry to touch &amp; don't feel heavy at all. It absorbs like plain water.\n\nearth rhythm moisture punch \n\nIngredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Propanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer- 6, Bis-Ethoxydiglycol Cyclohexane 1,4-Dicarboxylate, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Laminaria Digitata Extract &amp; Cetyl-Pg Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide &amp; Ceramide 1 &amp; Ceramide 2 &amp; Ceramide 3 &amp; Ceramide 4 &amp; Ceramide 6 li, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Triethylene Glycol.\n\nformularx:FULL INGREDIENTS\n\nWater, glycerin, propanediol, panthenol, sodium hyaluronate, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VPcopolymer, ceramide np, ectoin, sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, sodium acetylated hyaluronate , xylityglucoside, hydrolyzed sodium hyaluronate , anhydroxylitol, pentylene glycol, xylitol, dicaprylyl ether, disdium edta, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin",

Not sure it its the products, technique OR I just need to give it time for my waves to come back. \n\nContext \n\n\\- I’ve always had a wave pattern\n\n\\- I get highlights 3 times a year \n\n\\- I use K18 every 3/4 washes \n\n\\- for years I’ve NOT treated my hair like it’s curly, simply rough blow drying it after the shower and then putting it into a bun or curling it with a curling wand once a week\n\n\\- when I blow dry my hair, it goes hugeeee and poofy\n\n\\- I really look after my hair as much as possible, but think I’ve been working against my texture for so long \n\n\\- wear a satin bonnet every night \n\n\\- for years I’ve roughly blow dried my hair, but since letting it air dry this takes hours and hours and hours (6-7 hours it can take to fully dry)\n\nRoutine/ what I’ve been trying:\n\n1. On dripping wet hair, use a leave in conditioner\n\n2. Then rake through the JVC air dry cream and start scrunching \n\n3. John Frieda curl mousse. Taking and scrunching that through.\n\n4. Then sometimes use a bit of gel, sometimes don’t (I’m trying to figure out what works). I try and use the prayer method and then scrunch the ends a bit. \n\n5. Air dry. I don’t own a diffuser (yet).\n\nShampoo and conditioner I use is Redken all soft range and Dove intensive repair. I also clarify once a week. Don’t know if these are ‘wavy’ friendly, but I bought them because I thought my texture was just dryness. My hair is defo dry, but using moisturising products never seemed to help with the frizz or dry ends. \n\nI’m really new to this, so haven’t got a clue what hair type I have, or what products to use. Suppose it’ll be a bit of trial and error, but any advice at all would be amazing as I’m not sure what I should or shouldn’t be doing 🥲",
