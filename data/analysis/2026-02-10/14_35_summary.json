This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

Pineappling gives me flat roots and weird kinks at the ponytail line, silk scarves slide off my head within an hour of falling asleep (even the ones with ties, idk how), braids leave me with a texture that looks nothing like my actual curl pattern.\n\nI've been doing a loose gather at the crown into a satin bonnet and it's the first method that doesn't completely destroy my definition by morning, though I did have to try like four different bonnets before finding one that actually stays on my head. The one from kitsch has been good, double layered and doesn't slide around.\n\naaand this is my wash day routine for context: I cleanse with the kitsch rice water bar, condition with mielle pomegranate and honey, scrunch in aussie instant freeze while soaking wet, diffuse to maybe 80% dry then air dry the rest. Sleep with fully dry hair only, that's been key... wet or even damp hair in a bonnet is a frizz disaster waiting to happen. Morning refresh is just a light water mist and scrunching, sometimes a tiny bit more kinky curly gel if things are really flat.",

      "content": "Hi everyone!\nI’m (27F) looking for some honest hair advice and opinions because I feel a bit lost.\n\nI’ve had naturally curly hair my whole life, but I never really learned how to take care of it. Growing up, I often received more compliments when my hair was straight, and like many people at a young age, I was just looking for external validation. For one reason or another, I’ve been straightening my hair for over 10 years now.\n\nIn the pictures, you can see my natural hair after washing it with shampoo, conditioner, and a mask, and letting it air dry. I don’t use any styling products yet. My hair has a lot of volume, feels dry, and gets very frizzy. I know it’s curly/wavy, but I honestly don’t know what curl type I have.\n\nMy main dilemma is about my next hair salon visit because part of me wants to start healing my hair and trying to recover my natural curls properly. But another part of me loves how highlights look on me when my hair is straight. I really like the vibe and how it makes me feel.\n\nI know that if I truly start caring for my curls, bleaching/highlights probably aren’t a good idea, at least for a while. So I’m torn between two things:\n\n•Committing to my natural curls and starting a proper routine (and if so, where do I even start?), or\n\n•Continuing with highlights and straightening, even if it means delaying curl recovery.\n\nI’d really appreciate if you could help me identify my hair type or curl pattern, an advice on whether it makes sense to “heal first” before doing anything chemical and a beginner-friendly tips if I decide to embrace my curls (products, habits, expectations, etc.)\n\nThanks so much for reading. Any insight or personal experience would mean a lot 🤍",

I didn’t use to have it before, but harsh cleansers and exfoliants tend to break me out and make my skin red and dry. I also have a lot of redness around my nose most of the time, it’s been an issue for years ever since I entered puberty. (It Looks way worse irl, the picture doesn’t capture it well)  I’m honestly not sure whether it’s irritation or some kind of hyperpigmentation, but I assume and hope it’s the former. \n\nAny advice or suggestions are very much appreciated.

      "content": "I’ve been going down the peptide rabbit hole lately and figured I’d share what I’ve actually learned / tried so far, because there’s a lot of vague hype around them.\n\nFirst thing: peptides are way less “instant” than stuff like acids or retinoids. If you’re expecting visible results in a week, you’ll probably think they do nothing. They’re more of a long game ingredient.\n\nWhat I have tried:\n\nBasic peptide serums (Matrixyl-type blends, nothing fancy or injectable obviously)\n\nUsing them consistently for \\~6-8 weeks, mostly at night\n\nLayering them on clean, slightly damp skin, before heavier creams\n\nWhat I noticed:\n\nSubtle improvement in skin texture and “bounce”\n\nMy skin felt healthier overall, but no dramatic wrinkle erasing or anything\n\nDefinitely more noticeable when I wasn’t also nuking my skin with actives every night\n\nWhat I haven’t tried (yet):\n\nCopper peptides (a bit scared of irritation and conflicting info)\n\nHigh-percentage peptide formulas claiming Botox-like effects\n\nMixing peptides with strong acids or vitamin C in the same routine\n\nWarnings / things I wish I knew earlier:\n\nPeptides don’t like low pH. If you’re using exfoliating acids or pure L-ascorbic acid vitamin C, use them at a different time of day.\n\nOverloading peptides + retinoids + acids can just cancel everything out or irritate your skin.\n\nA lot of peptide products are overpriced for what they are. More expensive ≠ better results here.\n\nMy honest take:\n\nPeptides are “supporting actors,” not main characters. They won’t replace sunscreen, retinoids, or basic barrier care. But if your routine is already solid and you want something gentle that helps long-term skin health, they make sense.\n\nCurious to hear from people who’ve used copper peptides long-term or noticed real differences over months, not days.",

I am a diffuse thinner which is very noticeable but I keep it buzzed mostly (I don't look good with it) I'm gonna go to the barber today and get a buzz cut with fibre added but I know it won't last the week and will eventually expose my bald head.\n\nShe doesn't like when I'm wearing hats and always wants me to do some fancy hairstyle but I always keep my head shaven and seems she ain't a big fan of that either. She was once like \"why did you cut your hair?\" This is putting pressure on me and I honestly don't think I could be with someone who prioritises physical features. Not saying she's like that but she puts a lot of emphasis on male grooming and hair being neat.\n\nAnother girl at work (27) commented about a guy who is balding and said she doesn't like that he cut his hair cause now he looks ugly and in my mind I was like \"He had no choice he is balding\".\n\nI hate how the younger generation just concentrates on things that are not super important like physical appearance and it just makes me feel even more insecure cause I'm balding myself. Sometimes I wish I was 40 so people wouldn't worry so much about me having hair or not.",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nLooking for some advice on what to do with my hair. I’m very new to trying wavy hair routines and haven’t found anything yet that’s totally working for me. Not sure it its the products, technique OR I just need to give it time for my waves to come back. \n\nContext \n\n\\- I’ve always had a wave pattern\n\n\\- I get highlights 3 times a year \n\n\\- I use K18 every 3/4 washes \n\n\\- for years I’ve NOT treated my hair like it’s curly, simply rough blow drying it after the shower and then putting it into a bun or curling it with a curling wand once a week\n\n\\- when I blow dry my hair, it goes hugeeee and poofy\n\n\\- I really look after my hair as much as possible, but think I’ve been working against my texture for so long \n\n\\- wear a satin bonnet every night \n\n\\- for years I’ve roughly blow dried my hair, but since letting it air dry this takes hours and hours and hours (6-7 hours it can take to fully dry)\n\nRoutine/ what I’ve been trying:\n\n1. On dripping wet hair, use a leave in conditioner\n\n2. Then rake through the JVC air dry cream and start scrunching \n\n3. John Frieda curl mousse. Taking and scrunching that through.\n\n4. Then sometimes use a bit of gel, sometimes don’t (I’m trying to figure out what works). I try and use the prayer method and then scrunch the ends a bit. \n\n5. Air dry. I don’t own a diffuser (yet).\n\nShampoo and conditioner I use is Redken all soft range and Dove intensive repair. I also clarify once a week. Don’t know if these are ‘wavy’ friendly, but I bought them because I thought my texture was just dryness. My hair is defo dry, but using moisturising products never seemed to help with the frizz or dry ends. \n\nI’m really new to this, so haven’t got a clue what hair type I have, or what products to use. Suppose it’ll be a bit of trial and error, but any advice at all would be amazing as I’m not sure what I should or shouldn’t be doing 🥲",

No other moisturizer or serum suits my skin, to not further aggravate oiliness or to repair when skin barrier is irritated. Also it costs way less than the expensive, overrated moisturizer from formularx. So when i knew it's going to be discontinued ,i needed to stock up on this, cause my life literally depends on it. i guess this is the only affordable product with multiple ceramides &amp; 0 silicones &amp; 0 fragrances (ceramides in ingredients (Ceramide 1 &amp; Ceramide 2 &amp; Ceramide 3 &amp; Ceramide 4 &amp; Ceramide 6 ) ).\n\ni use tre &amp; azelaic acid , so i need ceramide-rich moisturizers to hydrate and repair the skin barrier to counteract the dryness, irritation, and peeling i.e often caused by Tre... I found  formula rx causing a excessively slick oily feel, minutes after application ,even though it quickly gets absorbed upon application &amp; it aggravates my fungal acne.\n\n also earth rhythm has way too many ceramides(Ceramide 1 &amp; Ceramide 2 &amp; Ceramide 3 &amp; Ceramide 4 &amp; Ceramide 6 ) than formularx(ceramide np) and you can feel the difference.. example when your skin is red &amp; burning due to excessive application of tre, formularx will burn wherever applied but earth rhythm will calm the barrier &amp; cool the skin &amp; heal the skin barrier...\n\nDisclaimer:- Earth rhythm moisture punch is not heavy like a moisturizer, it's a serum ,you might need additional moisturizer over it, if your skin is dry or less oily... my skin has oil reservoirs underneath &amp; thus for me this serum itself serves as the moisturizer &amp; doesn't leave a heavy feel. \n\ncons:- the inconsistent texture of it is a major con..some bottles feel like water &amp; get absorbed in under 2 mins,some bottles apply like a sticky liquid &amp; take a whole 20 mins to dry off..but regardless both heal the skin barrier when skin is red &amp; burning. Also post application they both dry to touch &amp; don't feel heavy at all. It absorbs like plain water.\n\nearth rhythm moisture punch \n\nIngredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Propanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer- 6, Bis-Ethoxydiglycol Cyclohexane 1,4-Dicarboxylate, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Laminaria Digitata Extract &amp; Cetyl-Pg Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide &amp; Ceramide 1 &amp; Ceramide 2 &amp; Ceramide 3 &amp; Ceramide 4 &amp; Ceramide 6 li, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Triethylene Glycol.\n\nformularx:FULL INGREDIENTS\n\nWater, glycerin, propanediol, panthenol, sodium hyaluronate, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VPcopolymer, ceramide np, ectoin, sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, sodium acetylated hyaluronate , xylityglucoside, hydrolyzed sodium hyaluronate , anhydroxylitol, pentylene glycol, xylitol, dicaprylyl ether, disdium edta, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin",

I should have spoke up but I was uncomfortable because she was simultaneously doing another client who had already been waiting a very long time for her to return and I could tell she was rushed (I hate so much when this happens). Anyways I tried to do them myself once I got home and absolutely hacked it. This was Jan 18th. I’ve been using topical minoxidil religiously twice daily since. \n\nThey are completely unwearable so I’ve been doing a y2k type small bump and wearing headbands. My main question is, at what length do I go to someone to have them try to work something, and what exactly do I ask for? I definitely don’t want true front bangs so I feel like my only options are the photos attached. But what’s the best route here? Keep them short or try to have the stylist bring in more hair? I look back and I honestly wanted more hair added to my bangs more than anything else. I just at least want to be ok looking at myself in mirror. ",

The back story is my skin is naturally dry, so to apply foundation, I have to move fast off a freshly moisturised face, otherwise my skin is too dry to accept the foundation / concealer / other base product causing it to look crumbly. I have tried everything including boosting my skincare, using serums, etc. - I really do need a freshly moisturised face to be able to work on a foundation or concealer.\n\nEver since I incorporated SPF into my routine (moisturiser followed by SPF), I let the SPF dry fully so it can form a film. That leaves me with a dilemma for makeup application because my face is now too dry.\n\nI am finding conflicting information online as to whether I could apply a moisturiser to my face again, after SPF, so that I can properly apply foundation? Alternatively, would a tinted moisturiser be okay to apply on top? For those of you who are makeup aficionados...how do you manage to apply it without disrupting your sunscreen? I use LRP Anthelios.

      "title": "[Routine Help]  Face extremely dry after new skincare routine",
      "content": "Started a new skincare routine, but only a couple days after I started it my skin has been extremely dry and flaking (I think that's the right word for it), which has also caused wrinkles. Unflattering all around, to say the least. I stopped using the routine due to this, but my face has remained dry and flaky (more so than ever before, been a few days now).\n\nThe skincare routine in question:\n\nSkin 1004 Madagascar Centella light cleansing oil  \n*(I don't have the packaging with the ingredients anymore)*\n\nIdun mineral cleansing face &amp; eye mousse  \n*(Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Glycerin, Glycereth-2 Cocoate, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Phenoxyethanol, Malic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Sodium PCA, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dehydroacetic Acid, Magnesium PCA, Zinc PCA, Potassium Sorbate)*\n\nACO face clean lotion  \n*(Water, Paraffinum Liquidum, Canola Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-6, Isopropyl Myristate, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate)*\n\nACO glow exfoliant  \n*(Water, Gluconolactone, Glycolic Acid, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Panthenol Betaine, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate)*\n\nWorth noting is the fact that I use the exfoliant only a few times a week, as well as the fact that the exfoliant and lotion are not new additions to the routine. The lotion was also fine previously, but with the addition of the cleansing oil and the mousse, the lotion has started burning when applied.  \nWhen doing the skincare routine mentioned, my face also feels quite tight and uncomfortable.\n\nI am guessing the issue is that the routine is a bit too harsh for my skin, and due to the lotion including alcohol.  \nAny suggestions on substitutions and possible additions is very welcome, as well as suggestions for how I should deal with the sky dryness this has caused.",
