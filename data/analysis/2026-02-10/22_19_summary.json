      "content": "Before I get into the routine I’m basically looking to start completely new. I don’t think our routine is working and I feel like I’m doing things wrong. I use to keep my daughters hair mostly in braids to prevent tangles/matting and she would like to wear it down more so I’m trying to find what works best for wearing it down most the time. \n\nSome things to keep in mind: she has fine hair and a lot of it. Her hair is very dry and tangles and gets matt’s within hours of being down. Her head is very sensitive and the detangling process is very draining for us both filled with lots of tears and breaks because it hurts. \n\nThe routine: I aim to wash it once a week but if she wears it down we have to wash it again in order to get the tangles out. I get it soaking wet and shampoo and condition it with aussie miracle curls. I let the conditioner sit and start detangling with a detangling brush. I have to rewet it several times during this because it drys so fast and takes so long. Then we rinse and wring it out and spray it with the shea moisture leave in detangler. I then detangle it again and braid it in a simple braid to prevent tangles until we are going somewhere. When it’s time for school I rewet it and add in a light hold gel. I buy a different drug store one every time in hopes something works better. At night we put it in a satin bonnet and rewet in the morning to refresh it. By day 2/3 the mats have gotten so bad that I have to wash and do the detangling process again and we end up braiding it because she doesn’t want to do that again in another 2 days. I feel bad because she wants to wear it down all the time but the detangling process is so horrible for her. One question I do want to know for sure is should I be detangling it everyday? I’m just worried about damaging and drying her hair out more. \n\nMy detangling process is in the bath hair soaking wet with conditioner in it we start on one side working from the bottom up in small sections. She unfortunately just gets such bad mats so quickly it’s a painful process for her and I’m hoping with the correct products or routine this could be easier? \n\nAny help or input is so appreciated. \n\nThe first picture is how it looks when rewetting to try and refresh on day 2. The second picture is how it looks day 1. ",

Since then, it has grown quite a bit, although it’s noticeably **finer than it used to be**. I’m very grateful for it and now trying to fully **embrace my natural curls** as it continues to grow.\n\nI’ve always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with my hair. It was wavy when I was younger and became curly in my 20s, but I struggled with frizz and lack of definition. In the past, I often kept it short, but this time I’d like to let it grow and learn how to take care of it properly without relying on heat.\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n1) Cleanse\n   * *Cantu Sulfate-Free Cleansing Cream Shampoo*\n   * Alternated with a hard water shampoo (used occasionally for buildup)\n2) Condition\n   * *Acure Smooth &amp; Shine Conditioner\n   * Applied mainly to mid-lengths and ends, then rinsed out\n3) Styling (on soaking-wet or very damp hair):\n   * *Cantu Curl Activator Cream* **or**\n   * *SheaMoisture Curl Mousse* (lighter option)\n   * *Aveda smoothing cream used in the past, not very effective.*\n4) Application technique:\n   * Products applied with hands using light raking, followed by scrunching\n   * No brushes used for styling\n5) Drying:**\n   * Air-dry in summer\n   * In colder months, partial dry mixed with diffusing\n\n The photo I’m referencing is a day post-wash and my curls still look messy and undefined to me.\n\n**Hair &amp; Lifestyle Info**\n\n* Fine, curly hair (post-chemo regrowth)\n* Side sleeper\n* Full-time job + kids\n* Prefer a **simple routine under 20 minutes**\n\n**What I’m Looking For**\n\nI’d love recommendations for:\n\n* Products that give **better curl definition** for fine hair\n* Lightweight gels, mousses, or creams that help reduce frizz\n* Tips for improving **day-1 and next-day curls**\n* Low-effort nighttime protection options\n\nThank you so much in advance — any advice is truly appreciated 💛",

So I used regular keratin treatments to straighten it. I stopped doing keratin 2.5–3 years ago. Since then, I’ve cut my hair multiple times, but the ends still look straight and weird, whereas the roots come out curly, so it means the keratin isnt the problem as I have chopped off the part that was straightened by the Keratin.\n\nI also haven’t used any heat styling or straightening in over 6 months.\n\nMy current routine:\n\nShampoo/Conditioner: Head &amp; Shoulders \n\nLeave-in: Garnier Method for Curls mask\n\nCantu Shea Butter Wave Whip Curling Mouse\n\nCantu Shea Butter Moisturizing Twist Lock &amp; Curl Gel\n\nMethod: Scrunch, then use a microfiber towel to scrunch more\n\nDrying: Air dry a bit, then diffuse\n\nFinishing: Aussie Work That Curl lightweight oil\n\nMy question\n\nWhat can I do to help my ends curl?\n\nDo I even have curly hair, or is it hopeless?\n\nWhy do the ends stay straight even after months of no heat and regular cutting?\n\nAny help or suggestions would be amazing.

      "content": "Hi all :) 2 before &amp; 1 after photo posted but also need routine advice!!! England Based. \n\nI recently had a completely random, on one side of the face, out of the blue moment of what the GP said was most likely acne rosacea. I’m 27F, never had acne before, would have the occasional spot which would go away in a week, yknow average spot timeline. \n\nNo idea what caused it, no changes to lifestyle or diet, skincare routine etc. Always had oily combination skin, then this acne situation made it suuuuper dry and flaky and my skin is probably still recovering from this. \n\nI was prescribed Finacea 15% Gel Azelaic Acid which cleared my face up wonderfully after about 12 days of consistent use. \n\nMy routine before all of this was all The Ordinary:  Squalane Cleanser -&gt; Glycolic 7% Toner -&gt; Hyaluronic 2% Acid Serum -&gt; Moisturising Factors with Beta Glucan. \n\nI stopped my routine completely once this acne had happened and switched to La Roche Posay Effaclar Cleanser and Cicaplast b5 Balm to try and soothe the skin as was advised by a skincare professional before I knew what this was. Didn’t work then got prescribed the Finacea. \n\nSince using the Finacea I haven’t had a skincare routine at all. Just washed face with warm water and started using Clinisoothe Hypochlorus Acid spray which I’ve had good results with before. \n\nQuestion is what do I do now? In England so can’t afford a private dermatologist, and I’m not putting myself through the NHS process for a skincare issue. \n\nHow to get back to a decent routine, do I keep using the Azaleic Acid gel, can I restart my routine or do I ease back into a routine, was The Ordinary routine acceptable? Do I keep using La Roche Posay instead? \n\nThis acne situation has really thrown me for a loop as it’s never happened to me before. \n\nBest wishes to you all 😄",

      "content": "Growing up, I naturally had soft, manageable 2a/2b wavy-curly hair that was healthy and mid-back length. But I was always insecure about it for no reason and wanted straight hair like girls on tv, so I’d beg my mom to straighten it. But my hair still stayed healthy and didn’t change its curl pattern. \n\nIn middle school, after a very short haircut I hated (the girl cut my hair to my ears I had a bob), and would straighten it myself out of insecurity. At the same time, frequent chlorine exposure from swimming without proper care caused dryness and damage.  I began straightening my hair improperly using high heat on damp/oily hair and sometimes with chlorine residue still in it (since I straightened it by myself, I didn’t know how to care for it properly and didn’t know about heat protection. My cousin told me if I drenched my hair in heat protectant and then I straighten on top and if I hear sizzling, that meant the protectant is working. So I would always aim for the sizzling sound because I was stupid) . Over time, the more heat I used, the more my hair became frizzier, drier, and curlier, eventually turning into tight, hard-to-manage curls (around 3b/3c texture) that didn’t behave like typical healthy curls.\n\nIn high school, I continued straightening daily. Later, I tried to repair the damage by avoiding heat, using oils, masks, trims, and growth routines (especially during COVID). While my hair grows, it still feels dry, frizzy, and inconsistent, with recurring dead ends. Even curly hair routines haven’t helped, and defining the curls isn’t what I want anyway. I miss my old soft, loose waves, not tight curls.\n\nI’m 22 now and it’s been years since I started handling my hair with better care. I now use heat more responsibly, but my hair still doesn’t feel like my natural texture. I don’t believe this change is hormonal, it feels like long-term structural damage from years of chlorine + improper heat use, and I’m exhausted from trying products and routines that haven’t restored my original pattern.\n\nMain goal:\nI want my hair to return to its original soft 2a/2b wave pattern, not tighter curls, and I don’t know how to achieve that after years of damage.\n\nRoutine: I’ve used so many different products over the years from cheap to expensive. I’ve used all the famous ones and even the normal ones. They’re all eh. I don’t diffuse, my hairs already so curly and coily and frizzy the last thing I want to do is define them and scrunch them, it will turn into a big bush. I\n\n",

I have fine hair that gets oily very fast (within 24 hours - even with \"hair training\"), but my ends are dry and frizzy. My hair gets weighed down easily and really seems to hate buildup. My biggest issue is finding something that cleans my scalp without stripping it, hydrates my ends, helps with frizz, and *doesn’t* leave that weird dry / sticky / coated feeling after conditioning.\n\nI’ve tried countless shampoos and conditioners over the years — salon, “clean,” and drugstore. The only combo that has ever consistently worked for me was L’Oréal Elvive Dream Lengths. My hair felt soft and manageable and didn’t feel stripped. That said, lately I’ve noticed my hair gets oily again *really* fast after using it, and I’m starting to think it might be coating my hair over time and causing buildup.\n\nI *prefer more natural or cleaner-leaning formulas*, but I know that can be tricky with fine hair and oily scalps, so I’m open as long as it actually works long-term. Right now, I’m considering or researching the following options and would love real experiences (especially from fine-hair folks with oily roots):\n\nNexxus Ultralight Weightless **OR** [NatureLab.TOKYO](http://naturelab.tokyo/) PerfectVolume Shampoo and Conditioner **+** 2-in1 Clarifying Scalp Scrub and Shampoo **OR** MKS Eco Nourish and Hydrate Fine Hair Shampoo and Conditioner.\n\nThoughts, opinions, or other recommendations that have worked for you?",

      "content": "**The issue(s) I need help with:**\n\nI feel like I’ve finally started moving in a better direction with my 44 yo skin after struggling for most of my life, but I’m not convinced I’m doing things in the smartest or most effective way yet. After years of trying so many products that didn't work, I'm a bit skeptical.\n\nI’m wondering:\n\n* Does my routine make sense for acne-prone, dry/dehydrated skin?\n* Am I balancing hydration, barrier support, and gentle exfoliation correctly?\n* Are there moisturizer alternatives to Biossance Squalane + Omega Repair that are just as good for me, but less expensive?\n* I still have some congestion/clogged pores — is my current approach likely to keep improving that, or am I missing something obvious?\n* Would you recommend any changes or subs?\n\nI feel like the skin care world has become a whole new language I need to learn and it's a bit daunting, but everyone here seems so knowledgeable, so I’d really appreciate guidance.\n\n**Skin type**\n\nThis is part of my confusion. My skin has always **looked dry** but sometimes **felt oily**. And so many acne products are meant for oily skin, but mine was super dry.\n\n* I grew up in AZ and now live in upstate NY, so I’ve had dry-climate skin most of my life.\n* Most of the year here is cold and dry. Def need stronger moisturizers than the average.\n* During a few short summer months, I lean more combo.\n* I’m acne-prone and very clog-prone.\n* I wear makeup daily (Milk foundation has been a great dewy moisturizing find for me).\n\n**Current routine**\n\n**AM &amp; PM**\n\n* La Roche-Posay Gentle Cleanser *or* Biossance Cleanser\n* ANUA Rice Ceramide 7 Hydrating Barrier Serum\n* Biossance Squalane + Omega Repair Cream\n* La Roche-Posay Cicaplast on top when I’m feeling especially dry\n\nOccasionally\n\n* Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid — about 1-2x per week\n\nThe BHA is definitely drying for me, but I find the Cicaplast usually helps my skin recover within about 2 days.\n\n**How long I’ve been using this routine**\n\nUntil two weeks ago, I was only cleansing with LRP and using Kiehl's moisturizer. I was on the hunt for a better moisturizer for this crazy cold winter and went down a Reddit rabbit hole to find better skin care. After this brand new routine, I've noticed:\n\n* Fewer clogged pores\n* Smoother texture\n* Dewier-looking skin\n* Less dryness under makeup\n* No breakouts for two weeks, which is HUGE for me\n\nMy skin isn’t “perfect,” but it looks MUCH better than it did. It's a noticeable difference.\n\n**Anything new I introduced that may have changed my skin**\n\nBiggest change: shifting away from the “exfoliate more” mindset I followed for years.\n\nFor most of my life I was told by experts to exfoliate more, use acne products, scrub, and “turn over skin faster”, double cleanse, etc. That became my default approach, but none of this worked and honestly made me feel like most products were just marketing gimmicks. I knew my skin was dry, but moisturizers didn't seem to help enough.\n\nRecently, after my skin got extremely dry, I tried the Biossance moisture mini kit on a Sephora rep’s recommendation. Within a few days I noticed fewer clogged pores and no new breakouts — not a full transformation, but enough to rethink what my skin actually needs. I also didn't feel the Biossance moisturizer was enough for my skin. The ANUA Rice Ceramide Serum has been the standout — I’ve never really used serums before or seen dramatic results from any product, but this one noticeably reduced congestion and made my skin look dewy within a couple days! So curious if anyone thinks another moisturizer would work just as effectively but maybe with a lesser price tag or should I just stick with what is working?? Anything else you think I should try or switch up?\n\nI hope I gave all the info you'd need and look forward to hearing any feedback! 💛",

I had to go to just moisturiser and water and it’s healed a bit (as you can see in the photos. 1st photo was during flare up, 2nd is now).\n\nBut I want to get a routine down but I don’t know what’s good. I’m currently on a moisturiser I love and I introduced squaline oil which my skin doesn’t mind. I wanna potentially introduce back a cleanser, and at some point maybe a serum. Anything that will support my skin barrier and hydration as it’s still very dry even with a heavy moisturiser and the oil.\n\nWould oil or cream cleaner be best? Is there any good cleanser recommendations for senstive, very dry skin?\n\nAnd any other products that may help hydration and calm my skin? A few weeks ago I tried 10% azelaic acid and I stopped because my skin started feeling more tight. Thank you!",
