      "content": "My hair loss was something which affected me for more than 20 years. Hair transplant were not succesful 20 yrs back and I had Norwood Grade 7 at 25 yrs of age. Today I m nearing 45 yrs . \n\nI did a ton of research about hair transplant  in last 10 yrs and was with a hair patch for last 15 yrs. \n\nIt affected my confidence . In 2024 I finally decided to give hair transplant  a good chance and decided to use my scalp,  beard and chest .\n\n During my research in Patna , where I resided , I found my doctor through a google search. I was mentally prepared to go to Delhi. Seeing his past affiliation of doc , I decided to meet. \n\n He said \" you are my second patient in the city where I have newly moved in and we both have nothing to loose as you go back to the hair patch if the transplant fails , but if it is successful , it can be life changing. We will have a 3 to 4 Surgical  sitting  approach over next 1.5 yrs to protect donor aesthetics of scalp and body. We will use your beard in the hairline and crown over multiple sittings  and beard in the rest. He put his bet on my beard which is extremely good. I linked his multi step approach with a conservative hairline initially.\n\nSurgical procedure breakdown:\n\n• 1st procedure - total of 3300 grafts- 1300 from scalp ( very thin donor ), 2000 from beard ( He extracted beard below jawline and side locks ) . This covered my conservative hairline and mid scalp.\n\n• 2nd procedure-total of 2300 grafts- about 1500 from beard and about 800 chest( Further extraction from beard below jawline  and from cheek, 800 from chest 70% of which failed ) . This was used to construct my crown and back part of the head.\n\n• 3rd procedure-total of 2000 grafts- about 1000 from the scalp( these were finasteride dependent hair which thickened with 1 year of finasteride  and about 1000 from beard ( from neck, cheek ) \n\nTotal number of grafts so far = \\~7600 grafts\n\nA primary reason for this approach in regards to procedure was to manage the existing donor hair as well as achieve realistic density. \n\nExperience and recovery:\n\nMy 3 surgeries took 1 year and were placed 6 months apart. The approach was always conservative to slightly aggresive. There was risk of scarring on my cheek and practically after 3 times extraction from my cheek , sidelocks and below neck , there are virtually no visible scar, thanks to excellent post op care guided by the doc and executed my me.\n\n My final results is still 4 months away and last surgery was done in September 2025.\n\nResults (so far): \n\nI’m not trying to boast or claim that I have a “celebrity hairline”, but my observations indicate that hair growth is naturally improving, and I am beginning to feel comfortable again with my hairline as my confidence grows.\n\n I feel confident to go out without a hair fibres or a wig now. Doctor has suggested to go for scalp micropigmentation to further reduce the contrast and recommended use of chest hair to improve my mid scalp  if have he stamina to go for a 4th surgery from chest .\n\nMy advice to anyone considering an HT for extreme high grade baldness with poor donor : \n\n1. Find a doctor who is capable of scalp and body hair transplant.\n\n2. Find a doctor whose approach is conservative to aggresive , rather than vice-versa ( else a failed surgery can't be rectified ) . Even the best donors can fail to grow and worst donor hair can grow.\n\n \n\n3. Wait for your baldness to stablize before surgery and stick to medications like finasteride and minoxidil .\n\n4. People who have good body hair especially beard ( it gave me 80% of the density over 3 surgeries ) should get a good coverage .\n\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to ask I mainly posted this in hopes of providing some insight or motivation to people who have virtually no hair..",

I’ve been a long time lurker on this sub and have done my fair share of research on finasteride. I’ve always been a little scared to try it but now I’m going to give it a go at a smaller dose to see if I can tolerate it. \n\nI spoke to my dermatologist about hair loss options and he suggested I first try oral minoxidil for 2-3 months before starting finasteride. His rationale was that if oral minoxidil leads to good gains then we can hold off on finasteride for a little longer. I was a little confused by this because the two medications are completely different mechanisms of treatment. I’ve done topical minoxidil for over 10 years now and the results have started to wane. The point of trying oral minoxidil was to see if it could help me more than topical is at the moment. Obviously not being on a DHT blocker all these years has led to a lot more loss.\n\nIs what my derm saying sound? I know there are plenty of people who take both oral minoxidil and finasteride at the same time. ",

      "content": "hi everyone! I wanted to ask what are the best cleansers and moisturizers for combination skin type. I would say my forehead will be oily yet my eyebrows can be a little dry sometimes. the sides of my nostrils will dry out and be flaky, but my nose can be a tiny bit oily occasionally.\n\nI only get hormonal acne once a month (iykyk). I rarely get any acne that turn into whiteheads. when I do have the hormonal acne, it may be 2-3 around my chin. I’ve noticed lately I’ve had a few on my cheeks and under my eye. I’m not sure why or what could be causing them. If you have any thoughts, please let me know. I did switch from my previous moisturizer drunk elephant to good molecule since DE can be expensive (I also would use the DE vitamin C serum but ran out). I’m not sure if that’s what’s causing the acne on my cheeks and if good molecule isn’t right for me.\n\nI do have bumps on my forehead that don’t really clear up. they never form whiteheads or anything. they’ll just be red for a day. does anyone have any recommendations on how to clear them up? also my pores on my nose for sure need to be cleansed. I’ve seen TikTok’s on oil cleanser/emulsify with water then going in with a water based cleanser. does this work?\n\nI currently use exuviance to wash my face. I initially had the gentle cleanser and it never broke me out. I couldn’t find it at Ulta and grabbed the AHA cleanser. not sure if this is something I should use or if you’d recommend it?\n\nany help and recommendations are much appreciated!",

The rest of my hair forms defined curls, but that back section stays almost straight or just slightly wavy. Has anyone else dealt with this? Could it be a natural texture difference, damage, or maybe the way I sleep or style it? I’d really appreciate any advice on how to encourage that section to curl more or blend better with the rest of my hair.\n\nMy routine:\n\n• I use a basic shampoo and conditioner.  \n\n• After washing, I comb my hair, bringing some to the front and some to the back, then apply products.  \n\n• I use Manetain leave-in conditioner, curly cream, and a small amount of hard-hold gel.  \n\n• I diffuse for some time and then let my hair air dry.  \n\n• I try to maintain my curls with these same products between washes.  \n\n• I sleep with a bonnet and use a silk pillowcase.",
