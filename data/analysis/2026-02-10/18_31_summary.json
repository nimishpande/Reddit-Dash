Pineappling gives me flat roots and weird kinks at the ponytail line, silk scarves slide off my head within an hour of falling asleep (even the ones with ties, idk how), braids leave me with a texture that looks nothing like my actual curl pattern.\n\nI've been doing a loose gather at the crown into a satin bonnet and it's the first method that doesn't completely destroy my definition by morning, though I did have to try like four different bonnets before finding one that actually stays on my head. The one from kitsch has been good, double layered and doesn't slide around.\n\naaand this is my wash day routine for context: I cleanse with the kitsch rice water bar, condition with mielle pomegranate and honey, scrunch in aussie instant freeze while soaking wet, diffuse to maybe 80% dry then air dry the rest. Sleep with fully dry hair only, that's been key... wet or even damp hair in a bonnet is a frizz disaster waiting to happen. Morning refresh is just a light water mist and scrunching, sometimes a tiny bit more kinky curly gel if things are really flat.",

      "content": "I have been dealing with thinning hair for a few years, and after a lot of research, I started considering a hair transplant abroad. What helped me most was doing detailed comparisons before committing.\n\nI used a platform called ꓧеаꓲtһꓧор to see different clinics, check what their packages included, and understand the cost breakdown. Some packages were all-inclusive with hotel stays, airport transfers, and follow-up care, while others just covered the procedure itself. Breaking this down helped me figure out what I actually needed and what would be extra.\n\nAnother important part was budgeting for recovery days and local transport. Staying close to the clinic and planning a few extra nights for rest helped me avoid last-minute stress and extra costs.\n\nResearching thoroughly and writing everything down made the process much less overwhelming. I felt more confident about making a decision knowing I understood the finances, the logistics, and what to expect.\n\nFor anyone thinking about a transplant abroad, planning and cost comparison first can save a lot of stress.\n\nHas anyone here planned a hair transplant overseas? How did you manage costs and logistics?",

      "content": "Before I get into the routine I’m basically looking to start completely new. I don’t think our routine is working and I feel like I’m doing things wrong. I use to keep my daughters hair mostly in braids to prevent tangles/matting and she would like to wear it down more so I’m trying to find what works best for wearing it down most the time. \n\nSome things to keep in mind: she has fine hair and a lot of it. Her hair is very dry and tangles and gets matt’s within hours of being down. Her head is very sensitive and the detangling process is very draining for us both filled with lots of tears and breaks because it hurts. \n\nThe routine: I aim to wash it once a week but if she wears it down we have to wash it again in order to get the tangles out. I get it soaking wet and shampoo and condition it with aussie miracle curls. I let the conditioner sit and start detangling with a detangling brush. I have to rewet it several times during this because it drys so fast and takes so long. Then we rinse and wring it out and spray it with the shea moisture leave in detangler. I then detangle it again and braid it in a simple braid to prevent tangles until we are going somewhere. When it’s time for school I rewet it and add in a light hold gel. I buy a different drug store one every time in hopes something works better. At night we put it in a satin bonnet and rewet in the morning to refresh it. By day 2/3 the mats have gotten so bad that I have to wash and do the detangling process again and we end up braiding it because she doesn’t want to do that again in another 2 days. I feel bad because she wants to wear it down all the time but the detangling process is so horrible for her. One question I do want to know for sure is should I be detangling it everyday? I’m just worried about damaging and drying her hair out more. \n\nMy detangling process is in the bath hair soaking wet with conditioner in it we start on one side working from the bottom up in small sections. She unfortunately just gets such bad mats so quickly it’s a painful process for her and I’m hoping with the correct products or routine this could be easier? \n\nAny help or input is so appreciated. \n\nThe first picture is how it looks when rewetting to try and refresh on day 2. The second picture is how it looks day 1. ",

I have fine hair that gets oily very fast (within 24 hours - even with \"hair training\"), but my ends are dry and frizzy. My hair gets weighed down easily and really seems to hate buildup. My biggest issue is finding something that cleans my scalp without stripping it, hydrates my ends, helps with frizz, and *doesn’t* leave that weird dry / sticky / coated feeling after conditioning.\n\nI’ve tried countless shampoos and conditioners over the years — salon, “clean,” and drugstore. The only combo that has ever consistently worked for me was L’Oréal Elvive Dream Lengths. My hair felt soft and manageable and didn’t feel stripped. That said, lately I’ve noticed my hair gets oily again *really* fast after using it, and I’m starting to think it might be coating my hair over time and causing buildup.\n\nI *prefer more natural or cleaner-leaning formulas*, but I know that can be tricky with fine hair and oily scalps, so I’m open as long as it actually works long-term. Right now, I’m considering or researching the following options and would love real experiences (especially from fine-hair folks with oily roots):\n\nNexxus Ultralight Weightless **OR** [NatureLab.TOKYO](http://naturelab.tokyo/) PerfectVolume Shampoo and Conditioner **+** 2-in1 Clarifying Scalp Scrub and Shampoo **OR** MKS Eco Nourish and Hydrate Fine Hair Shampoo and Conditioner.\n\nThoughts, opinions, or other recommendations that have worked for you?",

No other moisturizer or serum suits my skin, to not further aggravate oiliness or to repair when skin barrier is irritated. Also it costs way less than the expensive, overrated moisturizer from formularx. So when i knew it's going to be discontinued ,i needed to stock up on this, cause my life literally depends on it. i guess this is the only affordable product with multiple ceramides &amp; 0 silicones &amp; 0 fragrances (ceramides in ingredients (Ceramide 1 &amp; Ceramide 2 &amp; Ceramide 3 &amp; Ceramide 4 &amp; Ceramide 6 ) ).\n\ni use tre &amp; azelaic acid , so i need ceramide-rich moisturizers to hydrate and repair the skin barrier to counteract the dryness, irritation, and peeling i.e often caused by Tre... I found  formula rx causing a excessively slick oily feel, minutes after application ,even though it quickly gets absorbed upon application &amp; it aggravates my fungal acne.\n\n also earth rhythm has way too many ceramides(Ceramide 1 &amp; Ceramide 2 &amp; Ceramide 3 &amp; Ceramide 4 &amp; Ceramide 6 ) than formularx(ceramide np) and you can feel the difference.. example when your skin is red &amp; burning due to excessive application of tre, formularx will burn wherever applied but earth rhythm will calm the barrier &amp; cool the skin &amp; heal the skin barrier...\n\nDisclaimer:- Earth rhythm moisture punch is not heavy like a moisturizer, it's a serum ,you might need additional moisturizer over it, if your skin is dry or less oily... my skin has oil reservoirs underneath &amp; thus for me this serum itself serves as the moisturizer &amp; doesn't leave a heavy feel. \n\ncons:- the inconsistent texture of it is a major con..some bottles feel like water &amp; get absorbed in under 2 mins,some bottles apply like a sticky liquid &amp; take a whole 20 mins to dry off..but regardless both heal the skin barrier when skin is red &amp; burning. Also post application they both dry to touch &amp; don't feel heavy at all.

      "content": "I’m on the struggle bus for real. I always have had relatively oily-leaning combo skin, almost no acne (very lucky, I know). My skin was great tbh! Cut to about a year or two ago. I am now super dry, forehead is flakey, rosacea is rosaceaing, and I have tiny white heads all over. I’m not sure if it’s my age (28), or the fact that I had surgery to remove endometriosis which may have changed my hormone balance, but idk what to do with my skin now.\n\nI’ve tried to pivot my routine, but I can’t seem to get back to where I was and it’s a real bummer. I tried cutting out all actives for a while, and tbh it didn’t seem to help much. I’m still not using any acids, but I’ve added my gentle retinol back in and just target the application to avoid the dryer/more rosacea parts. Also, I have used an ivermectin cream for rosacea in the past and it helped very minimally. Tbh the rosacea is not even the biggest concern right now, I mostly mention it because it makes me more sensitive.\n\nThings I’ve changed:\n\n1.\t⁠Gentle cleanser (now use only a vanicream bar and the Geek &amp; Gorgeous cleaning balm)\n\n2.\t⁠Switched out acids for a milky toner (been using Bubble)\n\n3.\t⁠Got a more intense moisturizer (been using Cerave skin renewing night cream)\n\nThis is mostly a rant, but I’m open to suggestions.",

I don’t currently apply the conditioner to my scalp; I scrunch up to my scalp but don’t directly apply the conditioner to my scalp. \n\n\\- I wait about 2 minutes after applying the conditioner, then brush my hair with a wide tooth comb. \n\n\\- I wait about 5 minutes before fully rinsing the conditioner out by scrunching under running water — I’ve seen some suggestions about leaving some conditioner (not fully rinsing), but I feel like I need to fully rinse it (out of habit because I tend to need to wash it sooner if I don’t) - please lmk your thoughts on this.\n\n\\- I then brush it again with the wide tooth comb while my hair is still soaking wet. \n\n—— I did just order a Kitsch Detangler Brush, which reviews said is good for wavy/curly hair. - I’ll update once I use it! \n\n\\- I then rinse it once more directly under the water, then scrunching again before getting out of the shower. \n\n**Drying:**\n\n\\- I squeeze &amp; scrunch excess water out of my hair as I’m getting out of the shower. \n\n\\- I then use a microfiber towel wrap to dry it- I scrunch it to dry it most of the way, then plop it in the microfiber towel and leave it for about 10 to 20 minutes (depends how much time I have lol). \n\n\\- I always end up combing through it with my fingers after plopping so it’s not as wild.. not sure if that impacts my results. \n\n**Styling:**\n\n\\- I don’t do anything to style it (the most I do is braid it/comb through with my fingers). \n\n\\- I don’t add additional products to it (since it gets weighed down easily). \n\n\\- I never feel like diffusing/blow drying it, so I’d prefer no-heat ideas.\n\n**Protection while sleeping:**\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case. \n\n\\- I also just ordered a silk bonnet to hopefully help with frizz, as my hair tends to get a lot more frizzy by day 2-3 of not washing it. \n\n**Refresh/General info:**\n\n\\- I don’t use any products/have a refresh routine currently. All I do is comb through it with my fingers or brush it with a wide tooth comb (I try to avoid brushing if I can though because it makes my hair more frizzy).. suggestions for this are much appreciated too! \n\n\\- My hair is usually type 2a immediately after washing (based on my understanding anyway, please see pics), but by day 2 to 3, my waves are much less defined and the frizz takes over.\n\nAll that being said, what suggestions do you all have to combat frizz and help my waves last longer between washes (products, hair care ideas, etc)? Is there anything I am doing that may be impacting my results?\n\nPics show my hair the day I washed it and then day 2-5 hair\n\nThanks in advance !!\n\nAdditional info: I tried to add links from amazon for the scalp massager, brush, and silk bonnet, but my post was automatically removed due to issues with the link- I’ll try to link in the comments if the sub allows me to.",

      "content": "My skin has gotten this really weird rash that makes my pores red and inflamed, and sometimes pustules will show up. They are super easy to pop and I think might be leaving scars??\n\nMy skin is only getting worse as time goes on. I have phased out almost all my products except Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser and my Tower 28 Redness Cream and just added in Paula’s Choice Azelaic Acid 3x a week, and have been for about 2 weeks now to reduce the redness.\n\nI have sensitive skin as well, and the products I am using have always worked for me tbh. I have been using Cerave and Tower 28 for years with no issues, and\n\nThe little pimples are now spreading down and across my cheeks and I honestly don’t even know what do to anymore. I thought it was fungal acne at first because it did itch sometimes so I switched to Nizerol and a gel cream for 2 and a half weeks and saw no improvement at all, my skin was just even more red and raw. I also have KP on my arms and legs so I thought it could be KP, but at this point I don’t even know. Does anyone else have any issues like this with their skin and if so what has helped it?\n\nThe last picture is my baseline skin, when I was using way more products I.e Paula’s choice BHA toner, Rhode Barrier Butter. After noticing the small pimples on my cheeks I phased out every product I have been using to try to see what was causing my issue, with no avail :(",
