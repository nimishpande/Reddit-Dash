I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

My wash days aren’t turning out great (frizzy, wonky curls) and then seemingly as soon as I leave my apartment they go limp and stringy. The first picture is from this afternoon after washing and styling last night. The second picture is from a while ago but is more how my hair used to look. \n\nMy hair is long, fine, medium density, and I think low porosity, so it’s easily weighed down. I’ve always struggled with hold but not usually to this extent. I live in Canada so I think the dry winter might be part of it, but it hasn’t been this bad in the past. \n\nCurrent routine:\n\nWash with Pantene volume shampoo\n\nCondition with a small amount of pattern detangling nectar or herbal essences nourishing detangling spray\n\nScrunch out excess water\n\nApply Harry’s gel in sections and brush style\n\nHover diffuse (don’t usually pixie diffuse as I find it gives me wonky curls)\n\nSilk scarf to sleep\n\nI recently changed gels because I felt like my usual got2b gel was drying out my hair in the winter, so I switched to Giovanni LA hold, which made my hair feel even drier and had pretty weak hold, so I switched to Harry’s which gives a good cast but once I scrunch it out it’s like I have no hold. \n\nI’ve also been experimenting with different conditioners since my hair has been staticky (so I assume dry?), but they all just seem to make my hair even more limp. \n\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated, I’m at my wit’s end and my straightener is beckoning to me.

Pineappling gives me flat roots and weird kinks at the ponytail line, silk scarves slide off my head within an hour of falling asleep (even the ones with ties, idk how), braids leave me with a texture that looks nothing like my actual curl pattern.\n\nI've been doing a loose gather at the crown into a satin bonnet and it's the first method that doesn't completely destroy my definition by morning, though I did have to try like four different bonnets before finding one that actually stays on my head. The one from kitsch has been good, double layered and doesn't slide around.\n\naaand this is my wash day routine for context: I cleanse with the kitsch rice water bar, condition with mielle pomegranate and honey, scrunch in aussie instant freeze while soaking wet, diffuse to maybe 80% dry then air dry the rest. Sleep with fully dry hair only, that's been key... wet or even damp hair in a bonnet is a frizz disaster waiting to happen. Morning refresh is just a light water mist and scrunching, sometimes a tiny bit more kinky curly gel if things are really flat.",

She was once like \"why did you cut your hair?\" This is putting pressure on me and I honestly don't think I could be with someone who prioritises physical features. Not saying she's like that but she puts a lot of emphasis on male grooming and hair being neat.\n\nAnother girl at work (27) commented about a guy who is balding and said she doesn't like that he cut his hair cause now he looks ugly and in my mind I was like \"He had no choice he is balding\".\n\nI hate how the younger generation just concentrates on things that are not super important like physical appearance and it just makes me feel even more insecure cause I'm balding myself.

I use Tretinoin and from the research I did online, it seemed like a good cream to keep your face moisturized when using Tretinoin. I have been using it for well over a year but have had a sneaking suspicion that the little whiteheads that I can basically scrape off gently are caused by the Illiyoon cream. I stopped using this cream and used Tret with only the Isntree gel cream, which I’m learning may not be enough moisture for Tretinoin, especially in combination with the harsher winter air. I’ve since taken a break from Tretinoin and have only been using the Isntree, but my skin feels tight/dry when it is typically oily/combo. I’ve attached a picture of my skin (wrinkling my forehead) if that helps y’all determine if my skin is dehydrated it or not. I ordered the Aestura Ato Barrier 365 Cream and it should arrive tomorrow. I’m hoping it won’t break me out and will bring my skin back to its normal state, but wanted to ask for other suggestions, especially from people who use Tretinoin and/or have broken out from the Illiyoon cream. Thanks very much in advance!\n\nMy routine (which I’m currently workshopping 🤪):\n\nAM: Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser, Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream, Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream, Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel (SPF)\n\nPM: Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil, same Cerave cleanser as AM, Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream, Tretinoin .025% (every other night) Gel, Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream",

My hair is a frizzy mess and tangles galore, so if anyone can recommend some products, something not too heavy and techniques to help my curls?

I’ve been a long time lurker on this sub and have done my fair share of research on finasteride. I’ve always been a little scared to try it but now I’m going to give it a go at a smaller dose to see if I can tolerate it. \n\nI spoke to my dermatologist about hair loss options and he suggested I first try oral minoxidil for 2-3 months before starting finasteride. His rationale was that if oral minoxidil leads to good gains then we can hold off on finasteride for a little longer. I was a little confused by this because the two medications are completely different mechanisms of treatment. I’ve done topical minoxidil for over 10 years now and the results have started to wane. The point of trying oral minoxidil was to see if it could help me more than topical is at the moment. Obviously not being on a DHT blocker all these years has led to a lot more loss.\n\nIs what my derm saying sound? I know there are plenty of people who take both oral minoxidil and finasteride at the same time. ",
