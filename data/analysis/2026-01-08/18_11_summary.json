      "content": "For context, I am a teacher so I have a few months off in the summer. I have another job during the summer but I take a 2 week break and go to Thailand and get all my beauty stuff done that I can’t afford in the States. \n\nFor example: \n\n20 inch hand tied hair extensions:\n\nUS: $1000+\nThailand: $150\n\nPermanent hair straightening:\n\nUS: $300+\nThailand: $30\n\n2 Veneers: \n\nUS: $3000\nThailand: $800\n\nLaser hair removal: \n\nUS: $2000\nThailand: $300\n\nGel mani pedi:\n\nUS: $100\nThailand: $10\n\n1 hour massage: \n\nUS: $80\nThailand: $7\n\nMedical exams including 2 X-Rays (I hadn’t met my deductible):\n\nUS: $3000\nThailand: $140\n\nI also go to the pharmacy and get my expensive prescriptions filled there for like 90% off. \n\n\nThe flights cost about $1200 round trip unless I have points from my credit card which makes them free. Even with the flights, I end up saving so much money. I understand I have more time off than most workers, but I could squeeze all this into a week if necessary. Also the hotels are affordable too, I was staying in a decent one by the beach for $10/night and 4 star hotels are like $50 if you want to treat yourself. \n\nAnyone else do this? I would never be able to afford any of this back in the States on a teacher salary. It takes a bit of finesse but I am an experienced traveler and found it easy to find and book appointments. If anyone has any tips they can share or other closer destinations, please share! \n\n\n",

After drying my waves had more definition than usual,  no cast and decent volume.\n\nThe spray has this tacky/sticky texture when she applied it to my damp hair which I’ve not come across before and I’m wondering what kind of product it was as it clearly gave hold and good definition. I think it had heat protectant in it too. Would anyone know what this is?\n\n  \nMy usual routine is the joico volumising shampoo and conditioner, Umberto gianni curl jelly shine, bed head smalltalk volumisier, lightly watered down eco gel and a heat protectant before diffusing.  (all styling product as applied sparingly by raking and I shape my waves with my fingers as I have the occasional ringlet) (I’m aware that I’m probably also weighing my hair down with most of these products but ill change to light weight ones after they run out!)\n\nthe photos are my my end of the day hair with the mystery product (ignore the fringe i was trying something new) vs my usual end of day hair ",

This dermatologist broke a lot of it down only after I'd purchased the supplement. Please view the risks like pregnancy, liver concerns and light sensitivity. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/e57E2n-S6NQ?\nsi=BK4FcJnbWI8EsiE_\n\nIt just feels a bit gimmicky like \"don't do Accutane buy our vitamin a supplement instead.\" It's a shame I really loved their skincare especially their gel moisturizer that's non pore clogging. I use their ingredients checker a lot in addition to other databases. \n\nAl Trump Videos:\nI read inklings the cofounder Danielle is MAGA and I figured maybe she's just MAHA and conservative (which is fine, I don't have to 100% agree with every business) but she's commenting on Al videos of Trump beating up Maduro? (Yes I know many Venezuelans are relieved to not live under Maduro anymore) but this seems like a weird things to post on your business account.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

It leaves my hair in giant matts and takes me 30 minutes to untangle in the shower. I’ve looked at the ingredients but they’re not especially bad, but not perfect.\n\nI then use a leave in conditioner spray, cantu curl cream, shockwave’s mousse, (heat protectant, I use a hair dryer with diffuser) and then either John frida frizz ease on my ends or a hair oil. \n\nMy hair is SO dry and frizzy. Though I use to bleach and colour (stopped as of a year). I think my hair is low porosity as it takes ages for water to take. I also think it’s become really weighed down as it now looks more wavy than curly.\n\nI’ve been trying to research products especially shampoo and conditioner but everything recommended I find is extremely expensive which won’t be manageable in the long run. I’m extremely overwhelmed, does anyone have any insight into affordable options?",

They only make my hair super dry after wash and without styling and using the leave-in or cream, they became so frizzy, dry and almost looking like straws. My hair was never like that before, I know that because I used to be able to survive with just the Sheamoisture Deep Hydration shampoo (the manuka honey one) &amp; without conditioner my hair will still be wayyyyyy healthier looking than my current hair after using my current shampoo AND conditioner  \n\nDoes anyone have good recommendations for shampoo &amp; conditioner that won't dry your hair out, able to give the moisture that your hair needs, and not be too heavy? \n\nThe reason why I stopped using the Sheamoisture shampoo was I realized it couldn't deal with the build-up on my scalp and I wanted a shampoo that can clarify a little better \n\nI personally find that the Maui Moisture lightweight hydration conditioner make it worse and my hair tangles into knots more than ever nowadays 🥲 \n\nDoes anyone know any good shampoo and conditioner for curly hair that's dry? \n\nOh and any hair oils too that's not too thick and heavy for curly hair? I used to use 100% pure argan oil which worked amazing on my hair but can be quite smelly as it just smells like the oil 😂   the other hair oils I've tried are mostly drugstore brands and not specifically for curly hair and usually have silicones &amp; end up building up on my hair more \n\nThank you so much in advance 🙇🏻‍♀️\n\n",

      "content": "\nHey guys! I have been experimenting with sunscreens for the last few months and here’s a review on them. I would like alternatives to the current ones that target pigmentation and help with skin brightening.\n\nOily-combination skin. Medium complexion. Slightly tanned from sports. Weather not too humid.\n\n1. Eucerin Pigment Control Spf 50+ - Protection seems great. Not sure if its water and sweat proof. Problem is it makes my skin look dull and tanned( lot of people asked me whether I’ve gotten tanned). Loved the product but unfortunately, may have to find a replacement coz of the dull, tanned look post application. WNRP.\n\n2. Reequil ultra matte dry touch gel- Good sunscreen but it doesn’t have any ingredients targeting skin brightening or pigmentation. I would prefer a sunscreen with the above mentioned. Works well for oily skin, no issues there. WRP if I just need protection but for daily use, would prefer a sunscreen with more functionality.\n\n3. Isntree hyaluronic acid sunscreen- Easy skip for oily skin. Face shines a lot post application. Had to discard the previous product so WNRP.\n\nI need help choosing a sunscreen that helps with pigmentation and skin brightening and also has adequate protection (spf50+). Oily-combo skin. Budget is not really a concern. Please suggest some that could be of help. Indian, European, Korean etc any of them(hopefully they work for me fingers crossed). Thanks for your time!\n\n",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi guys, I’m 22 and a girl. I’ve always had fine hair but last year due to improper care+box dye+bad hair mousses+dry shampoo, I’ve had quite a bit of hair fall, mostly noticeable at the front. I’m assuming (atleast hoping) this is temporary hair loss. I was wondering if anyone has tried minoxidil for temporary loss, used it for a few months then stopped. I know you have to keep using minoxidil if you have alopecia, but does the same apply for temporary hair loss? I’m just wondering if all my new hair will still fall out after minoxidil. \n\nAnother question, from your experience, if you apply 5% liquid minoxidil 1 ml, in the evening, with an eyeshadow brush or q tip, would your hair still look greasy? Especially the next day? I already have very greasy hair, cannot go more than 2 days without washing it, I’m worried minoxidil will make it even greasier. I can’t get the foam as it’s 4x more expensive in my country for some reason.\n\nOne last question is, currently I’m using 1.5mm derma stamp every 3 weeks, followed by rosemary oil after a day. I know research behind rosemary oil is a bit shady, but I’m wondering if this routine has worked for anyone else?\n\nAny advice is appreciated, thanks! ",
