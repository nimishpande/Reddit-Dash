      "content": "For context, I am a teacher so I have a few months off in the summer. I have another job during the summer but I take a 2 week break and go to Thailand and get all my beauty stuff done that I can’t afford in the States. \n\nFor example: \n\n20 inch hand tied hair extensions:\n\nUS: $1000+\nThailand: $150\n\nPermanent hair straightening:\n\nUS: $300+\nThailand: $30\n\n2 Veneers: \n\nUS: $3000\nThailand: $800\n\nLaser hair removal: \n\nUS: $2000\nThailand: $300\n\nGel mani pedi:\n\nUS: $100\nThailand: $10\n\n1 hour massage: \n\nUS: $80\nThailand: $7\n\nMedical exams including 2 X-Rays (I hadn’t met my deductible):\n\nUS: $3000\nThailand: $140\n\nI also go to the pharmacy and get my expensive prescriptions filled there for like 90% off. \n\n\nThe flights cost about $1200 round trip unless I have points from my credit card which makes them free. Even with the flights, I end up saving so much money. I understand I have more time off than most workers, but I could squeeze all this into a week if necessary. Also the hotels are affordable too, I was staying in a decent one by the beach for $10/night and 4 star hotels are like $50 if you want to treat yourself. \n\nAnyone else do this? I would never be able to afford any of this back in the States on a teacher salary. It takes a bit of finesse but I am an experienced traveler and found it easy to find and book appointments. If anyone has any tips they can share or other closer destinations, please share! \n\n\n",

When I was 25 I started using the minoxidil foam (usually Kirkland brand), but still felt like I was losing the battle. In the Fall of 2018 I finally decided to go on finasteride. This first pic was taken right before I started it. I only took one other progress pic about a month in because honestly, it just started to do its job and I simply stopped worrying about hair loss. Over 7 years later and I'm still very satisfied. I'm a still a little thin in the corwn area, but honestly I attribute that to being very inconsistent with my dosage. I'm on the 1mg HIMS brand now, and probably forget to take it at least 2-3 days per week. If I could back to daily I believe the crown will fill back out.\n\nI'm lucky in the sense that my problems were the crown and top area and not receding hairline. Point is if you stay the course you'll see some good results. ",

After drying my waves had more definition than usual,  no cast and decent volume.\n\nThe spray has this tacky/sticky texture when she applied it to my damp hair which I’ve not come across before and I’m wondering what kind of product it was as it clearly gave hold and good definition. I think it had heat protectant in it too. Would anyone know what this is?\n\n  \nMy usual routine is the joico volumising shampoo and conditioner, Umberto gianni curl jelly shine, bed head smalltalk volumisier, lightly watered down eco gel and a heat protectant before diffusing.  (all styling product as applied sparingly by raking and I shape my waves with my fingers as I have the occasional ringlet) (I’m aware that I’m probably also weighing my hair down with most of these products but ill change to light weight ones after they run out!)\n\nthe photos are my my end of the day hair with the mystery product (ignore the fringe i was trying something new) vs my usual end of day hair ",

I pushed it on top but nothing came out, so I opened it and checked if idk there’s some other hidden mechanism and then I reattached it but now it’s not coming from the hole as it’s supposed to but it comes from the sides of the bottle. What should I do? How do I fix it?\n\nAlso the saleswoman didn’t give me a step by step routine so I’d appreciate if any one could guide me through this cuz I’m not very skilled at skincare. She did give me goodies like an spf50+ ultra light fluid and and oil control sun gel cream. I’m assuming they’re just sunscreens? For daytime?\n\nSo yeah any advice and tips would be very helpful.",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI was prescribed Tret almost 2 years ago for closed comedomes. I started 1x/week as recommended and slowly was able to build up my tolerance to every 3rd day with the sandwich method. I purged for 3 months and at that point around 80% of my comedomes had cleared. Unfortunately since then, although my skin is improved, the tret has never fully cleared my comedomes from forming (likely hormonal - this all started for me after stopping birth control). The tret \\~50% of the time is able to purge the comedome into either a white head or cystic pimple, however there seems to be to some level active zits at all times around my chin and jawline. I also struggle pretty extensively with PIE following the comedomes coming to a head after using the tret, and haven’t had success with azelaic acid for that.\n\nOver the years I’ve never successfully been able to increase to more frequent use, and unfortunately I end up having to cut back on frequency short term quite often (especially winter time) due to persistent peeling and some minor irritation. I have also tried decreasing the tret frequency and adding in gentle acids like mandelic acid or azelaic acid to see if this helps keep my skin clear, but it always ends up being too irritating so I resort back to just using tret. I’ve tried both adapalene (increased my closed comedomes after a month use so I panicked and switched back to tret) and aklief (constant peeling) with no success.\n\nWith it being the depth of winter and my peeling being out of control, I’m only able to use tret ever 4-5 days. I guess at this point I’m wondering if I might have more success switching to an OTC retinaldehyde with the goal of being able to increase frequency of use to keep the comedomes at bay. It’s not clear to me on whether using a stronger retinoid like tret less frequently or a gentler OTC retinal more frequently would be better suited for my situation. I’m nervous to switch off of tret given that it has helped compared to where I was at 2 years ago and I don’t want to take a step back, but I’ve had little improvement since then.\n\nI have very dry, acne prone, sensitive skin as an FYI.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much and sorry for such a long post.",

      "content": "\nHey guys! I have been experimenting with sunscreens for the last few months and here’s a review on them. I would like alternatives to the current ones that target pigmentation and help with skin brightening.\n\nOily-combination skin. Medium complexion. Slightly tanned from sports. Weather not too humid.\n\n1. Eucerin Pigment Control Spf 50+ - Protection seems great. Not sure if its water and sweat proof. Problem is it makes my skin look dull and tanned( lot of people asked me whether I’ve gotten tanned). Loved the product but unfortunately, may have to find a replacement coz of the dull, tanned look post application. WNRP.\n\n2. Reequil ultra matte dry touch gel- Good sunscreen but it doesn’t have any ingredients targeting skin brightening or pigmentation. I would prefer a sunscreen with the above mentioned. Works well for oily skin, no issues there. WRP if I just need protection but for daily use, would prefer a sunscreen with more functionality.\n\n3. Isntree hyaluronic acid sunscreen- Easy skip for oily skin. Face shines a lot post application. Had to discard the previous product so WNRP.\n\nI need help choosing a sunscreen that helps with pigmentation and skin brightening and also has adequate protection (spf50+). Oily-combo skin. Budget is not really a concern. Please suggest some that could be of help. Indian, European, Korean etc any of them(hopefully they work for me fingers crossed). Thanks for your time!\n\n",

They only make my hair super dry after wash and without styling and using the leave-in or cream, they became so frizzy, dry and almost looking like straws. My hair was never like that before, I know that because I used to be able to survive with just the Sheamoisture Deep Hydration shampoo (the manuka honey one) &amp; without conditioner my hair will still be wayyyyyy healthier looking than my current hair after using my current shampoo AND conditioner  \n\nDoes anyone have good recommendations for shampoo &amp; conditioner that won't dry your hair out, able to give the moisture that your hair needs, and not be too heavy? \n\nThe reason why I stopped using the Sheamoisture shampoo was I realized it couldn't deal with the build-up on my scalp and I wanted a shampoo that can clarify a little better \n\nI personally find that the Maui Moisture lightweight hydration conditioner make it worse and my hair tangles into knots more than ever nowadays 🥲 \n\nOh and any hair oils too that's not too thick and heavy for curly hair? I used to use 100% pure argan oil which worked amazing on my hair but can be quite smelly as it just smells like the oil 😂   the other hair oils I've tried are mostly drugstore brands and not specifically for curly hair and usually have silicones &amp; end up building up on my hair more \n\nThank you so much in advance 🙇🏻‍♀️\n\n",

      "content": "I am 22 years old, turning 23 this year. I’ve had a skincare routine since I was 17, and I started using retinol when I was 19.\n\nThis expression line on my forehead is bothering me a lot. In daily life, it is practically imperceptible, but under a camera flash or with zoom, it becomes very visible.\n\nI was previously using 0.3% retinol once a week and glycolic acid once a week. I recently increased the retinol usage to twice a week because I felt the frequency might have been too low.\n\nI know that aging is natural, but I am seriously considering investing in Botox. I am aware that I’m still relatively young and that this might be a premature decision.\nI’ve attached photos of my face up close with a flash and in natural light (please ignore the breakouts, it's a hormonal period).",

I’m having so many issues with persistent hair residue build up— it’s literally not on my scalp or my ends but the hair that’s closest to my roots; about an inch from my roots in few places there’s ALWAYS remaining residue. I’ll attach a photo to show where exactly I’m talking about and for reference, I have dry skin and dry hair so this “oily waxy” kind of residue doesn’t make sense.\n\nI bought a stronger shower head. Used a brush to disperse the conditioner evenly. Used clarifying shampoos. Double shampooe’d. Have a shower filter (although it may need to be replaced). I’m making sure the water gets all the crevices of my hair and thoroughly clean it. I’ve tried an array of different shampoo and conditioners— I just bought silicone and sulfate free and STILL there’s residue. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong and I’m just getting SO frustrated!\n\nI’m unsure where this build up is even coming from because at this point, I’m not even using additional products. If I am to use any oils, it’s ONLY at my ends.\n\nI’ve showered dozens of times diagnosing the problem doing trial and error and nothing is solving it 😂 it’s becoming a huge sensory issue to me.\n\nWhat would fix this?! Would the OUAI detox shampoo work? Is it hard water? (Live in California so there’s a moderate amount of hard water where I’m from)\n\nTIA for answers!",

      "content": "Has anyone tried mixing a emulsifying cleansing oil with albolene or adding it on after you've melted all your makeup to help remove the albolene easier? Will a cleansing oil/balm get the albolene to emulsify?\n\n\nCurrently using a cleansing oil. It has a thinner texture and I like it but I would like something thicker and more cushy feeling for makeup removal. I don't really wear makeup out often but I like putting it on for fun so typically whenever I am removing makeup I'm removing a FULL beat.   \nI prefer a cushy feeling cleansing oil or balm for removing makeup because I my skin is super sensitive to rubbing so a thick cushy oil helps pad my skin. I don't want to buy another cleansing oil right now especially since I'm not regularly removing makeup. Albolene is cheap and I've heard mineral oil breaks down makeup really well so I figured it might be a good option for me right now. \n\n\nI can't wipe it off with a towel or cotton pad because that has a high chance of irritating my skin. I have yet to find large cotton pads that are soft enough. Recs for super soft cotton pads, makeup wipes, baby wipes, or disposable face towels that can be found at Walmart/target would be appreciated too. \n\n\nAlso any tips on adding some sort of emulsifier to albolene? Like which one and where to buy.\n\n\nThank you for reading &lt;3",

I wanted more so I stopped taking finasteride and started taking only cheap Indian brand oral minoxidil and dutasteride from India mart. It had never looked worse after about 11 months, so I stopped all that and started taking legit 2.5mg oral minoxidil, 0.5mg dutasteride, and 1mg finasteride daily. After about 3 months the hair actually looked extremely good but within the last 2 weeks lots of hair is falling out and looks shit. I think for some reason dutasteride is doing more bad than good. I think just oral minoxidil and finasteride will work best. Can I also take 5mg finasteride instead of just 1mg finasteride?",
