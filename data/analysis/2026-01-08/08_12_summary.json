She also has sensory problems and won’t let me blow her hair dry and getting a brush through her hair twice a day is about the max she’ll allow. Cutting her hair has caused panic attacks, so we’ve resigned to keeping it long for now. \n\nCurrently, she typically showers at night, and (by her request) she’s using Function of Beauty wavy hair shampoo and conditioner. We’ve tried others, but this one seems to be the best of the ones we’ve tried. She loves her waves. We’ve tried a few different products like curl cream and mouse but they make her hair greasier even faster. She sleeps with it wet. We’ve tried bonnets, they’re hit or miss. Often they fall off overnight. \n\nI know it’s not good to wash hair every day, and she’s not yet at the point of daily showers anyway, but it seems to need to be washed every day! \n\nI’ve tried dry shampoo (so many kinds) and she hates it and I don’t notice much of a difference. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? I just want her to feel confident and good about herself - and she’s okay for now, but I worry about the future and middle school is looming…\n\nThank you in advance! ",

      "content": "So, you're probably wondering why I'm so late to the party on this one.. well after over a decade of struggling and straightening and fighting my curls I have finally (with the help of youtube) come back around to wearing my hair curly. It's going pretty well now and I think I have a routine down... or so I thought... \n\nI am trying to reduce my \"goo collection\" and dug out this gem (Citre shine making waves curl booster, see pic) from back in the day. I've sort of known for a while that these products were discontinued, but I had long moved on and so it didn't really bother me. But this week I decided to use this in my routine just so I could use it up and get it out of my closet and lo and behold I LOVE THE RESULTS!!! My curls are very tight on top/front compared to the bottom half of my head and the softness/loosness of this hold somehow makes everything look even and the finish feels sooo clean like i don't even feel like i have product in my hair except it looks great and not frizzy like it would if i really had no product in. \n\nNow I'm panicking because I stumbled upon a product that I actually love and it's been discontinued for over a decade. \n\nAdditional note: It is truly remarkable that the product has maintained it's original chemistry. Other ancient products I've tried to use up recently have come out of the tube completely separated or discolored and have clearly gone bad. But this citre shine product is preserved perfectly, as if I bought it yesterday. Their chemists deserve recognition for that time defying feat.",

      "title": "Can you help? Toddler wavy hair",
      "content": "My almost 4 year old daughter has very fine, wavy hair. Probably 2a/2b ish, if that matters. I have tried Facebook groups looking for help, but I get told it's not curly not wavy and not straight so I don't even know where to go at this point.\n\nI will include our routine but also key things that we have problems with. She had mixed threshold SPD. We are awaiting an ASD diagnosis. She likely has ADHD as well but that diagnosis will probably not happen until she's in kindergarten. Our biggest challenge is the sensory issues. She does not tolerate protective styling, especially at bed time. She will take ponytails and pigtails out during the day, even softer scrunchies, after a couple hours. She won't sleep on a pillow (so no pillowcase), she won't sleep on satin sheets. To braid her hair you would have to physically hold her down, which I won't do. She will \"let\" me brush her hair, but she screams and cries and pulls away the entire time, no matter how gentle I am or what steps I take.\n\nHer routine:\n\nWash/condition 1-2 x a week with eco chic kids.\nBrush hair while wet, usually while still in the tub, with a wet brush. Always starting from the bottom, always holding above the section or tangle I am working on so that it won't pull. I think she screams and cries sometimes more in anticipation of pain, or discomfort with the sensation, then because it hurts.\n\nWe just started putting a satin bonnet on her. She is excited about it. The problems we have are getting her hair into the bonnet, and keeping the bonnet on her head through the night. I have a child's size bonnet (she is a 98th percent head circumference so we have to go with one meant for 5+), it seems to fit well. The ties cross in the back and tie across the top of the forehead. We have tried putting it in a pineapple with a satin scrunchie, and then under the bonnet. But she will pull off the bonnet to take out the pineapple because she doesn't like the feeling. When we have managed to get her hair into the bonnet without the pineapple, eventually it falls off in the middle of the night. If I tie it tighter she doesn't like how that feels, and takes it off, or the tied portion slips up over the top of her head because of the tension.\n\nWhen she wakes up I use a continuous misting spray bottle that has mostly water and a small squirt of conditioner (I'm not positive which conditioner this one is, but I know it's just a regular conditioner). I get her hair very wet (wet enough that she complains that her hair/neck/shirt/whatever is wet). I brush it using a wet brush, often using it vertically, from the bottom up, holding above the section or tangle. Her hair is maybe to her shoulders when it's soaking wet and pulled straight. When it drives it comes to just below her chin/neck area. \n\nWe don't use any other product in her hair. No heat or styling implements like soft curlers or anything. Just what I have listed, my hands, the air, a wet brush, and her towel (we don't have any specific ones we use). Her hair is dry when we put it in the bonnet. As often as I can, or as often as she will tolerate, I will pull her hair back/up, because even in the car against the car seat it will become frizzy/start tangling. The pillowcase and sheat thing is out until/unless she can start tolerating that sensation, and I won't be able to put it in a braid unless she starts tolerating that. So I'm looking for shampoo, conditioner, or product recommendations (if that recommendation is no product, that's fine too). Types of brushes or combs. Techniques for brushing and combing. Types of hair bonnets or night scarves, ways to put it on and get it to stay on. If I am drying her hair correctly. \n\nAlso, she has had probably a dozen or more haircuts. We get it cut at the salon every 6-8 weeks, or sooner if we are noticing more issues. \n\nShe has a swirl pattern/hair whorl with no real natural part (although as her hair has gotten longer, it will now lay more evenly). \n\nWhen she was around a year or 18 months old, we had the stylist cut off an entire section of her hair. It was extremely frayed, frizzy, much coarser than the rest of her hair and nothing I was doing worked at the time. What grew back was much finer, but still frizzy and tangled prone with a wavy pattern.\n\nI know this is very long and points about her different sensory issues or needs may get lost in the shuffle. I'm just a mom who has 1b or 1c hair that still manages to get frizzy, who hated her hair growing up, who wants to take care of my daughter's hair as best I can, so that she feels proud and confident with it.\n\nEven if at the end of the day her waves are still baby curls after all the haircuts (and maybe they are, I'm no expert), it's the hair she has right now and I want to take care of it. \n\nETA: it is medium density (I think, I will have to double check, it could low density), fine, and the quiz says mixed porosity (it is past her shoulders and no heat, chemical or sun damage). I live in Ohio so currently it is dry out. The humidity in the summer definitely makes her waves/curls tighter and more defined.",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I usually do two different \"styles\" with my hair but they feel inconsistent to me. I don't really put much product in it unless I'm washing it. For the messy looking style I literally just get my hair wet and go back and fourth with a towel. My frustration is with the combed style. I feel like my hair just does whatever the heck it wants. I really don't care for what my hair is doing in the first two pictures but I don't totally hate the third one. I just don't know how to make it stay throughout the day and consistently look like that. I'm really open on suggestions and I just want my hair to not look goofy. I'm pretty sure I have a somewhat sensitive scalp when it comes to product or I'm just doing something wrong. ",

      "title": "My hairstylist didn’t give me the hair service I asked for &amp; has been leaving me on seen. Should I file a partial chargeback?",
      "content": "The day after Christmas I got my hair done for a partial highlight service. Keep in mind I was out of town in a different state for the holidays, so I wasn’t planning on being there for long and I wanted to get my partial highlight color retouched because I’m going abroad next week and there are no salons where I live (it’s a small town).\n\nSo I did my research, found a hair salon that specializes in coloring textured hair from TikTok with great reviews and I reached out to the stylist with closest availability to my travel schedule. The first red flag was when I reached out asking which service I should book (I showed pictures of the dimension I was going for and how my hair looked now), they suggested a partial highlight service which was $220 (reasonable) but as after I asked for their availability they left me on seen.\n\nAgain, I was pretty desperate to get my hair done because there’s not a lot of stylists who specialize in hair like mine AND can color it without damaging, so I checked the salon website and saw he was available on the 26th and booked it. I just assumed he forgot to respond, so it wasn’t a big deal.\n\nWhen I got there he took a look at my hair, I told him how I just wanted to REFRESH my current highlights, touch up my roots a bit and give it some dimension. I mentioned how I box dyed my grown in roots six months ago and got a keratin treatment eight months ago, and he said he was going to go in with a balayage instead and that he’d “throw in” a k18 treatment. So I agreed, he’s the professional here plus I figured a balayage would look better than what he was intending to do. The total was supposed to be $170 after the $50 deposit for the $220 total, but it ended up being a whopping $465. I reckoned I should have asked for the price but I checked on the website and it showed that a balayage was only $60 more than partial highlights which was still reasonable to me considering the $50 deposit would be deducted anyway.\n\nSo, I paid for it and after two days of getting used to it and my family commenting that they did not see a difference in my hair, I reached out again asking for a touchup to tone my hair at least because it was looking VERY brassy. I also asked if my $50 deposit was applied to the $465 total since it was a different service that time, because when I checked on the website again it showed that $465 was the standard “balayage experience” price so it should have been less after the deposit total.\n\nFor starters, he said I would’ve actually owed $945 because he did a silk press and blow dry. However, I’ve had a silk press done before and all he did was blow dry my hair on very low heat and pressed my roots a bit…also on low heat (not exactly sufficient for a silk press on my hair type). So it wasn’t even the full silk press experience and I was not expecting to get charged for it since the “balayage experience” said it came with a blowout already, nor did he communicate that with me that it would’ve been an extra fee that he decided not to charge.\n\nFortunately, he offered to do a tone and silk press free of charge but he kept saying that I could not go more blonde. He said the look I wanted to achieve was not possible at all—but I kept trying to tell him that I was not trying to go lighter I only wanted to have my original highlights, the same color my hair ALREADY was, refreshed. And anyway, aren’t you supposed to tell the client what is and isn’t possible for their hair goal?? He then said he was available on the 6th of January. I mentioned to him twice before that saying I was only going to be there until the 4th of January. I asked if he had an earlier date to squeeze me in somehow, and he left me on seen AGAIN. \n\nHe still didn’t respond for 2-3 days after that. I tried reaching out to the owner of the salon since there wasn’t any direct customer support and she said that the stylists are independent contractors and that I would have to speak with him directly about it. So I did one last time and sent him a text yesterday asking for a partial refund instead. When I paid, I paid half on my credit card for rewards and the rest on debit. He split the payment for me so it wouldn’t have been such a hassle to reimburse me partially, which I think is fair since he still serviced me but didn’t meet my request.\n\nThat said, I’m wondering if I should file a chargeback because I’ve reached out to him four times so far and he’s either left me on seen or barely even met me halfway. What should I do?\n\nNow I also have to buy a toning shampoo to help with the brassiness. To be honest, I’m not saying the hair color he did is terrible in fact it’s tolerable but not for the price I paid. I shouldn’t have to second guess or “live with” my hair result when it could have easily been fixed or avoided by the stylist, and it only looks good because I can style it. Otherwise, my highlights are nonexistent with the color which is what I came in there for in the first place, and the overall color is just too warm. If I tone it now, I can at least accept it until I decide what to do next after my hair has had a break from the bleach.",

The replies to that post were very helpful and I wanted some help on choosing some alternate products or sticking to this routine.\n\n- Moisturizer: should I stick with the ponds or switch to minimalist b12 since I'm using niacinamide and need to protect my skin barrier?\n\n- Sunscreen: this is where I am facing the biggest confusion (so are others when I searched this sub lol), I initially decided to go with the regular minimalist spf 50 but then I found out it has retinol in it (seperate thread on that later, because that makes no sense) which is a big no no with the other actives I'm using so decided to switch to the light fluid one instead. I've also heard korean ones are good as well as reequil ultra dry matte but there's so many choices and not enough budget to go around so please help me choose one :\")\n\nI hope y'all can provide a overall verdict on my routine, I'm scared and excited to be starting this journey for the first time after decades of tanning and negligence of my skin \n\nSee you on the other side 🤎",
