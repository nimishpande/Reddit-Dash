      "content": "For context, I am a teacher so I have a few months off in the summer. I have another job during the summer but I take a 2 week break and go to Thailand and get all my beauty stuff done that I can’t afford in the States. \n\nFor example: \n\n20 inch hand tied hair extensions:\n\nUS: $1000+\nThailand: $150\n\nPermanent hair straightening:\n\nUS: $300+\nThailand: $30\n\n2 Veneers: \n\nUS: $3000\nThailand: $800\n\nLaser hair removal: \n\nUS: $2000\nThailand: $300\n\nGel mani pedi:\n\nUS: $100\nThailand: $10\n\n1 hour massage: \n\nUS: $80\nThailand: $7\n\nMedical exams including 2 X-Rays (I hadn’t met my deductible):\n\nUS: $3000\nThailand: $140\n\nI also go to the pharmacy and get my expensive prescriptions filled there for like 90% off. \n\n\nThe flights cost about $1200 round trip unless I have points from my credit card which makes them free. Even with the flights, I end up saving so much money. I understand I have more time off than most workers, but I could squeeze all this into a week if necessary. Also the hotels are affordable too, I was staying in a decent one by the beach for $10/night and 4 star hotels are like $50 if you want to treat yourself. \n\nAnyone else do this? I would never be able to afford any of this back in the States on a teacher salary. It takes a bit of finesse but I am an experienced traveler and found it easy to find and book appointments. If anyone has any tips they can share or other closer destinations, please share! \n\n\n",

Earlier in the week i got layers put back into my hair so my waves can ‘breathe’ and the hair stylist used this spray in my hair that she rubbed into her hands and scrunched my hair with before diffusing. After drying my waves had more definition than usual,  no cast and decent volume.\n\nThe spray has this tacky/sticky texture when she applied it to my damp hair which I’ve not come across before and I’m wondering what kind of product it was as it clearly gave hold and good definition. I think it had heat protectant in it too. Would anyone know what this is?\n\n  \nMy usual routine is the joico volumising shampoo and conditioner, Umberto gianni curl jelly shine, bed head smalltalk volumisier, lightly watered down eco gel and a heat protectant before diffusing.  (all styling product as applied sparingly by raking and I shape my waves with my fingers as I have the occasional ringlet) (I’m aware that I’m probably also weighing my hair down with most of these products but ill change to light weight ones after they run out!)\n\nthe photos are my my end of the day hair with the mystery product (ignore the fringe i was trying something new) vs my usual end of day hair ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Hi! 20F here and I've added a picture of my skin. I double cleanse once a day in the evening with Neutrogena face wash with 2% salicylic acid, and then use the sandwich method with Epiduo and CeraVe moisturiser with ceramides. I started using Epiduo every couple of days and gradually increased the frequency once I thought my skin was ready, but have historically had very sensitive skin.  \n  \nMy skin has good days and bad days, and Epiduo usually lessens the effect of a lot of my redness and spots, especially when I wake up in the morning. However lately with all the cold weather in the UK, the lower portion of my face around my mouth has been completely dry with flaky skin, while the rest of my face is oily. I've noticed that cutting chocolate out of my diet makes my skin a lot less inflamed, and I've bought spearmint tea that I saw recommended on here.  \n  \nI also bought La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume today to try and hopefully rebuild my skin barrier as that seems to be the problem causing the dryness. I'd really appreciate if someone could explain to me where I could fit that in my routine, or give any suggestions of what I could change about my current routine/products please?\n\nMy skin is really affecting my self-confidence, and I play quite a few gigs in a band where I'll often be wearing makeup to cover my skin, and getting quite sweaty. Other than that, I keep makeup to a minimum and wash my brushes often. I'm also aware that I need to drink a LOT more water. If anyone could help me out please I'd really appreciate the help! Thank you :)",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi guys, I’m 22 and a girl. I’ve always had fine hair but last year due to improper care+box dye+bad hair mousses+dry shampoo, I’ve had quite a bit of hair fall, mostly noticeable at the front. I’m assuming (atleast hoping) this is temporary hair loss. I was wondering if anyone has tried minoxidil for temporary loss, used it for a few months then stopped. I know you have to keep using minoxidil if you have alopecia, but does the same apply for temporary hair loss? I’m just wondering if all my new hair will still fall out after minoxidil. \n\nAnother question, from your experience, if you apply 5% liquid minoxidil 1 ml, in the evening, with an eyeshadow brush or q tip, would your hair still look greasy? Especially the next day? I already have very greasy hair, cannot go more than 2 days without washing it, I’m worried minoxidil will make it even greasier. I can’t get the foam as it’s 4x more expensive in my country for some reason.\n\nOne last question is, currently I’m using 1.5mm derma stamp every 3 weeks, followed by rosemary oil after a day. I know research behind rosemary oil is a bit shady, but I’m wondering if this routine has worked for anyone else?\n\nAny advice is appreciated, thanks! ",

      "content": "Hello! My skin has become extremely oily over the past few months. As a result, I’m experiencing way more breakouts now at 27 than I ever had. I’ve been using the same basic skincare routine for years and (before this) it’s worked great. To help with the oily skin I decided to switch from the Cerave hydrating cleanser to the foaming cleanser. I’m weary of changing my routine too much as I’ve had bad reactions to new products in the past. I’ve only used the cleanser once but I feel like I got a much better clean. But now I want to be sure that I can still keep my regular routine but just switch out the cleansers.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. I’ve never really experienced breakouts before so I’m feeling very ill equipped. Thanks!\n\nMorning:\n\n\\- Cerave cleanser (hydrating, now foaming)\n\n\\- Cerave moisturizer\n\n\\- Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n\\- Cerave cleanser (hydrating, now foaming)\n\n\\- The Ordinary hyaluronic acid\n\n\\- The Ordinary retinol 1%\n\n\\- Youth to the People superberry hydrate and glow dream mask",
