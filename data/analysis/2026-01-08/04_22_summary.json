The “herald patch” seen on my upper bum is not itchy, but is hard and scaly and appeared about two weeks before I was covered in its smaller, insanely itchy and aggressive little minions. I’ve also had headaches, sore legs, and fatigue.\n\nI’ve now been prescribed a steroid for the itching and can at least sleep in peace knowing this will resolve on its own eventually and is not contagious. I also plan on laying out in the sun in the middle of winter like a lunatic, but, anything that helps! 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I don’t recall having a virus before the initial patch appeared but I have been increasingly stressed at work. Right now I’m concerned about scarring and I honestly just can’t wait for the ugliness to go away 😭",

      "title": "Can you help? Toddler wavy hair",
      "content": "My almost 4 year old daughter has very fine, wavy hair. Probably 2a/2b ish, if that matters. I have tried Facebook groups looking for help, but I get told it's not curly not wavy and not straight so I don't even know where to go at this point.\n\nI will include our routine but also key things that we have problems with. She had mixed threshold SPD. We are awaiting an ASD diagnosis. She likely has ADHD as well but that diagnosis will probably not happen until she's in kindergarten. Our biggest challenge is the sensory issues. She does not tolerate protective styling, especially at bed time. She will take ponytails and pigtails out during the day, even softer scrunchies, after a couple hours. She won't sleep on a pillow (so no pillowcase), she won't sleep on satin sheets. To braid her hair you would have to physically hold her down, which I won't do. She will \"let\" me brush her hair, but she screams and cries and pulls away the entire time, no matter how gentle I am or what steps I take.\n\nHer routine:\n\nWash/condition 1-2 x a week with eco chic kids.\nBrush hair while wet, usually while still in the tub, with a wet brush. Always starting from the bottom, always holding above the section or tangle I am working on so that it won't pull. I think she screams and cries sometimes more in anticipation of pain, or discomfort with the sensation, then because it hurts.\n\nWe just started putting a satin bonnet on her. She is excited about it. The problems we have are getting her hair into the bonnet, and keeping the bonnet on her head through the night. I have a child's size bonnet (she is a 98th percent head circumference so we have to go with one meant for 5+), it seems to fit well. The ties cross in the back and tie across the top of the forehead. We have tried putting it in a pineapple with a satin scrunchie, and then under the bonnet. But she will pull off the bonnet to take out the pineapple because she doesn't like the feeling. When we have managed to get her hair into the bonnet without the pineapple, eventually it falls off in the middle of the night. If I tie it tighter she doesn't like how that feels, and takes it off, or the tied portion slips up over the top of her head because of the tension.\n\nWhen she wakes up I use a continuous misting spray bottle that has mostly water and a small squirt of conditioner (I'm not positive which conditioner this one is, but I know it's just a regular conditioner). I get her hair very wet (wet enough that she complains that her hair/neck/shirt/whatever is wet). I brush it using a wet brush, often using it vertically, from the bottom up, holding above the section or tangle. Her hair is maybe to her shoulders when it's soaking wet and pulled straight. When it drives it comes to just below her chin/neck area. \n\nWe don't use any other product in her hair. No heat or styling implements like soft curlers or anything. Just what I have listed, my hands, the air, a wet brush, and her towel (we don't have any specific ones we use). Her hair is dry when we put it in the bonnet. As often as I can, or as often as she will tolerate, I will pull her hair back/up, because even in the car against the car seat it will become frizzy/start tangling. The pillowcase and sheat thing is out until/unless she can start tolerating that sensation, and I won't be able to put it in a braid unless she starts tolerating that. So I'm looking for shampoo, conditioner, or product recommendations (if that recommendation is no product, that's fine too). Types of brushes or combs. Techniques for brushing and combing. Types of hair bonnets or night scarves, ways to put it on and get it to stay on. If I am drying her hair correctly. \n\nAlso, she has had probably a dozen or more haircuts. We get it cut at the salon every 6-8 weeks, or sooner if we are noticing more issues. \n\nShe has a swirl pattern/hair whorl with no real natural part (although as her hair has gotten longer, it will now lay more evenly). \n\nWhen she was around a year or 18 months old, we had the stylist cut off an entire section of her hair. It was extremely frayed, frizzy, much coarser than the rest of her hair and nothing I was doing worked at the time. What grew back was much finer, but still frizzy and tangled prone with a wavy pattern.\n\nI know this is very long and points about her different sensory issues or needs may get lost in the shuffle. I'm just a mom who has 1b or 1c hair that still manages to get frizzy, who hated her hair growing up, who wants to take care of my daughter's hair as best I can, so that she feels proud and confident with it.\n\nEven if at the end of the day her waves are still baby curls after all the haircuts (and maybe they are, I'm no expert), it's the hair she has right now and I want to take care of it. \n\nETA: it is medium density (I think, I will have to double check, it could low density), fine, and the quiz says mixed porosity (it is past her shoulders and no heat, chemical or sun damage). I live in Ohio so currently it is dry out. The humidity in the summer definitely makes her waves/curls tighter and more defined.",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I've also heard korean ones are good as well as reequil ultra dry matte but there's so many choices and not enough budget to go around so please help me choose one :\")\n\nI hope y'all can provide a overall verdict on my routine, I'm scared and excited to be starting this journey for the first time after decades of tanning and negligence of my skin \n\nSee you on the other side 🤎",

It's going pretty well now and I think I have a routine down... or so I thought... \n\nI am trying to reduce my \"goo collection\" and dug out this gem (Citre shine making waves curl booster, see pic) from back in the day. I've sort of known for a while that these products were discontinued, but I had long moved on and so it didn't really bother me. But this week I decided to use this in my routine just so I could use it up and get it out of my closet and lo and behold I LOVE THE RESULTS!!! My curls are very tight on top/front compared to the bottom half of my head and the softness/loosness of this hold somehow makes everything look even and the finish feels sooo clean like i don't even feel like i have product in my hair except it looks great and not frizzy like it would if i really had no product in. \n\nNow I'm panicking because I stumbled upon a product that I actually love and it's been discontinued for over a decade. \n\nAdditional note: It is truly remarkable that the product has maintained it's original chemistry. Other ancient products I've tried to use up recently have come out of the tube completely separated or discolored and have clearly gone bad. But this citre shine product is preserved perfectly, as if I bought it yesterday. Their chemists deserve recognition for that time defying feat.",

Picture 3, on the other hand, is of my hair from a few weeks ago; I had not been using the gel then, and you can see that the definition is overall worse, but I love how voluminous it looks compared to the first two images (I think it looks a little cuter, in-fact, but maybe I am wrong).

I've tried mousse but that makes my hair sticky(?) and I hate it. I've tried a couple cheap gels but havent found one that doesn't LOOK like I have gel in my hair. I like that I can usually easily refresh with gel though.\n\nIdk any suggestions for a product similar to Bryl cream or something? Tbh I don't do a whole lot with my hair and usually just try to control the frizz and let the curls do whatever they want ",

      "content": "Hi all, I'm suffering from I think aggressive hair loss, and want some advice/ next steps. A bit of context - I'm 23 years old currently and noticed my crown thinning around June/July 2023. I got on oral minoxidil 2.5mg in September 2023 and saw great results up until around July/August 2024. My hairline has always been a nw2 but I suffer from crown thinness. When my minoxidil results peaked, my crown 85/90 percent filled in. Then after July/August I saw more hair loss - and I thought it was a second shedding phase. \n\nThe increased hair loss did not stop and I started fin 1mg ED in November 2024. I was on Fin for around 11 months. I didn't see any improvement in hairloss and my crown area got thinner and thinner. In August 2025, I started 0.5mg dut ED (paired with 0.5mg fin for the first 2.5 months). This pic was taken right before I started dut. Note that in this pic my hair was freshly shampood and conditioned so appears to cover a bit more of my crown than it usually does. I have been on dut since then (nearing 5 months) now. \n\nI'm not sure if I've been through a shedding phase, but my hair is a worse than it was back then. I also cut my hair a bit short so not sure if that is adding to the less coverage. I have not seen any improvement on dut either. I can't tell if my hairloss has lessened, but I've definitely not had any regrowth and have definitely regressed in terms of crown dessity. It's really messing up my head right now.\n\nMy question is - what can I expect? Ideally I want to go to my minoxidil prime (you could tell my crown was thinning in harsh lighting, but had around 85/90 percent coverage otherwise). Is that possible? When do people usually see results from dut? I know 5 months is very soon to tell, but really need some motivation to keep going. Judging by my pre dut state (and assuming I can return to that state once the \"shed\" from dut is over) and my timeline of medication, what can my end results look like? Anyone has had any similar experiences? Just to summarise, my protocol currently is 0.5mg dut + minoxidil 2.5 mg ED and occasionally I dermastamp. Is there anything else I should look into? Any help/advice/similar experiences/timelines will be highly appreciated.",

No reaction, no breakouts.\n\nBUT I didn’t love the finish (a bit too shiny/gelly for my liking), so I thought I’d try others.\n\n\t•\tDot &amp; Key SPF &amp; Aqualogica SPF – BIG mistake. Both gave me dermatitis. Burning, irritation, texture — the whole nightmare. This really shook my confidence in cosmetic brands.\n\n\t•\tWent to a dermatologist:\n\n\t•\tSuggested Venusia sunscreen → made me extremely oily, felt heavy and uncomfortable and also i felt it didn’t work much i felt my tan increased with the use\n\n\t•\tThen suggested Acne UV.\n\n\t•\tAcne UV (50g) – LOVED it. Blended well, no irritation, skin was happy.\n\nSo I confidently bought the 100g version and… it was HORRIBLE.\n\nThick, doesn’t blend, terrible white cast, stays patchy on the skin. I don’t know if it’s a batch issue or formulation difference, but it was unusable.\n\n\t•\tUV Doux – Tried this too and it felt good on my skin. No immediate reaction.\n\n•\tBoj OG Sunscreen — Too heavy, felt like a moisturizing blanket for dry skin — not for me.\n\nNow I’m thinking: Korean sunscreens?\n\nI’ve seen people rave about them, but they’re costly, and I’m nervous because:\n\nI apply sunscreen properly (2–3 fingers) every day, so cost matters — but if something is truly worth it, I’m open to trying.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n\n\t•\tSafe for very sensitive skin\n\n\t•\tNo dermatitis / irritation\n\n\t•\tPrefer matte or comfortable, slight dew is okay\n\n\t•\tWorth the price for daily use\n\nIf you’ve had similar skin issues and found something that works (especially Korean or pharmacy sunscreens), please share 🙏\n\nI just want sun protection without my skin panicking .",

Hormonal Acne or Hive breakout?\n\nHi everyone, I have been struggling with acne for the past year and some change but it has gotten progressively worse, and these pics are current. In the winter, I have noticed it gets really bad steps I have taken to alleviate this by going to the dermatologist, putting a humidifier in my room, an air purifier also in my room. I’d also like to preferences by saying I am in my early 30s and I never used to have acne as a teen. I am now on an oral medication (spironolactone) and I was prescribed tretinoin however, my face is so angry. It hurts the bumps itch and it’s just really uncomfortable. The last time I went to the dermatologist was just a few days ago and she informed me that this acne is hormonal acne and I have a hard time believing that it’s hormonal acne however I could just be in severe denial, so I’m looking for some opinions and maybe some help on what I can do to alleviate some of the pain that I’m feeling due to how dry and irritated my skin is and just some overall ideas on what kind of acne this is and if this acne is looking like hormonal.

(I was using Monday Smooth shampoo and conditioner for curly and frizzy hair for the past 6 months and recently switched to Garnier Whole Blends Oat Delicacy shampoo and conditioner.)\n\n2. Soak up the extra water using a microfiber towel.\n\n3. Gently blow-dry while scrunching.\n\n4. Apply ORS Olive Oil hair lotion for moisture because I have super dry hair. Sometimes I apply the lotion before blow-drying. I initially bought this lotion as a leave-in conditioner because I read/heard somewhere that leave-in conditioners are the same as hair lotions and hair creams. \n\n5. Use satin scrunchies, put my curls into a pineapple, and sleep on a satin pillowcase.\n\nI only comb my hair with a wide-toothed sandalwood comb before showering. I never comb after washing or during styling because once I combed my hair while wet, then styled as usual, and ended up with thin, stringy curls.\n\nI don't like gel or mousse. Also, I've had significant hairfall over the past few years due to stress and lack of nutrition.\n\nSo now I have a few questions:\n\n1. I looked at curly hair type charts but they have different pictures of the same curl type so I cannot identify what curl pattern I have. What is my curl pattern?\n\n2. What am I doing wrong and what can I do better in my hair care routine? How can define my hair's natural curls without using too many products? ",
