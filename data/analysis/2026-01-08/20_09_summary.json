      "content": "For context, I am a teacher so I have a few months off in the summer. I have another job during the summer but I take a 2 week break and go to Thailand and get all my beauty stuff done that I can’t afford in the States. \n\nFor example: \n\n20 inch hand tied hair extensions:\n\nUS: $1000+\nThailand: $150\n\nPermanent hair straightening:\n\nUS: $300+\nThailand: $30\n\n2 Veneers: \n\nUS: $3000\nThailand: $800\n\nLaser hair removal: \n\nUS: $2000\nThailand: $300\n\nGel mani pedi:\n\nUS: $100\nThailand: $10\n\n1 hour massage: \n\nUS: $80\nThailand: $7\n\nMedical exams including 2 X-Rays (I hadn’t met my deductible):\n\nUS: $3000\nThailand: $140\n\nI also go to the pharmacy and get my expensive prescriptions filled there for like 90% off. \n\n\nThe flights cost about $1200 round trip unless I have points from my credit card which makes them free. Even with the flights, I end up saving so much money. I understand I have more time off than most workers, but I could squeeze all this into a week if necessary. Also the hotels are affordable too, I was staying in a decent one by the beach for $10/night and 4 star hotels are like $50 if you want to treat yourself. \n\nAnyone else do this? I would never be able to afford any of this back in the States on a teacher salary. It takes a bit of finesse but I am an experienced traveler and found it easy to find and book appointments. If anyone has any tips they can share or other closer destinations, please share! \n\n\n",

Earlier in the week i got layers put back into my hair so my waves can ‘breathe’ and the hair stylist used this spray in my hair that she rubbed into her hands and scrunched my hair with before diffusing. After drying my waves had more definition than usual,  no cast and decent volume.\n\nThe spray has this tacky/sticky texture when she applied it to my damp hair which I’ve not come across before and I’m wondering what kind of product it was as it clearly gave hold and good definition. I think it had heat protectant in it too. Would anyone know what this is?\n\n  \nMy usual routine is the joico volumising shampoo and conditioner, Umberto gianni curl jelly shine, bed head smalltalk volumisier, lightly watered down eco gel and a heat protectant before diffusing.  (all styling product as applied sparingly by raking and I shape my waves with my fingers as I have the occasional ringlet) (I’m aware that I’m probably also weighing my hair down with most of these products but ill change to light weight ones after they run out!)\n\nthe photos are my my end of the day hair with the mystery product (ignore the fringe i was trying something new) vs my usual end of day hair ",

      "content": "Hi friends,\nMy (26F) skin has really taken a turn for the worst in my adulthood and I just don’t know how to approach my skincare anymore. Up until about 23 y/o I always had flawless, clear skin and my pre-established skincare routine worked great for that.  However, I am now struggling with rosacea, hormonal acne due to PMDD, and my skin is drier than the Sahara no matter what I do. This post is inspired by my shower today, where after I washed my face my dry skin was literally peeling off in my hands :( \n\nI have simplified my routine a lot to try to figure out what works vs what doesn’t. \nCurrent routine:\n- I wash my face with CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser most days and PanOxyl when my acne is bad (only product that seems to help the acne, salicylic acid washes seem to do nothing; I have very small pores and when I get pimples they get very inflamed and painful). \n- AM/PM I use: \n• The Ordinary azelaic acid (which has done wonders for the rosacea!) \n• Medicube exosome cica cream (AM only)\n• CeraVe moisturizer. I often double moisturize which keeps my skin from being sandpaper for all of 8 hours. \n• When I’m not using the azelaic acid I use The Ordinary hyaluronic acid (using them both together causes weird pilling of the azelaic).\n• PM I use Cetaphil skin redness night moisturizer. \n\nI’ve been doing this for about 8 months which has helped a lot of my problems so I’ve been trepidatious to add anything else out of fear of making it worse again, but I’m still struggling with my skin in a lot of regards. \n\nAny tips, advice, product/routine recommendations would be greatly appreciated. I used to have my whole routine mapped out but I feel clueless with the condition of my “new” skin. \n\nTIA\n\n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

What should I do? How do I fix it?\n\nAlso the saleswoman didn’t give me a step by step routine so I’d appreciate if any one could guide me through this cuz I’m not very skilled at skincare. She did give me goodies like an spf50+ ultra light fluid and and oil control sun gel cream. I’m assuming they’re just sunscreens? For daytime?\n\nSo yeah any advice and tips would be very helpful.",

When I was 25 I started using the minoxidil foam (usually Kirkland brand), but still felt like I was losing the battle. In the Fall of 2018 I finally decided to go on finasteride. This first pic was taken right before I started it. I only took one other progress pic about a month in because honestly, it just started to do its job and I simply stopped worrying about hair loss. Over 7 years later and I'm still very satisfied. I'm a still a little thin in the corwn area, but honestly I attribute that to being very inconsistent with my dosage. I'm on the 1mg HIMS brand now, and probably forget to take it at least 2-3 days per week. If I could back to daily I believe the crown will fill back out.\n\nI'm lucky in the sense that my problems were the crown and top area and not receding hairline. Point is if you stay the course you'll see some good results. ",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I would like alternatives to the current ones that target pigmentation and help with skin brightening.\n\nOily-combination skin. Medium complexion. Slightly tanned from sports. Weather not too humid.\n\n1. Eucerin Pigment Control Spf 50+ - Protection seems great. Not sure if its water and sweat proof. Problem is it makes my skin look dull and tanned( lot of people asked me whether I’ve gotten tanned). Loved the product but unfortunately, may have to find a replacement coz of the dull, tanned look post application. WNRP.\n\n2. Reequil ultra matte dry touch gel- Good sunscreen but it doesn’t have any ingredients targeting skin brightening or pigmentation. I would prefer a sunscreen with the above mentioned. Works well for oily skin, no issues there. WRP if I just need protection but for daily use, would prefer a sunscreen with more functionality.\n\n3. Isntree hyaluronic acid sunscreen- Easy skip for oily skin. Face shines a lot post application. Had to discard the previous product so WNRP.\n\nI need help choosing a sunscreen that helps with pigmentation and skin brightening and also has adequate protection (spf50+). Oily-combo skin. Budget is not really a concern. Please suggest some that could be of help. Indian, European, Korean etc any of them(hopefully they work for me fingers crossed). Thanks for your time!\n\n",

I should mention I have long Covid and it can present as Sjogren's or trigger Sjogren's - which is very dry skin and eyes and joint pains. Over the last month, I've had two episodes like this. The first time I thought I was having an allergic reaction to Tamiflu. This second time, it's clear this is a bigger issue with severe breathing issues also. I'm going to be getting my whole autoimmune work up panel done. But meanwhile, the skin is INCREDIBLY dry...flaking off my face like dandruff. Hands and arms scaly dry. Hoping for recommendations for what and how to use products to calm this down. I used to use Cerave tub at night but for now I'm using HA acid with Avene Cicalfate on top, with a layer of vaseline on top at night. Of course none of this works for the day. Any help?",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

They only make my hair super dry after wash and without styling and using the leave-in or cream, they became so frizzy, dry and almost looking like straws. My hair was never like that before, I know that because I used to be able to survive with just the Sheamoisture Deep Hydration shampoo (the manuka honey one) &amp; without conditioner my hair will still be wayyyyyy healthier looking than my current hair after using my current shampoo AND conditioner  \n\nDoes anyone have good recommendations for shampoo &amp; conditioner that won't dry your hair out, able to give the moisture that your hair needs, and not be too heavy? \n\nThe reason why I stopped using the Sheamoisture shampoo was I realized it couldn't deal with the build-up on my scalp and I wanted a shampoo that can clarify a little better \n\nI personally find that the Maui Moisture lightweight hydration conditioner make it worse and my hair tangles into knots more than ever nowadays 🥲 \n\nOh and any hair oils too that's not too thick and heavy for curly hair? I used to use 100% pure argan oil which worked amazing on my hair but can be quite smelly as it just smells like the oil 😂   the other hair oils I've tried are mostly drugstore brands and not specifically for curly hair and usually have silicones &amp; end up building up on my hair more \n\nThank you so much in advance 🙇🏻‍♀️\n\n",

Still experimenting with The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA but I think it's causing the blind pimples.\n\nAny niacinamide products break me out like crazy, though for the last few years I've had no regular pimples, only the occasional deep set painful blind pimple next to my nose or my chin.

I’ve included both wet and dry pictures of my hair before and after bleaching and dyeing.",
