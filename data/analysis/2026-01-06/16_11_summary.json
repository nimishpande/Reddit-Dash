I use it after showering and I’m good for the entire day. \n\nEasily a 10/10 WRP!!\n\nNivea Pearl &amp; Beauty Roll On:\n\nVery average. It was the first one i used (canon event). formula feels slightly sticky for the first few minutes. No sweat control, it just mixes the smell with the deo’s. And no visible brightening. \n\n6/10 WNRP because there are better options now.\n\nRexona Shower Fresh Roll On:\n\ndecent for odour control but way too strong for sensitive skin gave me a slight burning sensation especially on freshly shaved days. works if you need something heavy, but it’s definitely not gentle. \n\n7.5/10 WNRP for me personally cause i have too sensitive skin.",

      "content": "I’ve been going to the same hairstylist for about two years now. We have great conversations, she sometimes gives me free trims, and I’ve recommended her to a lot of people (I’ve brought her multiple new clients). I was also one of her first regulars after she graduated cosmetology school, so we’ve kind of grown together.\n\nHere’s where I’m struggling.\n\nIn my area, there aren’t many hairstylists, especially blonding specialists. Recently, I’ve been low-key stalking the Instagram of another stylist. the girl who works at the chair behind hers. I LOVE her work. She focuses heavily on hair health and does the exact style I’m looking for.\n\nSome of the issues I’ve had with my current stylist:\n\t•\tShe bleaches over already bleached hair\n\t•\tMy balayage isn’t blended the way I like\n\t•\tMy inspo photos never really turn out how I want\n\t•\tI’m worried about long-term hair health\n\nI’ve tried to trust the process, but after two years, I still don’t feel like I’m getting the blonde I want.\n\nThe hard part is the emotional side. She calls me one of her favorite clients, we genuinely get along, and I feel bad because she’s been generous with me and I’ve supported her business from the start.\n\nBut at the same time… I’m spending a lot of money on my hair and I don’t love the results. The other stylist’s work aligns perfectly with what I want, especially her focus on keeping hair healthy.\n\nSo now I’m stuck between loyalty/guilt and doing what’s best for my hair.",

      "content": "Hi guys - I need some help as I’m not sure what’s going on… A couple of months ago, I noticed that I was getting dry, flaky skin on my eyelids. I assumed this was caused by, a) the winter weather and the heated air indoors, and b) migration of harsher products onto the more delicate eye skin during/after my routine. \n\nI came to reddit and one of the suggestions was to put Aquaphor on my eyes at the beginning of my routine, as in before any other products, to keep harsher exfoliants etc. away from them. Aquaphor was also recommended as being super moisturising. \n\nSo, I started using Aquaphor as my first product on a morning and evening and covered my whole eye contour with it. Then I would use my other products around it on the rest of my face. In the first couple of weeks of doing this, I did notice that the flaky skin on my eyes was healing up and the skin felt moisturised, so I kept doing it. \n\n After a month or so, it felt like the Aquaphor was less effective at healing up the dry skin (there was no flakiness anymore but still a slight redness and sensitivity on my eyelids), but it was preventing any new dryness from occurring and maintaining relatively healthy skin. \n\nFast forward to this morning - I wake up with very slight itchiness around my eyes, look in the mirror, and… I have huge dry patches mapping almost exactly on to where I have been applying the Aquaphor. \n\nI do not think this can be a reaction to the Aquaphor or any of its ingredients since I have been using it for weeks with no issues before now. Instead, I wondered whether putting the Aquaphor on at the start of my routine (before any of my moisturisers) had left my skin too dry in those areas since I was applying water and then nothing else except an occlusive? \n\nAssuming that using only Aquaphor with no moisturiser was the issue, I put my CosRX Snail 96 essence on this morning under the Aquaphor and it feels slightly better. But still, I’m confused as to why this reaction has happened so severely and so suddenly when I have made no recent routine changes - should I stop using Aquaphor altogether? \n\nAny help would be massively appreciated! See separate comment for current routine \n\n ",

Also if someone could tell me why type of hair I have because some is relatively straight, some is wavy and I get some curls? Backstory with more info below\n\nAs a kid (probably started from 11) I had thick, long hair. It didn’t look thick but there was more than anyone thought. I danced growing up so always had tight hairstyles but my hair was generally still in good condition. At 16 I was put on lithium (medication) and this started the decline of my hair. It thinned quite quick and bad, falling out non-stop and it started to look visibly damaged. I tried nioxin shampoo and conditioner with little improvement. About a year or so later, had a few issues with malnutrition which probably contributed. I’ve never had any bald spots which is a genuine shock with the amount of hair I drop. I’ve had schwarzkopf semi-permanent dye in it on a few occasions (red, blue, purple, pink). \n\nI’m currently alternating between Redken all soft shampoo + conditioner and olaplex No 4 + No 5, using almost cold water. I put Olaplex No 6 on towel dried hair after brushing. I’m using a wide tooth comb to brush, only after shower when wet and starting from the bottom. I do straighten it once or twice a week but will always straighten the front pieces as they are opposites and don’t look good. I’ve gotten different info from different people and I’m just looking for the most effective way to reverse as much damage as possible. I’ve trimmed and cut over the years and the length doesn’t seem to change the appearance. My hairs the one thing I like about myself and I’m quite conscious of how it looks and how damaged it is. \n\nPoint is, I’m after recommendations for routine and products to start somewhat restoring my hair and at least minimising frizz. I have attached some photos but they’re not the best. \n\nTia x",

I shower every 2 days and I wash my hair every time by washing the ends with my hands and using my fingertips to kinda massage my scalp, i use relatively cold water and sometimes i use warm water that's leaning more towards cold. so first question i have is: **Should i continue not using shampoo?** only downside is i cant use products or anything, but the thing is i cant buy many products even if i did use shampoo :/\n\nIf i should continue no-poo: **Any tips for haircare or products** that aren't *too expensive?* (tho i still have a feeling my parents wont be convinced to buy lol)\n\nif I should use shampoo: **Any tips?**\n\n# For the Hairstyle advice part:\n\nagain just incase: I have **3A hair**, and my lengths are: **Top-Front**: \\~3in/7cm | **Top**: \\~2.5in/6cm | **Sides &amp; Back(the top half):** \\~2.5in/6cm | **Sides &amp; Back(The bottom half)**: \\~2in/5cm | Keep in mind these measurements were done by me by hand and a ruler, so they will be a lil off.\n\nI'm going to get a haircut today as my school wants me to shorten my hair (tho tbh my hair was a bit messy today bcs i cant tame it😭 especially since idk HOW or WHAT to style it so if i can js \"hide\" the length..) so I'm down to hear any suggestions. i only have one condition: i **cant get a fade** or anything that shaves a part of my hair while leaving the rest (and i mean shave as in a zero)",

I have struggled with acne breakouts and acne since I was a teenager, and it is going well beyond my adolescent years as well.\n\nA few years ago, I went to a dermatologist, and was prescribed:\n\n1. Oral Antibiotics (Doxycycline)\n2. Neostrata Clarify Face Wash\n3. Neostrata Oily Skin Solution\n4. Adapalene\n5. Sunscreen (Clinic Brand)\n\nWhen I used these consistently, my acne cleared up quite well and I had clear-ish skin. Only reason I dropped out was bcs it was getting too expensive to justify shelling out hundreds of dollars every few months.\n\nMy question now is, how can I replicate this without going to the dermatologist again?\n\nRegarding the Doxycycline, I can get it via referral at a clinic, and when I had it before I didn't really notice any of the side effects (such as stomach pain, nauseau etc.).\n\nThis is my routine as of right now (I alternate Adapalene Every Other Night as of rn):\n\nAM:\n\n1. COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser\n2. ANUA Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner\n3. Cerave Moisturising Cream (For Dry to Very Dry Skin)\n4. Y.O.U Triple Care Acne Sunscreen\n\nPM (Adapalene Night):\n\n1. COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser\n2. Cerave Moisturising Cream (For Dry to Very Dry Skin) (Sandwich Method)\n3. Adapalene\n4. Cerave Moisturising Cream (For Dry to Very Dry Skin) (Sandwich Method)\n\nPM(Non-Adapalene Night):\n\n1. COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser\n2. ANUA Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner\n3. Cerave Moisturising Cream (For Dry to Very Dry Skin)\n\nMy main questions:  \n\\- What affordable products can replicate what Neostrata Clarify face wash and oily skin solution were doing?  \n\\- Should I add benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid?  \n\\- When does it make sense to add doxycycline again?\n\nThanks in advance!

I’m not used to getting this many spots, it’s very sore and itchy. Has anyone else had this issue.\n\nFor reference I have been using Bulldog face wash and moisturiser for months and have not had this problem.

Honestly, I've always been clueless about my curly/wavy hair and no one to ever ask tbh.\n\nMost conditioners usually weigh down my hair a lot and I struggle with finding hair products that I'm not allergic to.\n\nFor a year my hair routine worked great until my hair started shedding like a dog, I was mortified because it came out of no where! I have kept the same gel and mousse but my new shampoo/conditioner is super drying. I tried to soak my ends in coconut oil but it was like it just vanished in my frizz.\n\nI was using volumizing shampoo and conditioner from Native (yikes, I know, but I swear it was working) Now I'm using Maui Moisture lightweight shampoo/conditioner. (Waaaay to drying.)\n\nThen I finger comb and squeeze curl mousse and gel from Herbal Essences and air dry.\nI wash my hair twice a week and use Eva Nye freshen up dry shampoo maybe once a week when my roots get a little greasy.\nI also only use satin pillow cases. A little note to make, I have two lock of hair I usually keep braided like rat tails, but they're usually two big ringlets. Rn they're so dry and frizzy though.\n\nNow, here's my problem. I have A LOT of allergies. I cant have any sort of proteins like soy or nuts, nor gluten or eggs. I know that's definitely hard when looking for good curly products.\n\nSince I have my two little \"padawan\" braids, my hair is at two different lengths unstyled. I knowwwww it looks pathetic right now trust me, taking a picture of the back of my head felt like a JUMPSCARE 😆🤡 The first picture was my curls at their peak even while using Native at the time. Legit any advice helps thank youuuu!",

      "content": "I’m a 26 y/o female with long curly/wavy hair and it’s been breaking really bad for the last year or so. Breaks around about an inch or less from the root. I was using that Monday shampoo and conditioner, which made clumps of my hair fall out. I know it definitely started with that. I stopped using that, continued with a Kristin Ess deep clean/clarifying shampoo once a week and was using ogx otherwise. Still no help, so I switched to another Kristin ess shampoo for daily use (it’s an extra gentle shampoo), and using shea moisture strengthen &amp; restore masque, as well as argan oil when I’m out of the shower. I do not use heat on my hair, haven’t in years. I do not towel dry it besides the ends sometimes, I don’t put it in tight hairstyles, i only use 100% cotton towels and have special pillowcases for this and nothing is really working. Is there anything else I can be doing? I’m really at a loss at this point ",

I’m not a stylist but my former sister in law is and she taught me how to do everything myself and it’s worked until the last year. \nI’ve been using the same ratio (1:2 powder to level 20 developer) for 45 minutes and never had a problem. I only touch up about every 5 months. The last few times I’ve done my touch ups my hair has broken off a lot more, it’s dry after (never had that before) and it barely lightens. The Ice plus lilac toner used to get my hair pretty platinum but now it looks grey and dull \n\nI’m looking for good alternatives now because I want to keep doing this at home (cheaper) but I hate the new formula and what it’s doing to my hair. Any suggestions are appreciated!! ",
