Im back again with my reviews. + I USED AZIDERM 15\n\nDifference: Well ignore the huge brown one in the centre that scar is quite recent so i dont expect it to be gone anytime soon. THE SCARS AROUND IT HOWEVER. I have had them for around 2 and 1/2 years after picking on  my folliculities. MY DERMAT DIDNT HELP BTW. And just after 30 days THEY ARE FINALLY FADING OMG IM GONNA CRY. EVEN MY MOM (BIGGEST HATER BTW) SAID THEY BE FADING 😭🙏🙏🙏🤙🤙🤙🤙💌💌💌💌. I wear makeup everyday to hide em marks but well except for hiding that big centre one i got recently others require minimal to no makeup AT ALL. BLESSING OH GOSH 🙏🙏🙏🙏🥀🥀🥀  ANYWAY ONTO THE REVIEW\n\nFIRST OF ALL ID LIKE TO THANK \n\nAZIDERM 15 \n\nI used to use azeliac acid 10% The ordinary. Never really worked much. BUT THIS STUFF CHANGED EVERYTHING. Its very grainy and if you dont pat ur face fully dry before applying IT ITCHES AND STINGS but worth everything. I use it every next night, pea sized amount WHOLE FACE. Dot forget ur Sunscreen!! 8/10 \n\nMOVING ON TO SUNSCREEN\n\nUV DOUX D TAN \n\nWell sorry but it works but does have its own disadvantages. You need to blend it in superhard until all the white stuff disappears and trust me 2 fingers worth of it dont blend in that easily. Its quite moody AND PILLS OCCASIONALLY. Enough blending prevents pilling but if ya dont blend it for 15 full mins 🥰🥰💔💔💔💔 u are cooked. But I do feel like it provides awesome protection. 6/10\n\nMOISTURIZER\n\nHOLY GRAIL. ATODERM IS PEAK IN THESE HARSH WINTERS OH GOD. LOVE LOVE LOVE 10/10 💌💌💌🙏🙏🙏🙏\n\nSERUMS\n\nMINIMALIST NIACINAMIDE,ALPHA ARBUTIN AND RETINOL I think play a pretty huge role too \n Niacidnamide 9/10\nArbutin 8/10 (too foamy)\nRetinol 7/10 (I dont like the base oil)\n\nEYE CREAM\n\nMinimalist Retinal eyecream. Does literally nothing btw. Waste of money 3/10 just for the cooling effect. \n\n\nTHATS IT YALL BYE BYE 🔥🔥🔥🤙🤙🤙🐎🐎💦💦💦💦",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

Nizoral (x2 a week, I don’t even think I’ve used it more than 3 times total), pumpkin seed oil tablets, iron, Spironolactone. \n\n For dryness, I started Pantene miracle rescue conditioner and leave in spray. I switched from coconut oil to jojoba with rosemary for scalp oiling because I think I have fine hair and coconut clogs pores I believe?\n\nAdditionally not using heat, maybe a blow dryer two weeks ago but nothing else, sleeping in a bonnet. \n\nIt’s been 2 weeks since I chopped dry ends off and I see split ends and brittle ends again.\n\nIs there anything else I can add to my routine to help with that?

      "content": "26M | Oily Skin | Routine Review + Barrier Safety, Retinol &amp; Product Suggestions\n\nHi everyone,  \n  \nI’m a 26-year-old male with oily skin and wanted some help reviewing my current skincare and hair care routine. I feel I might be overdoing certain actives, and I’m also noticing slight darkening on my forehead, possibly due to regular hair oiling. I’d really appreciate feedback and suggestions.\n\n# Current Skincare Routine\n\nFace Wash:\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid + LHA Cleanser – 2 times a day\n\nSerum:\n\n* The Derma Co 2% Kojic Acid Serum – morning &amp; night after cleansing\n\nMoisturizer:\n\n* Minimalist Vitamin B5 10% Moisturizer\n* Re’equil Ceramide &amp; Hyaluronic Acid (alternate) (Currently not using)\n\nSunscreen:\n\n* Aqualogica Glow+ Dewy Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ – morning and when stepping out\n\nWeekly Exfoliation:\n\n* The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution – 2x a week (Monday &amp; Friday)\n\nLips:\n\n* Vaseline Lip Balm\n\nBody Care:\n\n* 1% Salicylic Acid Body Wash – daily\n\n# Hair Care Routine\n\n* Shampoo: Arata Super Shampoo – 2x a week\n* Hair Oil: Rosemary + Lavender Hair Oil – used regularly after hair wash\n\nI don’t have hair fall issues, but I feel frequent oiling may be causing product buildup and contributing to forehead darkening or clogged pores near the hairline.\n\n# What I Need Help With\n\n1. Barrier-safe routine: I often see the term barrier-safe here.\n   * What does it actually mean?\n   * Am I overusing actives like salicylic acid, kojic acid, or chemical exfoliation?\n   * What are early signs of a damaged skin barrier in oily skin?\n2. Retinol guidance: I’ve never used retinol before.\n   * Should I add retinol at my age and skin type?\n   * What beginner strength should I start with?\n   * How many times a week is safe initially?\n   * Do I need to stop or reduce other actives if I introduce retinol?\n3. Sunscreen recommendations: I’ve seen many sunscreen suggestions in this sub.\n   * Is my current sunscreen okay for oily skin or should I switch to something more matte/oil-control?\n   * What should I look for in a good sunscreen (PA rating, filters, texture)?\n   * Is sunscreen necessary indoors?\n4. Snail mucin &amp; hydration products: I keep seeing snail mucin and barrier-repair products mentioned.\n   * What does snail mucin actually help with?\n   * Is it suitable for oily skin?\n   * Can it be used alongside actives like retinol or exfoliants?\n5. Hair oil &amp; forehead pigmentation:\n   * Should I reduce oiling frequency or change the oil type?\n   * Any tips to prevent oil-related pigmentation or breakouts near the hairline?\n\nMy goal is to build a simple, long-term, barrier-safe routine rather than using too many actives.  \n  \nThanks in advance, would really appreciate your guidance.",

Does anyone else feel this way?  \n\n\nI typically start my routine off with some coconut oil from OGX on the ends, and leave it for at least 10 minutes before i shower. In the shower, I use treseme shampoo, dove bond strength mask, then tresseme conditioner. \n\nWhen i get out of the shower, I wrap it in a hair towel for 5 or so minutes. Then I’ll go in with leave in products such as Not Your Mothers wavy leave in spray, and then I’ll go in with a veryyyyy small amount of the Olaplex No 6 and mix that in with Not Your Mothers air dry cream and olaplex oil. \n\n\nAfter i do all that, I will actually go back with a spray bottle and re-soak my hair, and allow my hair to air dry afterwards. For some reason this has been the best way to form my waves. I’ve tried scrunching, curl/wave specific products, diffusing, etc—but i feel like my wave pattern doesn’t suit these methods. I like the way my waves naturally form on their own without any mechanical manipulation to them.

      "title": "[review] Lutronic Ultra laser honest review (and compared to CO2 two years ago)",
      "content": "Hi! I haven't seen much online in the way of Lutronic Ultra laser reviews (not to be confused with UltraClear), so I thought I'd add my two cents here. I don't post photos of my face on Reddit but happy to answer any questions you have. (I did the Ultra on December 19, so I'm a little over 3 weeks post-laser. I'm a 40yo female.)\n\nTwo years ago, I did Lutronic's eCO Tone laser, but my derm recommended the Ultra this time because it's less down time, and she thought I'd see equally great results. My main concerns were normal aging (fine lines, ect) and sagging, especially around my under-eyes. I have clear skin in general, but it's sensitive, fair, and tends to be dry. No major acne scars, hyperpigmentation, or sun damage.\n\nI did have them do my eyes/eyelids with both lasers; I don't see the point in going through all of this only to leave your eyes out, especially as my under-eyes are my biggest gripe. The eye shields don't hurt because of numbing drops, but you can feel a slight pressure, and they do weird me out. Here are both my experiences and my takeaways. \n\n**CO2 (cost me $1200) experience and aftermath (in the first week):**\n\nI was numbed for about 30 minutes but it was still uncomfortable, especially on the eyes where the numbing cream doesn't go. You just grit your teeth and bear it. \n\nImmediately following the CO2, I was super splotchy and red and had lots of pinpoint-bleeding. That lasted a few days. In that time, I also had what I've been told was an immunological response, with lots of tiny, flat pustules that looked like whiteheads but weren't. They went away pretty quick (I get that same response after a peel, though). I stopped doing the occlusive skin care because that was making it worse (vinegar soaks and the pre-procedure gel instead). Overall, just a little swelling, gone by day 3. The bleeding was gone by day 4; at that point, I was still a little red/streaky but much closer to normal. Day 5, I looked a little sunburned. Day 7, I was still pink but otherwise my skin looked AWESOME! \n\n\\*\\*\\*This is obvious and they drill it into your skull, but hear it from me, the layperson: You canNOT pick at your skin, even if you have those pustule-whiteheads that you're dying to get rid of. You will bleed and make it look way worse. Your skin is SOOO sensitive for weeks after. DO NOT PICK. RESIST. \n\n**CO2 results (after a week):** \n\nSmaller pores, very glowy, and major reduction in fine lines, especially smile lines around my mouth. It almost completely got rid of one of them. After time, I also noticed a reduction in my forehead lines. Overall, very happy with the results. Couldn't tell much in the way of sun damage/spots but I don't think I had much to begin with. \n\n**Ultra (cost me $500 but it was on sale that month, normally $850) experience and aftermath (in the first week):** \n\nNumbed for 45ish minutes but it still HURT. Don't believe anyone who says it doesn't. They're sandbagging you. Kudos to the laser technician who was so kind and gave me an awesome squeezy ball during the procedure. They also did my neck, which I didn't have done on the CO2. Way less painful on the neck. \n\nImmediately following the Ultra, I was very red and my eyelids were already swollen, but I had light swelling everywhere. Felt really hot and tight, as to be expected. That only lasted a few hours. No occlusive, just hyaluronic acid boosters and gentle moisturizer and the post-procedure stuff they give you. Redness went way down by that evening. Day 2: Really blotchy and lots of swelling with eyelids and under-eyes (like what you look like after crying for a few days straight). The upper eye swelling was gone by day 3, but the under-eye swelling lingered until about day 5—that was the most noticeable thing (very \"old man baggy eyelids\"). And on days 3-4, my face was ITCHY! I was also especially blotchy around the areas she really targeted. By days 4-5, the swelling was gone, along with most of the splotch except for a few small, minor stubborn areas. Started to reach glowy stage days 5-6. Day 7, skin was looking really glowy! \n\n**Ultra results (after a week):** Smaller pores, glowy, but not as noticeable a reduction in any fine lines. Maybe my expectations were too high following the CO2, *and* the technician said with the new Ultra tech, I should still be seeing results as far out a year. I was also hoping for a bit more of a miracle with my under-eyes but that's probably a pipe dream (and a bleph). \n\n**CO2 vs Ultra?** I'd probably do CO2 again because the results were more drastic, even if the downtime was longer. But that was just my experience! Hope that helps! ",

She was diagnosed with PCOS, irregular periods and acne. She tried a lot of different ways to remove her acne, topical medicine, birth control and etc. but seems like nothing works and it’s affecting her daily lifestyle. Like she can’t do anything because she is too self conscious of how she looks. \n\nRecently she tried dermatica with doxyciline (I think it’s the antibiotics) but I think she put the Dermatica topical lotion too much and caused her to have irritation. She has a tendency to put a lot of topical lotion since young which may have made her skin very sensitive now. When she was on the doxy everything was great and she was able to live normally, but now that she is off and still has acne, she is feeling bad again. \n\nThey’ve now told her that she potentially has periodical dermatitis. But now she is rethinking everything for example how much moisturizer to put, no more lotion for now and that freaks her out because she thinks more acne will come out. \n\nSo just want to support her and make her be able to be herself and live without having to think or worry so much about her skin. \n\nDoes anyone have any solutions or recommendations? Or rules that should be followed like no spicy food? \n\nThanks in advance ",

For context, I wash my hair almost every day, usually giving it one day off between washes. However, after washing it, my hair already looks a bit greasy the next day and turns into a complete mess by the day after that. I try putting it into a bun to make the greasiness less noticeable, which helps only a bit, but it’s still hella annoying to wake up and see my hair looking awful. On top of that, I’ve been getting pimples around my hairline, probably because of how oily my hair gets. I use an anti-dandruff shampoo since I’m unfortunately prone to dandruff. How do I fix this greasiness and the pimple issue? I’ve tried spacing out my washes, but it doesn’t really help... That, and I can't be walking out looking like a greasy mess at work.\nCould this be because of my thin hair? Should I get a cleansing shampoo? Anything will be greatly appreciated.",

I gym every morning and would like to keep it clean between washes \n(routine: Shampoo x2 and condition every Thursday and Sunday, scrubbing scalp with NuBrush during shampoo, detangling brush, then the \"you'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel\" move to dry) \n\n- What shampoo and conditioner would you recommend? I currently used OGX coconut but have been reading of some issues people have had. I'd ideally like to not spend much more than what these are ($12AUD ea) but happy to stretch and bit for something good. \n\n- Is there something I can wear on it at night to not wake up with a rats nest? It's long enough to put in a bun but I find when I take it out, it is very straw-like in shape and texture. Something like a silk wrap? \n\n\nAny and all advise is greatly appreciated 🙏",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to hear from others who’ve had a similar experience.\n\nI’ve been on dutasteride and oral minoxidil for about 2.5 years, but my hair loss has continued to progress with no noticeable slowing or regrowth.\n\nOver the past few years I’ve also had extensive blood work and endocrine evaluation due to consistently elevated FT3/FT4, while TSH has remained in range. All follow-up testing (antibodies, imaging, uptake scan, pituitary evaluation) came back normal, and my endocrinologist considers the findings benign.\n\nDespite this, my hair loss keeps worsening. One other factor worth mentioning is that I’ve been a long-term nicotine user and am currently working on quitting.\n\nI’m not asking for medical advice or a diagnosis, just wondering:\n\n\t•\tDid anything else (lifestyle changes, quitting nicotine, adjusting treatment, time) end up making a difference?\n\nAppreciate any shared experiences.\n",
