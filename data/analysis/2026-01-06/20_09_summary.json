I recently just cut off 3 inches of my bleached under dye to try and get rid of all of my split ends and breakage so on my acknowledgment of trying to keep my hair healthier I don’t know how often I should be washing my head. Should I base it off of how quickly my hair gets oily or should I wash it like twice a week which is what I do now.\n\nmy routine since it’s mandatory\n\nI use the not your mother’s curly bonding shampoo and conditioner on Sundays. I use the eva NYC deep conditioner.\n\nto style I use skala as my leave and not your mother‘s moose and the big papa gel\n\nusually all air dry if I have time, but if not, then I diffuse, which makes my hair look like shit. I don’t know if I’m just doing it wrong.\n\nalso, I use silk hair ties and the silk bonnet every night to sleep",

It was the first one i used (canon event). formula feels slightly sticky for the first few minutes. No sweat control, it just mixes the smell with the deo’s. And no visible brightening. \n\n6/10 WNRP because there are better options now.\n\nRexona Shower Fresh Roll On:\n\ndecent for odour control but way too strong for sensitive skin gave me a slight burning sensation especially on freshly shaved days. works if you need something heavy, but it’s definitely not gentle. \n\n7.5/10 WNRP for me personally cause i have too sensitive skin.",

In the 10+ years I've been hyper-fixated on skincare, I've seen so many studies, reviews, etc. about the wonders of vitamin c for brightening, lightening dark spots, and generally evening skin tone. When I tell you I have tried every single derivative from the Mississippi to South Korea though...\n\nI've gone expensive (SkinCeuticals). I've gone mid-range (Timeless). I've gone single-ingredient derivatives from TO and others. I've tried pure ascorbic acid powder mixed with serums, I've even dabbled in DIY skincare with multiple formulations from classic recipes to full-blown science experiments with trademarked vitamin C matrixes. Once a day, twice a day, thrice a day even (not my best idea.\n\nI truly don't think I've ever seen a benefit. My main issue is sun damage (le dark spots) and I know that's a fickle problem to work with, however at this point I know how to spot when an active is working because I've seen it happen with other ones. But zilch with Vitamin C.\n\nI feel like I'm crazy. This is one of the most studied actives in OTC skincare. I believe the science. And l've seen the results people have, which I'm extremely envious of. So l've kept using it...all this time. But I think I'm finally at a point where it just feels unnecessary and pointless for me.\n\nIs there anyone out there like me? What is wrong with my skin???",

I’m 22 years old, and first noticed that my hair had changed about three years go (now, in retrospect, I realize that I was thinning). Just over two months ago, I started taking 1mg of oral fin and 3mg of oral min. The first photo is from late October, and the second was taken today. As you can see, the middle of the top of my head is noticeably darker. Of course, there’s lots of progress to be made, but I’m just so relieved that the medication is working, and working relatively quickly. I’ll admit that I had my hesitancies prior to starting the meds, but I’d really encourage anyone who’s experiencing MPB to give them a try!\n\nThanks!",

      "title": "Can I use retinal at 14? [Routine help]",
      "content": "Hey everyone 🤍\nSorry in advance for the long post — I’m a teen and pretty paranoid about my skin, so I want to give enough context before asking for advice.\n\nI’ve been dealing with comedonal acne (closed + some open comedones) for about 2–3 years. After a lot of research, I slowly started introducing actives instead of jumping into things.\n\nI began with a 2% salicylic acid cleanser 1–2x/week alongside SPF and moisturizer, then gradually worked up to daily use. For the first 2–3 months, my skin improved noticeably. However, once I started using it every day, my skin became very sensitive, so I stopped cleansing for a while (budget reasons — I didn’t have a backup cleanser).\n\nMy skin barrier recovered and felt healthy again, but my texture and comedonal acne returned, along with very pronounced sebaceous filaments (I know they’re normal, but mine are extremely noticeable).\n\nThinking SA might be too harsh for me, I looked for alternatives and found a Dr. Shereene Idriss video where she mentioned glycolic acid for people who don’t tolerate SA well. Since glycolic felt a bit too aggressive/anti-aging focused for my age, and mandelic felt too mild, I tried 10% lactic acid instead.\nHonestly, I didn’t see improvement — it mainly just made my skin feel slightly sensitive, so I stopped.\n\nAfter another break from actives, I reintroduced salicylic acid, but this time as a leave-on serum so I could target specific areas. I used it 1x/week, then 2x/week max. This helped reduce breakouts and slightly improved closed comedones, but it did nothing for sebaceous filaments or open comedones.\n\nI considered benzoyl peroxide, but I’ve used it on my back before and had a really bad reaction, so I’m hesitant to try it on my face.\n\nAt this point, whenever I strip my routine back to basics, my skin actually gets worse — not better.\nSo now, after ~3 years of trial and error, I’m considering vitamin A. I know it’s commonly recommended for acne and sebaceous filaments, and I also know it was originally developed for acne, not anti-aging.\nI’m not able to see a dermatologist right now, which is why I’m asking here. I’m thinking of starting with retinal since it’s often described as gentler than tretinoin, but I’m honestly terrified of damaging my skin barrier.\n\nPlease don’t tell me to “just leave my skin alone and it’ll fix itself” — I’ve tried that multiple times, and my acne and texture become more pronounced. I’m very conscious of barrier health and I’m not overusing actives.\n\nFor context:\n• I work out ~2x/week\n• I try to eat fairly balanced\n• Lifestyle changes haven’t noticeably affected my skin\n\nSo my main question is:\nIs retinal safe or reasonable to use at 14 for comedonal acne if introduced very slowly, or is this something I should absolutely avoid?\n\nAny advice or experiences would mean a lot 🤍 Thank you!",

I seem to have a mix of dry and oily skin, but it kind of behaves in a really confusing way.\n\nIssues that I have observed:\n\n• Right after I step out of the shower, my face feels tight and very dry and if I don’t apply anything, it dries out badly and I break out.\n\n• But if I apply moisturizer and sunscreen, my skin gets oily quickly, pores on my cheeks look very large, and acne scars, sebaceous filaments on my nose look much more visible (it even makes my nose look swollen lol)\n\nMy current routine:\n\nAM: • CeraVe 2% salicylic acid cleanser • CeraVe light moisturizer • Neutrogena SPF 50 sunscreen\n\nMidday: • Hyaluronic acid cleanser\n\nPM (rotating): • Neutrogena retinol cream • The Ordinary hyaluronic acid • The Ordinary salicylic acid serum\n\nI try to:\n\n• Drink 3-4L water daily • Eat clean, avoid greasy foods\n\nWhat I don’t seem to understand are:\n\n1)Is this dehydrated skin, damaged barrier, or true combination skin? 2)Why do moisturizer and sunscreen make my skin look oilier and pores more visible? Am I over-exfoliating or using too many actives? 3)How can I hydrate my skin without making it greasy or emphasizing texture?\n\nI’d really appreciate any guidance on what I should simplify, remove, or add.\n\nThank you!",

This is how my nose looks after my morning hydrating cream (KTW birch water mild facial cream, it has been discontinued so I need something else soon) and when I apply BB cream to it (it's from a local company called Nuoderm, it's very pigmented and otherwise very good on the rest of my face). It peels right off, and it's very hard to bring it to a stable state to accept coverage over it, obviously it gets red when I try to remove the skin that peels off.\nI tried Nyx glue primer, again it was flaky. Tried 2 primers from catrice, oil control and poreless blur, it behaved similarly. I don't know what to do to keep this under control for good. I usually apply vitamin C serum + niacinamide serum from the ordinary in the morning but I didn't have them with me this morning so I didn't apply them. I have to mention that very often it reacts like this with other products (concealer for example). Any advice, please? Can any primer help with this? The other primers I used were generally ok on the rest of my face and prevented the makeup from going cakey but not on my nose and on the sides of my nose. Thanks a lot in advance!",

      "content": "i’m a 26f living in the US and have always had a pretty low maintenance routine. i think i have normal, oily or combination skin. i get a few pimples around my cycle but have never had any major issues with acne. my skin looks a little dry and dull in the winter and normal in the summer. my nose however is ALWAYS oily, my pores always look super clogged on my nose and is my biggest problem area when i do get pimples. my chin and forehead also get oily sometimes. \n\ni haven’t explored many products or brands. i’ve used neutrogena for most of my life (clean and clear as a teenager). but i did try the la roche posay toleraine purifying foaming cleanser and the double repair matte moisturizer which immediately made me breakout with tiny red dots all over my cheeks so i stopped using both after less than a week. then i tried a few peach and lily products at ulta (oasis serum, matcha pudding moisturizer and glass skin luminizing stick). probably shouldn’t have put them all on at once but had the same thing with the little red dots and just hated how heavy it felt so i had to take it off immediately. not sure if this means i have sensitive skin but thought i should mention it.\n\ncurrently this is my skincare routine, i do the same steps for morning and evening everyday: \n\n1. cleanser: neutrogena hydro boost exfoliating cleanser with hylauronic acid\n 2. toner: neutrogena alcohol free toner\n3. moisturizer: neutrogena ultra gentle facial moisturizer. \n\nmy skin has been fine with this routine, but it’s just very meh for me. it doesn’t cause me to break out, but my skin still feels dull and not as hydrated, soft or bright as i’d like it to be. i’m wanting to achieve more of that dewy, glowy look.\n\nhere are some products i am looking to replace or add to my routine. would love some recommendations! \n\n1. cleanser: a good cleanser for daily use, preferably a gel or water based texture that will clean thoroughly and still give me some hydration. \n\n2. toner: a good toner for daily use: not really sure what i should be looking for here as i’m still slightly confused about what a toner actually does. i feel like all the recommendations i see are for milky toners but i think it might not work too well with my oily skin. i want something light and refreshing that makes my face feel bright and awake. possibly something to address my nose pores but i don’t know if that would be too harsh for every day? really need some guidance in this category. \n\n3. serum: i’ve never really used serum but am interested in adding one to my routine. maybe something that can give me more glow and hydration but i’m open to really any recommendations. i tried the osea hylauronic serum the other day and would love to find something that feels similar on my skin that doesn’t cost almost $100. \n\n4. moisturizer: a water or gel based moisturizer that is lightweight and super hydrating without being oily. i tried the osea seabiotic water cream and LOVED the consistency and feel on my skin. i’m considering splurging on this but would love to hear of any alternatives that may be more affordable. currently eyeing the cocokind electrolyte water cream. \n\njust a few disclaimers: i’d really like to stay away from brands like vanicream, cerave and cetaphil. it sounds dumb but the packaging is hideous. i’m wanting a skincare routine that makes me feel like i’m pampering myself and would love some slightly more luxurious recommendations :) doesn’t need to be crazy expensive but at least something that looks nice. i’m also really interested in brands that use more clean and natural ingredients. \n\n",

      "content": "So i bought the ordinary peeling solution in November 2025 first week and when I used for the first time.....I was like, yes I found the one product which i can use of I want a instant glow, because it made my skin very clean. For context, I have normal skin with oily t zone and didn't have any pimples that time, but my face wasn't clear either. It had some small acne marks, and pores. I'm not saying peeling solution removed any of that, but for that week after using it, my face was brighter and it had that healthy glow. It was like an upper layer of skin of dead cells got removed (I know peeling solution is supposed to do that),I was so happy with it. And I used it after 10 days, the same thing happened, it gave me a glow. \n\nFast forward to the next time I used, nothing happened after I used it. I still got that tingling sensation the first time I used it, but there was no glow in my face. So i thought maybe it's because I was over exfoliating. So the next time I used was more than 2 weeks later. But still the same, there was no visible glow or any change at all. \n\nSo i want to know, what is actually happening here? Now all that peeling solution does is it kinda kills my one or two pimples which comes during periods. \nI searched in the internet for similar experiences, but found none. So if anyone have any idea regarding this please do share🥹\nI'm also attaching my skin right after I used the peeling solution for reference.",

      "title": "At my wits end with my hair",
      "content": "This is a repost since I used incorrect terminology. \n\nHi so i'm at my wits end with my hair. Its velcroey most of the time and it dries very inconsistently, sometimes it will have great 2C-3A curls but most of the time it just looks like this stringy clumpy mess. Testing products is very overwhelming for me because everything i've tried in the past has given me inconsistent results if any. I really don't know what my hair wants. This week I straightened it and felt so jealous of people with straight hair cause it was so manageable but I don't have time to do that often.\n\nI recently got a pretty big haircut after having layered hair for a long time because layers just weren't working either, my hair would get suuuper tangled. Here are some routines and products I use/have used in the past:\n\nThrough 2024 I did this about once every 5 days:\n\nShea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine shampoo\n\nShea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine conditioner (leave in 3 minutes)\n\nShea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie (scrunching)\n\nPlopping for about 30 mins\n\nAir dry or (if I had time) diffusing\n\nThe first 2 times my hair looked amazing, I had an old tester of these products and my hair looked so good that I decided to buy them. After using them a few times it started to become clear that this was too heavy on my hair, particularly the Smoothie. The Smoothie would usually (though not always, as I said my hair does whatever it wants) leave my hair clumpy and almost sticky. If I slept on it it would just become this huge clump or mass even if I used an extremely (and I mean extremely) small amount. So I stopped using it. Then I continued using the same products but started using the Garnier Fructis Pistachio Cream as a leave in instead. The same thing happened to a lesser extent. It wasn't so much that my curls were weighed down, it was more so that they would stick to each other.\n\nI stopped using that too after trying to apply it on wet, damp and dry hair with no success.\n\nAfter this I became sorta apathetic, I bought a shampoo and some conditioner in bar format from an artisanal soap maker due to environmental concerns about plastic. I just use the shampoo twice and the conditioner for 3 minutes and that's it. I started doing this in hopes that a more simple routine would be better for my hair, I even tried co washing to no avail. As with the shea moisture products, my hair looked great the first day and then started looking bad again. I can post the ingredients of these products here cause they aren't from a big brand:\n\nThe shampoo contains:\n\nCoconut surfactants, silk protein, peruvian ginseng, castor oil, indian gooseberry, moringa, bhringaraj, vegetable inulin, pink clay, cosgard, d-panthenol and salvia and rosemary essential oils.\n\nThe conditioner contains:\n\nCocoa and coconut butter, jojoba oil, cetylic alcohol, vitamin E, d-panthenol, silk protein and lavender and lemon essential oils.\n\nIt's also important to mention that in the past, I have tried oiling my hair for about 2 hours before showering, using olive oil and castor oil. It didn't make much of a difference.\n\nI've also tried sleeping with a silk bonnet but my hair still looks super deformed and squished the next day, if I use a curl cream and sleep with the bonnet it looks even worse because it just becomes a huge mass as i mentioned before. It's also worth mentioning that diffusing, even in low heat and low power still makes my hair very frizzy.\n\nAfter the shea moisture issue I'm scared of buying expensive products that don't work for me and since I live in Europe some of the products recommended here are unavailable. I'm also boycotting amazon so I have a smaller window of affordable options.\n\nI struggle a lot with sensory issues pertaining washing my hair so I hate having too many products in it. I'm seriously at my wits end, I know I haven't done everything I can but I've had days where I spend so long on my hair just for it to look like this that t I just can't be bothered.\n\nI want some advice or success stories since finding products feels overwhelming, I don't know what to use or what my hair needs and everyone talks about so many things like amino acids and proteins and butters and oils that I just don't know where to even begin.\n\nSorry for the wall of text and for the rant I just wanted some advice.\n\n",

As I've shifted towards a more natural look, I've struggled with these feelings and the pressure to conform to certain ideals. I find myself questioning whether I look \"good enough\" without makeup. I'm curious how others navigate this journey. What strategies do you use to embrace your natural beauty? Have you found certain affirmations or practices that help boost your confidence? Additionally, how do you handle comparisons with others, especially if they seem to fit traditional beauty norms?

When I'm in the shower sometimes I cry of exhaustion because it takes HOURS to detangle and my hands hurt so much, and so does my scalp. Some years ago I tried straightnening (is this the right term? English isn't my first language) it for good but my hair just kept getting curly again even after 3-4 years of straightnening it. I just don't know what to do anymore, do you have any advice?

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",
