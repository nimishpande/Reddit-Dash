In the shower when I start scrunching it looks quite nice but after the drying process (and especially the next day it looks terrible!) \n\nI usually start with brushing my hair before washing it. First I use shampoo I use the nutritive shampoo, hair mask and conditioner. I will detangle my hair while in the shower with the conditioner in. Then I will wash it out and start scrunching all the water out. After that I will use some hair gel (it’s a strong paste from a local hair dresser that I delude with some water to create a more creamy texture) and scrunch it into my hair after that I will use a towel and scrunch to get the excess water off. Then I try and diffuse my hair which is still a bit of process. After that I plop it into a t shirt and wait till the last bits dry and it sets and that’s how I end up here. Am i using the wrong products or should I use a different method? I saw some people use a comb and twirl the hair around that, is that more suited for curlier than wavy hair or the other way around? \nAnyways I’m super thankful for any suggestions or tips on how to deal with this mess.

      "content": "My first ever reddit post is concerning my 4y/o daughter's hair, I would be grateful for any advice! My oldest daughter and I both have straight hair, so I'm a newbie to this curly world. I am asking for tips, because she likes when her hair is curly. 🩷\n\nOur current routine is: \n\nWash at night with a gentle shampoo (usually it's some kid-brand from DM). Spray in detangler, brush through, air-dry. It's usually only damp by the time she goes to bed. In the morning we brush through it again &amp; put it up. When we do this, it still has waves, but the curls aren't there anymore. Since we only wash hair once a week (ish), by the end of the week it's pretty straight. (Reference pic with the pumpkin). If I blow dry her hair it dries very straight and silky smooth.\n\nHowever, I tried to choose pictures that represent how it *can* look, because when she washes in the morning &amp; it air dries it's got a great curl pattern, but only underneath. The top layer is still pretty straight. She loves when it curls like this &amp; wants it more often! The only change to the routine here is that we washed in the AM and didn't brush it when it was wet. \n\nHer hair is a fine texture and is very silky, but she has a lot of it! \n\nAny recommendations for how I can maximize this look for her, on days where she wants it curly? I'm open to trying products, but she's 4, so I'll stick to drug store prices. ;) For reference, we live in Germany. \n\nMany thanks! ",

      "title": "Dr Dennis Gross daily peel - universal vs ultra gentle",
      "content": "Hello!\n\nJust noticed that there were not any answered posts about the Dr Dennis Gross daily peels here and since I am an inconsistent user searching for some answers myself, thought I’d share my experience with you girlies 🥹\n\nSo they come in three types - ultra gentle, normal/universal, extra strength. I’ve tried the first two types. Since I have sensitive skin I never thought of trying the extra strong ones. I would suggest to go for the normal one unless you have super sensitive skin (which I do) - then try the ultra gentle ones first.\n\nNow these are a two step routine thingy - steps are basically opening the pack and rubbing the cotton pad soaked in the essence on your face lol. So you wash your face, do first step (exfoliation), after couple of minutes do the second step (anti-ageing) and wait another two minutes before moisturizing.\n\nFirst off, yes, they are expensive. I have only gotten them by paying frens who have visited the States. But the only person I know IRL who uses them regularly is my best fren and she swears by it because she’s a PCOS girlie with angry skin. So I tried them and I am glad I did - even as someone who sucks at consistency, I do really like the effect it has on me even if I can use it for a few weeks on end. You can buy a ziploc pouch, cut each pad in half, and preserve the other half inside the package and ziploc for the next use. Cuz duh they’re expensive. \n\nSecondly, don’t start every day at first. Let your skin get used to it. When I used the orange peel for the first time I overexfoliated like a dumbass. Do it once or twice a week depending on how sensitive your skin is I guess at first. \n\nThird, don’t overdo rest of your actives. The peel pads contain Citric Acid, Lactic Acid, Malic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Retinol, Tocopheryl Acetate etc. Basically retinoids, AHA/BHA are already there in the peels so it might be wise not to use other exfoliants or strong acids in your routine if you’re using this! I didn’t realise this and coupled the peel with a cleanser that had AHA BHA PHA and my skin got so dry 😭\n\nNext - ensure you use sunscreen! I can’t stress this enough. Because you _will_ get sunburnt if you don’t. I made this mistake once inspite of the packaging begging me to use sunscreen. Don’t be like me lol.\n\nLastly - MOISTURISE! The peel uses strong ingredients especially if you have sensitive skin like me so please for the love of god moisturise your skin girlllllll. I use 1.5-2x my usual moisturiser when I use the peel pads. \n\nAnyways, this was not a paid Dennis Gross advert lol. But I will try to be consistent and share the effects of the ultra gentle peel once I’ve used it regularly for like a month or so. This is one of the only products where I’ve felt a difference immediately after using it - almost feels like make up lol. The first set of photos is post using the normal peel and second set is using the ultra gentle peel. The rest of the steps were the same (washing face with a gentle cleanser like cetaphil then peel and then centella toner by skin1004 followed by bioderma sensibio pink moisturiser). Of course the quality of my skin is worse in the second set because the photos are taken months apart xD But I still wanted to share them for reference in case it might help somebody. ",

Pre chemo I had very long straight smooth (but fine) hair. I chopped it to chin length and did scalp cooling to try and preserve my hair. It somewhat worked but I lost at least half. Now I have a small amount of the original hair down to my chin and 1-2inches of new hair growing in all over my scalp. The new hair feels coarser and wants to point directly up and out. I’m grateful not to have my scalp visible as much but I look like a mad scientist no matter what I do.\n\npics 1 and 2 are what it does naturally, pic 3 is my best attempt to smooth it down. \n\nWhat can I do to get through this horrible in between phase? I feel like I need to get it cut into a pixie but I know it won’t suit me and I resent paying for a haircut I’ll hate. Also I’ll have to go through the awkward in-between phase when the pixie grows out, so maybe I should grit my teeth and just stick with the growth.\n\nAny suggestions what I can do to style it in the meantime? Or must I live with the cancer patient hats and scarves for a few more months?",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
