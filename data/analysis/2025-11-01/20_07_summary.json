      "content": "I started losing my hair at 23. I’m 27 now and it’s noticeable enough that people politely pretend not to notice. I’ve tried everything you’re “supposed” to try minoxidil, finasteride, special shampoos, diet changes. Nothing has stopped it. I know looks aren’t everything, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m aging in fast forward while everyone else gets to look young a little longer. The vanity part stings, but honestly the confidence hit is worse\n\nDating apps made it very clear how much people care about hair. My matches dropped like 90% as soon as it started thinning. It’s depressing to realize how quickly you become “less attractive” over something you can’t control.\n\nI play battlefield with friends most nights and even in the chat, jokes get tossed around about my hairline like it’s just harmless fun. Maybe for them it is. For me it’s a constant reminder.\n\nSo I’m asking guys who’ve been through this:  \nDo I just shave it and move on?  \nDoes confidence really make that much of a difference?  \nHow do you accept a change you never wanted?\n\nI don’t want to feel embarrassed about something that’s just genetics but right now I do.",

I use just a regular basic dove shampoo and conditioner and after I apply the cantu I let it air dry. \n\nI sometimes have used the got2b curling mouse but I don’t like how this makes my curls thinner and more straw like?? Idk, they just fall down more and I don’t like how it looks. My hair is very very dry and frizzy as you can see from the photos and throughout the week it gets a lot more greasy too.\nI’d love to have curls like the guy in the last pic however I just think our texture is not the same \n\nI am unfortunately on a budget so welcoming any tips and advice as well as product recommendations.

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Prone to comedones.\n\nSkin care Routine:\nAM: \n1. Simple Refreshing Facewash\n2. Reequil Ultra Matte Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n1. Garnier Micellar Water\n2a. Simple Refreshing Facewash\n2b. Minimalist 2% SA cleanser which I mix with Simple Cleanser on Sundays and Thursdays.\n3. Minimalist Tranexamic Acid Serum that I use on days I don't use SA Cleanser. \n4. Simple Hydrating Moisturiser mixed with pure aloe vera gel.\n5. Reequil 0.1% Retinol which I'm currently not using but planning on reintroducing on days without actives after my skin adjusts to the current routine.\n\nSunscreens I've used before:\n1. Lakme a canon event 😭\n2. Dot &amp; Key pink - not good fliters\n3. Dr Sheth - not good filters again\n4. Deconstruct gel sunscreen - liked the texture and matte finish but they changed the formulation and it started pilling\n5. Minimalist fluid sunscreen - really good protection as per this sub but looks really oily on my skin, for this weather, makes it look very dull and oily (would work out well for people in dry weather), stings my eyes.\nI don't prefer sunscreen that has a very dewy effect.\n\n6. Current - Reequil ultra matte sunscreen, I like this sunscreen, primer like texture, doesn't make my skin look greasy, doesn't sting, good protection, claims to be water resistant,  does break me out if I don't cleanse my skin well.\nI started reading from this sub that few people started experiencing darkening skintone and white dry patches, I did not notice much in my skin but I did feel like my skintone had changed slightly, not sure if it's tanning or the product or if I didn't apply it well. And I also read that this is a common issue with any silicone based sunscreen.\nI still like this sunscreen but wondering if it's good enough.\n\nI was looking at \n1. BOJ Aqua one - but many claimed it's not worth as they wouldn't spend that much on a sunscreen that is not water resistant.\n\n2. UV Doux - really hyped in this sub, but it is also a silicone based sunscreen, and I fear it is same as Reequil.\n\nWhat's your thoughts about this??\nSorry for the long post, I do yap a lot.",

In the shower when I start scrunching it looks quite nice but after the drying process (and especially the next day it looks terrible!) \n\nI usually start with brushing my hair before washing it. First I use shampoo I use the nutritive shampoo, hair mask and conditioner. I will detangle my hair while in the shower with the conditioner in. Then I will wash it out and start scrunching all the water out. After that I will use some hair gel (it’s a strong paste from a local hair dresser that I delude with some water to create a more creamy texture) and scrunch it into my hair after that I will use a towel and scrunch to get the excess water off. Then I try and diffuse my hair which is still a bit of process. After that I plop it into a t shirt and wait till the last bits dry and it sets and that’s how I end up here. Am i using the wrong products or should I use a different method? I saw some people use a comb and twirl the hair around that, is that more suited for curlier than wavy hair or the other way around? \nAnyways I’m super thankful for any suggestions or tips on how to deal with this mess.

Scalp Therapy (Micro-needling):\n Tiny needles create micro-injuries on the scalp.\nThis breaks down scar tissue, increases\noxygen, and wakes up stem cells to repair the follicle ecosystem.\n\n5. Red/Near Infrared Light Therapy:\nLight in the 630-850 nm wavelength range helps\nrepair the mitochondria (energy factories) in\nthe follicle cells, giving them the energy to\ngrow hair.\n\n6. Rosemary Oil: Improves scalp\ncirculation, reduces DHT, fights inflammation,\nand protects mitochondria-similar to some\nhair loss medications but natural.\n\n7. Best Hair-Growth Meal: \nLiver: Packed with bioavailable iron,\nzinc, and other essential minerals.\nOnions: High in quercetin, a powerful\nanti-inflammatory.\nSauerkraut: Excellent source of Vitamin C and phytonutrients.\nPumpkin Seeds: Great for magnesium\nand acting as a natural DHT blocker.\n\n\nConclusion:\nYou must fix the follicle's environment (like\nfixing the soil for a plant), not just block DHT.\nCombining these methods (especially\nfixing insulin resistance) is the most effective\nway to reverse hair loss naturally.",

I wanted to know if anybody had any tips to detangling them?\n\nRight now the routine is\nShampoo\n\nConditioner (sometimes it’s a repairing one that you leave in for a few minutes) and when I apply the conditioner is when I detangle my hair with a fine tooth comb. \n\nThen I put in \nLeave in conditioner, curl cream, gel, moouse. All of them I do prayer hands and scrunch and I finger curl the curl cream. \ni towel dry it and then let it air dry for a bit before defusing. \n\nI have hair just past my shoulders and it takes me over an hour to do without defusing or air drying and with detangling more than that.

      "content": "Hey everyone!\n\nI was looking at The Formularx moisturizers — specifically the Barrier Relief Lightweight Ceramide Moisturizer with Niacinamide and the Barrier Plus Peptide Ceramide Moisturizer — and noticed something that doesn’t quite add up.\n\nHere’s what I saw on their site:\n\n50g – ₹594\n\n100g – ₹721\n\n\nThat’s only about ₹127 more for double the quantity 😅\n\nBoth have the same 15% off + extra 5% offer and a free gift if you buy two. The price jump feels surprisingly small — usually 100g packs cost almost double or at least 1.8x, right?\n\nSo I’m wondering:\n\nIs this a typo or intentional?\n\nHas anyone bought both sizes — are they actually the same product and formula?\n\nDo they maybe use different packaging or batch formulas for the larger one?\n\n\nAlso, if you’ve tried both Barrier Relief and Barrier Plus, how do they compare in texture and finish? (I have combo-sensitive skin leaning oily, if that helps.)\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

I have to admit that the salon didnt apply heat protectant before blow drying it. Today I did a hot oil treatment and reshampooed. So now I’m devastated cuz my hair which is usually 3B/3C and very very curly at the bottom literally struggles to curl now a lot  parts look straight and now my whole hair looks like it’s 2a/2c with ends that barely curl.

I was thinking of just leaving it and accepting that it was a tiny bit underdeveloped (rather than cause extra damage by double-bleaching) but yesterday my mum spotted these really yellow spots at the back that DEFINITELY need fixing, so I think I just want all my roots fixed. I had my scalp bleach about 3-4 weeks ago so I've got a little bit of regrowth now, I'm not sure if it's best to wait for it to grow more or to get it fixed immediately?\n\nI went back to the salon and they ofc offered to fix, but they suggested it would be better to wait until the roots are more grown out and next ready for a scalp bleach. I looked it up online and it seems like the general consensus is fix underdeveloped roots ASAP, so I'm confused!

Hover then pixie diffuse to finish.\n\nI have tried to learned literally as much as I possibly can, like protein-moisture balance, etc. Still, no matter how much experimentation I try, my hair always ends up completely undefined and without shape. Basically just volume without definition, just constant bed head. I purposefully use less moisture and more protein because my hair is finer and has a looser curl pattern (and previously I felt as if my hair was experiencing moisture overload), but my hair is still just always limp and dull. When I scrunch out there crunch, my hair instantly frizzes up despite using a high-hold, humidity-resistant gel.\n\nI can't keep my hair overnight with a bonnet because that just doesn't work, and brush styling didn't work me either (not for a lack of effort or for doing it wrong - I sectioned my hair and everything, but brush styling is just not for my hair type.) I also don't want to come off as someone with waves that is trying to achieve curls, because I definitely have loose curls, they just have no definition whatsoever. Finally, the reason why I'm bothered by this is because my hair just completely covers my face, doing the exact opposite of framing it (you can't really tell because my face is covered I. photos but trust).

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been dealing with pigmentation for quite a long time now, especially on my forehead and cheeks. Over the past year, I’ve tried to stay consistent — using various skincare products I found after a lot of research on Instagram and other online sources. I’ve even used a few medicated products that were commonly recommended for pigmentation.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing has really worked for me. My skin still looks dull, uneven, and patchy. Every aesthetician I’ve consulted says it’s mainly sun damage, and that I might need to go for something like a Cosmelan peel or a professional treatment. But honestly, those are way beyond my budget right now.\n\nIt’s quite discouraging because I used to have clear, healthy-looking skin, and now it just feels like I’ve lost that glow. I’m looking for affordable and effective treatment options, or even simple product routines that might help improve my skin tone and texture gradually.\n\nIf anyone here has gone through something similar — sun damage, pigmentation, or post-inflammatory marks — and found something that actually worked (especially in the Indian climate), I’d really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThank you so much in advance 🙏",

      "title": "Could tightly curled \"type 4\" hair be stronger when wet?",
      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
