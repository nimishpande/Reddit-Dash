      "content": "I don‚Äôt really know how much  scalp is ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù to show but I try to show as little as possible. The first 3 pictures are what my hair looks like on a good day. I tried showing my bathroom lighting as well as more natural lighting. As you can see it‚Äôs very frizzy. I‚Äôm told it doesn‚Äôt look good/could look better but idk how to style it cause whenever I try to style it like videos on YouTube or try methods I read from the wiki where you just scrunch it then let it air dry or use a diffuser then scrunch it after it just looks like my entire scalp is showing so I might be doing something wrong or using the wrong products. The last 2 pictures are what it looks like when I attempt that. Side note I was thinking of trying texturing powder. Now I think it‚Äôs gotta be how I style it cause I think my hair is fine but many people tell me it's thick but I personally think it's due to how much volumizing I do but there is the possibility of me just doing or using something wrong like I said.\n\nRoutine:\nI'll use this routine 6 out of 7 days of the week with the seventh day being my shampoo day and the only significant difference is I use ‚Äúhask argon oil shampoo‚Äù before everything else.\nI use two conditioners I swap between every other day. One I use is ‚Äúliving proof full conditioner‚Äù and the other is a protein focused conditioner called ‚Äúcurl smith multitasking 3 in 1 conditioner‚Äù and I‚Äôll just rake those in my wet hair. Then like I said I‚Äôll use the living proof one day then the next I‚Äôll use the other instead.\n\nPost shower:\nAfter the shower I‚Äôve tried many things but the most consistent thing I‚Äôve been doing is I‚Äôll use ‚ÄúKristen ess lightweight leave in conditioner‚Äù and use the praying hands method for apply that going mid to ends, then I‚Äôll comb my hair down with an oval brush. Then I use a small amount of ‚ÄúAussie instant freeze hair gel with jojoba oil and sea kelp‚Äù rub that in my hands apply from roots to ends raking in then scrunch my hair at the ends and shake my head up and down gently to make it more natural.\n\nDrying and styling:\nThen I‚Äôll sit and wait for it to be completely dry then scrunch it and my scalp will show really bad especially at the crown and hairline probably because of how short my hair is (due to being in the military I can‚Äôt grow it out so growing it more isn‚Äôt an option at the moment). After that I‚Äôll use a hair pick to pick at the roots to mid lengths to help separate them and volumize it to make it look like the pictures. I know that this is likely the culprit to my issue but I don‚Äôt know how I should style it otherwise as the alternative is I look like I raided a crack shack. \n\nAny recommendations on what I should do differently to avoid showing too much scalp but not creating so much frizz or any products I should try like texturizing powder and if I should replace certain products with ones you recommend?",

      "title": "Dr Dennis Gross daily peel - universal vs ultra gentle",
      "content": "Hello!\n\nJust noticed that there were not any answered posts about the Dr Dennis Gross daily peels here and since I am an inconsistent user searching for some answers myself, thought I‚Äôd share my experience with you girlies ü•π\n\nSo they come in three types - ultra gentle, normal/universal, extra strength. I‚Äôve tried the first two types. Since I have sensitive skin I never thought of trying the extra strong ones. I would suggest to go for the normal one unless you have super sensitive skin (which I do) - then try the ultra gentle ones first.\n\nNow these are a two step routine thingy - steps are basically opening the pack and rubbing the cotton pad soaked in the essence on your face lol. So you wash your face, do first step (exfoliation), after couple of minutes do the second step (anti-ageing) and wait another two minutes before moisturizing.\n\nFirst off, yes, they are expensive. I have only gotten them by paying frens who have visited the States. But the only person I know IRL who uses them regularly is my best fren and she swears by it because she‚Äôs a PCOS girlie with angry skin. So I tried them and I am glad I did - even as someone who sucks at consistency, I do really like the effect it has on me even if I can use it for a few weeks on end. You can buy a ziploc pouch, cut each pad in half, and preserve the other half inside the package and ziploc for the next use. Cuz duh they‚Äôre expensive. \n\nSecondly, don‚Äôt start every day at first. Let your skin get used to it. When I used the orange peel for the first time I overexfoliated like a dumbass. Do it once or twice a week depending on how sensitive your skin is I guess at first. \n\nThird, don‚Äôt overdo rest of your actives. The peel pads contain Citric Acid, Lactic Acid, Malic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Retinol, Tocopheryl Acetate etc. Basically retinoids, AHA/BHA are already there in the peels so it might be wise not to use other exfoliants or strong acids in your routine if you‚Äôre using this! I didn‚Äôt realise this and coupled the peel with a cleanser that had AHA BHA PHA and my skin got so dry üò≠\n\nNext - ensure you use sunscreen! I can‚Äôt stress this enough. Because you _will_ get sunburnt if you don‚Äôt. I made this mistake once inspite of the packaging begging me to use sunscreen. Don‚Äôt be like me lol.\n\nLastly - MOISTURISE! The peel uses strong ingredients especially if you have sensitive skin like me so please for the love of god moisturise your skin girlllllll. I use 1.5-2x my usual moisturiser when I use the peel pads. \n\nAnyways, this was not a paid Dennis Gross advert lol. But I will try to be consistent and share the effects of the ultra gentle peel once I‚Äôve used it regularly for like a month or so. This is one of the only products where I‚Äôve felt a difference immediately after using it - almost feels like make up lol. The first set of photos is post using the normal peel and second set is using the ultra gentle peel. The rest of the steps were the same (washing face with a gentle cleanser like cetaphil then peel and then centella toner by skin1004 followed by bioderma sensibio pink moisturiser). Of course the quality of my skin is worse in the second set because the photos are taken months apart xD But I still wanted to share them for reference in case it might help somebody. ",

I am gonna book to get it cut and longest I'd leave it at is like slightly past my shoulder but like if anyone can tell me what I should/shouldn't be doing for whatever my hair type is and any product/routines to look into would be a MASSIVE help for me.

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm hoping someone has experienced the same thing as me, and may have any advice that could help me figure out how to take care of my hair.\n\nLately my hair has been feeling more thin and fragile than ever. I used to have think hair, in the sense that I had a lot of hair on my head, and ever since 2-3 years ago it has started to thin out and I don't recognise it anymore (due to stress most likely).\n\nI have been trying to determine my hair's porosity, and did some of the tests for it such as the sinking strand test and water bead. I put a completely clean strand of hair in a bowl with water and waited for about 15 minutes and it remained on top, which would indicate I have low porosity hair. I have also done the water bead test, where I put a drop of water on my hair, and it either fell off or stayed on top, not absorbing, unless I moved it, which would also indicate low porosity. \n\nFurthermore, I am desperately trying to always moisturise my ends, because they are constantly super dry, so I use a mixture of jojoba oil (as the carrier oil), and a very small amount of rosemary and vitamin E oil. I also put this oil mixture on my roots 2 hours before I wash. The oil usually stays on the hair or absorbs very slowly, and I also put it on my ends after washing, which makes my hair look a little greasy right after, when it should be clean and shiny.\n\nDespite all of this evidence that may point to low porosity hair, my ends are always super frizzy, dry, and fragile, I lose a lot of hair when brushing, and it is visibly thinning out, which may indicate high porosity. On the other hand, my roots get really greasy after just 2 or 3 days from the initial wash.\n\nThe worst part and most painful is the wet webbing I experience every single time I wash my hair. I have completely straight hair, and I can only find cases where this happens to wavy and curly hair, so I genuinely don't know how to stop this. Not to mention if I do anything with my hair after washing, it's so sensitive that I may pull on my scalp, which hurts for days after.\n\nI really don't know what to do and what products to use at this point, I have tried so many and I'm really tired and sad to keep spending money and not figuring out what I need.\n\nIf anyone has had a similar experience, please let me know what helped!",
