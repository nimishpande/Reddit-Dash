      "content": "I have very fine but dense curly/ wavy hair. It feels like every product I put on it is too heavy but also somehow drying.\n\nMy current routine (which I am not happy with) is Kristen Ess the gentle one shampoo and conditioner,  then I apply the wow dream coat and Miss Jessie’s gel to my soaking wet hair and I brush it through with a wide tooth comb. I then split it into two sections and my bangs and I apply not your mothers gel. I finger coil the pieces around my face and by my neck. I spray it with Sebastian shaper + hairspray then once it’s dry is scrunch out the crunch with Moroccan oil.\n\nMy hair usually looks ok on day one but there’s no conceivable way for me to get to a day 2 without refreshing in some way. My hair has no “longevity” if that makes sense. If I lean on it the wrong way my curl pattern just turns into frizz. I can’t diffuse it at all. I’ve tried so many different ways and it destroys my curl pattern and creates a very high level of frizz. My hair gets frizzy so easily and it kind of defaults to the texture of cotton candy. I’ve tried so so many products. All of the curly products that are moisturizing make my hair feel like straw and it impacts my curl pattern. \n\nDoes anyone have tips. I feel like having curly fine hair is so hard.",

      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Ive never gotten a haircut with hair longer than like, 1963 Paul Mccartney and also am not the type to put much thought into my appearance so Im lost but I like having hair this length because it feels cool while playing guitar (i play in a death metal band). Its frizzy as in the pictures about 80% of the time and i tend to tie it up when I go out somewhere that isnt a metal show or something. \n\nIm also recovering from a bad haircut my mom gave me (lol) so this is like 5 months of growth from that. I tried to show the messiness/frizz in full force in the pics so you people see the truth. When my hair isnt so messy i think it suits me well enough. Any advice on what to ask for in a cut and also what kind of products i should use to avoid the dull waxy feeling my hair tends to have that would be great. I already know I should avoid heavy ingredients like shea butter\n\n\nroutine:\n- clarify once a week with the cheap suave shampoo everyone uses\n- Condition with loreal everpure condioner \n- use either curl gel or pomade  depending on if i want to slick my hair back\n- air dry\n\n\n\n",

I’ve always been drawn to natural/herbal things like multani mitti and kumkumadi oil, but now that I’m older my skin definitely needs more structured help. I also can’t figure out my skin type and don’t really know what products or routine to follow.\n\nI recently went to a dermatologist (Harvard-trained). During the full skin exam he said everything looked fine. I mentioned that I don’t use sunscreen and he didn’t seem bothered at all, which surprised me. He leans more “integrative medicine,” so he spent more time talking about sleep and psychiatric issues rather than specific skincare recommendations. He ultimately told me to just apply a thin layer of coconut oil, which wasn’t what I expected.\n\nI was hoping for more concrete guidance — products, actives, supplements, or at least a proper routine.\n\nTo complicate things, he previously prescribed topical clindamycin and it caused severe burning in several spots. One area blistered badly (on my nose), peeled, and then scarred. I tried using Mederma on it and that made the peeling/redness much worse. I called the office before Thanksgiving but they were closed, so I finally have an appointment today. Thankfully the skin is improving, but I want to use today’s visit well.\n\nI’ll obviously tell him about the reaction, but beyond that I’m not sure what to ask to get actual guidance for a routine that’s safe and effective.\n\nWhat questions would you recommend I ask the dermatologist today?\n",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Styling products that are not very heavy are super drying for my hair... 😭😭😭🤸‍♀️\n\nFirst photo is my hair just washed, brushed and leave in conditioner (pretty bad day, but well, it shows the damage), second one is my hair styled.\n\nMy routine is not consistent with products really, since I try to find what works... If I wash daily, I use a moisturising shampoo, when every two-three days, I use a stronger one. I use protein/humectant conditioners and curl creams. Mousse don't last, I recently quit gel because it dried my hair so much. I also have a hair oil for my ends.

Before I was just brushing my hair and then since it becomes frizzy I’d layer it with tons of straightening/sleek de frizz products which I’m sure wasn’t doing any good to my hair and on top of that my hair was still frizzy no matter how much product I put on. After my hair stylist told me I have good curl/waves (she could tell even with all the frizz) I decided to go back to that routine. These pics are from about 2 weeks of doing the routine which is wash with Monday shampoo for curly hair and then function of beauty wavy conditioner I also used some Bobby brown strengthening conditioner and did some scrunching while I had conditioner on. And then when I was done in the shower I used Amika curl corp gel and instead of scrunching I just took each clump and cupped it in my hair and brought it up against my head and just kept it cupped in my hand against my head for a few seconds each and then let air dry. Ok that all being said I’m wanting my top layer to have some curl too so I think I need a repair mask or something? I think I have the whole “Irish curl” thing going on. I looked at my ancestry and a lot of it is Celtic ancestry which I think is really what Irish curl is just Celtic not just Irish. My hair I believe is fine course and maybe a medium porosity but I’m not super sure on porosity. I think my hair works better with light weight products. Can you all suggest some hair masks for repair and maybe moisture that would work with my hair and wave/curl type?",

I'm fine to shifting to Myntra for authenticity but it doesn't or rarely ever gives freebies.\n2. The total order price is lower on Purplle than Tira.\n3.

After trying different stuff, I started Accutane and completely cleared my skin from pimples.\nEverything went smooth but, fast forward to now 3 years later, I’m having some minor pimples.\n\nNothing like the ones I used to have but now I get like 1 week of decent skin and then like 3-4 pimples on the cheek area of my face. They stay for like a week slightly improving with my routine and then back again. I would sometimes randomly get worse If I were to shave off my beard completely, but usually It’s been like this for the past year.\n\nMy routine as of now consist in : \nCleanser AM/PM, moisturizer daily. \nEvery few days I use a scrub. \nBenzoyl peroxide 5% on spots during the day.\nAcid complex (salicylic, azelaic, mandelic)on spots for the whole night.\nI change cleanser and moisturizer every now and then.\n\n\nMY QUESTION IS : Would I be a good candidate for Adapalane to fix this “stubborn coming back every few weeks”  acne? \n\nI wanted to add something more “strong” to my routine and considered Bakuchiol / Retinol, but doing some research I found that these don’t help much with these spots and would rather need something like Differin.\n\nDoes anyone have some tips on whether or not I should begin using it? How bad is the purging and does it really last for months? \nAny other tips on how to add it in my routine?\n\nThanks a lot!",
