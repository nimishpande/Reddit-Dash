Sometimes I feel like all my features are “wrong”, including my curls. Why is everyone expected to look like Taylor Hill or Megan Fox? Why is their look considered “better”? On Reddit I was compared to them and rated a 6.5, and that I’m nowhere near a 10 like they are. I’ve been told in the past my rating would be higher if I had straight hair, too\n\nMy current routine: not your mother’s shampoo, conditioner, mousse. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\nThought I’d share my 4200-graft HT journey since this sub helped me so much when I was deciding what to do.\n\nI’d been thinning pretty fast in my late 20s. My hairline was almost gone and the mid-scalp wasn’t looking great either. After months of lurking here and stalking results, I ended up going with Dr. Heena Kudyar. A few people here had mentioned her, and I liked how natural her hairline designs looked.\n\n\nConsultation:\nSuper straightforward. She checked my donor, talked honestly about what could/couldn’t be fixed, and suggested around 4200 grafts to rebuild the hairline + add density through the front and mid-scalp. No pressure, no sales pitch.\n\n\nSurgery day:\nLong day but surprisingly chill. They drew the hairline (looked way better than anything I’d tried imagining myself), numbed me up, and the extraction/implantation was smooth. I was awake the whole time and the team kept checking if I was comfortable.\n\n\nRecovery:\nFirst two weeks were the usual paranoia: “Did I sleep wrong? Did I knock a graft out? Why do I look like I got head-butted by a goat?”\nBut everything healed normally.\nResults:\n\n\nMonths 3–4: sprouts\nMonths 5–6: big jump\nBy month 9, honestly… I couldn’t believe it.\n\nMy hairline looks natural, density is way better than I expected, and people who hadn’t seen me in a while literally thought I just “changed my hairstyle.”\nZero regrets.\n\nPosting because I know how scary it is to commit to 4k+ grafts. If you’re on the fence, I get it. Feel free to ask anything—happy to help someone the way this sub helped me.",

      "content": "hi everyone, like 2 months ago, i 19f got really really fucking sick and one of my symptoms was having really swollen eyes with (maybe tmi) discharge which really dried out my eyes especially since i didn’t have the energy to wash and moisturize my face regularly for a couple days. since then, my eyes has been on and off with the same exact dryness, mostly on. if the skin isn’t flaking, it’s tight, and if it is flaking, it stings and itches. any moisturizer makes it sting like crazy some of the time and since i do regular full faces of makeup, it makes my makeup look bad😭. i’ve always had sensitive and mostly dry skin, and have gotten dry patches under my eyes in the past but never to this extent. literally regardless of how much i moisturize or use eye cream with aloe or slug my eyes with vaseline nightly, they stay the same. i found that the one time they went back to normal for an extended amount of time was the week i came home from college and didn’t have my regular products and was also not washing my face as much (college student burnout lol). as soon as i got back to my regular routine, my eyes immediately went back to that dry state. does anyone know what’s going on and how to treat it? for my past dry patches, i was prescribed some ointment by my dermatologist but it’s been some years and my family’s current financial and insurance situation isn’t good so i can’t go to that derm. would appreciate any tips to help with this, thanks!! (3rd pic was when i was recovering from being sick with a little eye discharge)",

In hindsight should have bought 40 vol too and mixed it with the 20 I guess :/)\nAnyway. I did this on virgin hair.\nCan't see the colour, didnt lift much. Unless I stand directly under a potlight. I can tell it was the right shade though but it just didnt lift much of the natural black colour and deposited dye to dark hair so you cant see it. Even in daytime have to look very hard or at certain angles but barely.\nI 100% want to avoid bleach bc I know it'll end up touching my skin and burning me, that's why I did this process but didn't know I only had one shot at it, if that's the case, bc hair isn't virgin anymore. Not that the instructions said virgin hair is needed it just said use on naturally dark hair but didn't say anything about whether it'll work on previously dyed hair or not. Like naturally dark hair that has already been dyed. \n\nI got 40vol developer now. \n\nQuestions:\n1. Can it work if I try to redo the process with stronger developer or is it not going to work bc the hair is no longer virgin? Like what does naturally dark mean, natural=virgin or simply referring to the natural base colour it'll work for regardless of dye?\n2. What if I use anti-dye? Does that help return hair closer to \"virgin\" hair? Is this something I should do? \n3. Will it help to wait a month like wait a few washes for the dye to fade out a bit? \n\nThanks for your help guys! \n",

If you can put a tissue paper or something light on your face and it sticks or gets oily then you have oily skin, if your face gets tight during those 30 mins then you have dry skin, and then I guess if it doesn’t get tight and doesn’t have oil on the tissue u have normal skin. \n\nMy question is for someone whos been trying routines and actives without having figured out my skin type with certainty, how do I know I’m getting an accurate tell of what my skin type actually is right now or if it’s just how my skin is reacting due to actives. \n\nLike for example I don’t think I have dry skin yet when o washed and dried my face I noticed it starting to feel tight. Does that mean I have dry skin or is that th affect of the actives I’ve been using in my routine (tret). Tonight I applied mandelic acid for fist time and last night I tried a clay mask for the fist time but think I left it on for too long",

      "content": "I recently discovered I had wavy hair after being one of those poofy straight hair people my whole life. Basic rundown on my hair, it is quite wavy after being freshly washed, but if it air dries (which I usually do) it turns poofy straight with a few bends here and there. It's pretty low porosity with fine strands (asian hair). Like I said, after watching a few TikToks I realized my hair might actually be wavy, so I've been trying to bring out the waves rather than brushing it out.\n\nSince I'm not exactly sure how wavy my hair is yet, I haven't bought styling products yet because I'm still doing my research. So for now, I've just been using leave in conditioner (Moroccan Oil brand), squeezing a bit of that into my hands, and then scrunching up my hair. The thing is, when I do that (or when my hair is scrunched even with no product), my hair makes really nice wavy little curl casts and it actually looks good (and like the tutorials I've been using show). However, as my hair dries, it starts straightening out and losing the cast and I just end up with either the bendy straight hair again or some weird half wave situation. I tried diffusing, same thing happened.\n\nThe weird thing is, when I style my hair with a wavy hair routine, it ends up straight but not poofy like it does when I don't style it.\n\nI'm super confused right now and I need some advice on how to get my waves to hold as they dry.\n\n  \n",
