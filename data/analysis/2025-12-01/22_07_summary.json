      "content": "I have very fine but dense curly/ wavy hair. It feels like every product I put on it is too heavy but also somehow drying.\n\nMy current routine (which I am not happy with) is Kristen Ess the gentle one shampoo and conditioner,  then I apply the wow dream coat and Miss Jessie’s gel to my soaking wet hair and I brush it through with a wide tooth comb. I then split it into two sections and my bangs and I apply not your mothers gel. I finger coil the pieces around my face and by my neck. I spray it with Sebastian shaper + hairspray then once it’s dry is scrunch out the crunch with Moroccan oil.\n\nMy hair usually looks ok on day one but there’s no conceivable way for me to get to a day 2 without refreshing in some way. My hair has no “longevity” if that makes sense. If I lean on it the wrong way my curl pattern just turns into frizz. I can’t diffuse it at all. I’ve tried so many different ways and it destroys my curl pattern and creates a very high level of frizz. My hair gets frizzy so easily and it kind of defaults to the texture of cotton candy. I’ve tried so so many products. All of the curly products that are moisturizing make my hair feel like straw and it impacts my curl pattern. \n\nDoes anyone have tips. I feel like having curly fine hair is so hard.",

      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

However, I recently noticed a few curls after washing my hair and I think my hair is changing (maybe due to hormonal changes) and so I’m trying to figure out if my hair is now wavy/curly. \n\nThe picture on the left is natural hair, no products and air dried. It’s not sleek the way it used to be and definitely feels a little more frizzy and looks kind of puffy when I brush it out. \n\nRoutine:\n\nFor my shampoo, I use Pantene miracle moisture boost. \n\nThe middle one has a dime sized amount of Garnier pure clean styling gel. I rubbed it between my hands and ran them down my hair (damp, not soaking wet). Then I scrunched and diffused until dry. \n\nThe picture on the right is with Pantene soft curls shaping mousse. I added about a golf ball sized amount to soaking wet hair, combed it through with my finger, scrunched and diffused until dry. \n\nIt’s hard to see in the pictures but I feel like my hair looked curlier with mousse than gel but the mousse made it look greasy. \n\nI’ve also tried Pantene wave and curl defining hydrating crème but that just makes my hair soft without really defining any of the waves/curls. \n\nI use a satin pillowcase, no bonnet.

Ive never gotten a haircut with hair longer than like, 1963 Paul Mccartney and also am not the type to put much thought into my appearance so Im lost but I like having hair this length because it feels cool while playing guitar (i play in a death metal band). Its frizzy as in the pictures about 80% of the time and i tend to tie it up when I go out somewhere that isnt a metal show or something. \n\nIm also recovering from a bad haircut my mom gave me (lol) so this is like 5 months of growth from that. I tried to show the messiness/frizz in full force in the pics so you people see the truth. When my hair isnt so messy i think it suits me well enough. Any advice on what to ask for in a cut and also what kind of products i should use to avoid the dull waxy feeling my hair tends to have that would be great. I already know I should avoid heavy ingredients like shea butter\n\n\nroutine:\n- clarify once a week with the cheap suave shampoo everyone uses\n- Condition with loreal everpure condioner \n- use either curl gel or pomade  depending on if i want to slick my hair back\n- air dry\n\n\n\n",

First of all, thank you for being on this sub, I come here regularly to get advice but now I'm at a loss.\n\nI've always had a ruddy complexion. This year, I've started to level up to improve my appearance. Although mostly it's fine, one thing that has eluded me is the redness in my face. I'm outdoors a lot, so during the summer I wear sunscreen and don't seem to have problems. Now that it's cold here (SE USA) and drier than usual (I like my humidity, and so does my skin!), I feel like my cheeks are out of control (and in a bad way).\n\nSo, I'm still outside a lot (walking, hiking, etc.), so I've started to wear sunscreen every day. My dermatologist recommend La Roche Posay moisturizer with SPF, so I added that to my routine. Additionally, I got the DearKlairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream to wear at night.\n\nThe problem is... the redness is worsening. I haven't had acne in years, and never on my forehead, and now all the sudden these red bumps are popping up on my forehead. Plus, it doesn't seem like either of these things is actually helping to moisturize. My skin still feels dry, inflamed, and is redder than it normally is.\n\nI guess my question is: those of you who have experienced this, what do you do? How do you calm reddened skin in the winter without breaking out too? Personally, it's seeming like my minimal skin care routine (castile soap with pure coconut oil after) was working better than the current one, despite not having sunscreen. Please help! What steps would you take? What would your routine look like? Thank you!",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

So I'm confused if I should just get him the pilgrim serum again or any other serums.

Styling products that are not very heavy are super drying for my hair... 😭😭😭🤸‍♀️\n\nFirst photo is my hair just washed, brushed and leave in conditioner (pretty bad day, but well, it shows the damage), second one is my hair styled.\n\nMy routine is not consistent with products really, since I try to find what works... If I wash daily, I use a moisturising shampoo, when every two-three days, I use a stronger one. I use protein/humectant conditioners and curl creams. Mousse don't last, I recently quit gel because it dried my hair so much. I also have a hair oil for my ends.

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m a 19-year-old guy and I’ve been dealing with persistent acne/pimples/scarring mainly on my forehead and temples.\n\nI originally thought it was because my hair was long, so I cut it really short about a month ago, but the breakouts stayed the same or even got worse.\n\nFor background: I used to have acne when I was younger and Dr Organic tea tree face wash helped back then. Now I mostly just get the occasional cheek pimple. I think I might have seb derm on my scalp but Nizoral has helped a lot. I currently use Dove Daily Moisture shampoo along with Nizoral, CeraVe moisturiser after showering, and I wash my face with a Dove bar soap (been using that my whole life).\n\nMy diet hasn’t been great recently, but even when it was good I still kept getting cyst-like bumps on my temples. I wear glasses and clean them often. I change my pillowcase regularly. I do pick/pop at them (I know I should stop but it’s difficult).\n\nJust looking for advice on what might be causing forehead/temple breakouts like this and what I can do to fix it. Thanks.",

A month of using it and my pigmentation genuinely started fading off. They dont sell the old version anymore.\n\nI have tried aqualogica (burns and breaking me out), re'equil (too thick, I've got dry skin). Idk what to switch to rn.\n\nPeople are recommending me beauty of joseon but Im kinda contemplating cause its 1300.  \nIve heard good reviews about episoft but I heard it doesnt really provide any protection.  \nUV Doux and Acne UV have a silicone mousse texture which Idt I'm looking for as my skin is already dry and its winter.\n\nPlease please please help me out with your recs.  \nAlso if you've got similar experiences with neutrogena, what did you switch to?",

Before I was just brushing my hair and then since it becomes frizzy I’d layer it with tons of straightening/sleek de frizz products which I’m sure wasn’t doing any good to my hair and on top of that my hair was still frizzy no matter how much product I put on. After my hair stylist told me I have good curl/waves (she could tell even with all the frizz) I decided to go back to that routine. These pics are from about 2 weeks of doing the routine which is wash with Monday shampoo for curly hair and then function of beauty wavy conditioner I also used some Bobby brown strengthening conditioner and did some scrunching while I had conditioner on. And then when I was done in the shower I used Amika curl corp gel and instead of scrunching I just took each clump and cupped it in my hair and brought it up against my head and just kept it cupped in my hand against my head for a few seconds each and then let air dry. Ok that all being said I’m wanting my top layer to have some curl too so I think I need a repair mask or something? I think I have the whole “Irish curl” thing going on. I looked at my ancestry and a lot of it is Celtic ancestry which I think is really what Irish curl is just Celtic not just Irish. My hair I believe is fine course and maybe a medium porosity but I’m not super sure on porosity. I think my hair works better with light weight products. Can you all suggest some hair masks for repair and maybe moisture that would work with my hair and wave/curl type?",

I do see people struggling really bad with their hairfall, and I was one of them as well. Now that it's 2025 , but hair is dense. And got volume and is shiny. Now what helped?\n\n1) I changed my oil.\nI used to apply coconut oil only , now I apply rosemary oil on my scalp and on the other parts I apply coconut oil.\n2) rosemary water\nI started applying rosemary + clove + Fenugreek seeds( boil them in a cup of water for 15 minutes , let it cool down , store em in a spray bottle and use it for 1 week. Save half of the batch of water by making em in ice cubes so that it could be used later.)\nI KID YOU NOT IT HELPED ALOT!!! I applied it 2 times a day and it was a game changer!!!\n\n3) changed my shampoo.\nI used clinic plus earlier then from my friend's suggestion I use loreal hyluron shampoo ( not sponsored or anything).\n\nPlease try these methods and trust me you will see the change! Be consistent while doing it.",

      "content": "I am looking for skincare advice out of pure desperation at this point.\n\nI have had moderate-ish acne off and on since I was a kid (F, now early 20s, US), all in my T-zone with lots of redness. I have combination skin that leans more toward the oily side. My routine is pretty simple (by design) because I have touchy skin: I just use Vanicream Gentle facial cleanser and Cerave daily moisturizing lotion twice daily. I have an rx for tretinoin 0.1% that I use at night and have been prescribed for a couple years, but my skin basically refuses to respond to anything topical (unless it's pissing it off more). I tried using it before the moisturizer for a few days and that did not go well, so I'm doing cleanser, moisturizer, then tret at night currently.\n\nWhile some of it is definitely hormonal, my current birth control is not something that I'm willing to get off of in the near future because it has had such a tremendous impact on my mood and no *worsening* of my acne.\n\nAccutane was a godsend once my derm said she had no other options and I agreed to it. My skin looked GOOD for the first time in my adult life. It helped with oiliness and didn't dry me out too much, but a couple years after finishing the course, it feels like I'm back to square 1. I am looking into restarting it, but that's it's own struggle (gotta love American healthcare).\n\nNOTE that I have tried literally every topical treatment you can think of... adapalene, benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, salicylic acid... nothing touches it or even dries me out much. I've done spironolactone and antibiotics... and nothing works. My diet is considered healthy and I already have celiac so I can't afford to cut anything else out. At this point I'm just trying to not piss it off MORE because I've lost hope trying to treat it locally.\n\nIs there anything in my routine that could be improved considering I'm staying on tretinoin for the time being (so no other exfoliants)? I can't afford anything expensive but obviously what I'm doing now isn't working very well, so I'm open to ideas.\n\nThanks:)",

Its not red spots or slight redness but full on red skin in the area where the cyst was.\n\nI am using a hydrocortisone cream (1%) but I don't want to cause any kind of damage by using it anymore since it can cause skin thinning in that area which already seems damaged.\n\ndoes anyone know what I can use or do to make the redness go away?\n\nAlso, I have not started using a retinoid yet but I was given Tretinoin 0.05 by my doctor. Does anyone know if I can start using it now or does the redness need to go away fully first?\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

In the Netherlands minoxidil is available without a prescription, but finasteride isn’t.\n\nI intentionally waited to start finasteride because my partner and I had a desire to have children. Now that this is no longer a concern, I figured it was time to finally begin.\n\nHowever, the dermatologist refused to prescribe it. He said that very recent research (&lt;1 year old) showed worrying results regarding male breast cancer as a side effect. According to him, depression was still “manageable” because they could monitor that, but the breast-cancer findings caused him — and apparently the entire medical team in my region — to completely stop prescribing finasteride.\n\nHe also mentioned hearing at a conference about a finasteride topical lotion that includes 15% minoxidil, which he suggested as an alternative. That sounded like overkill to me and honestly made me question his knowledge a bit. He also said there was no difference between dutasteride and finasteride in terms of side effects or their frequency, which added to my doubts.\n\nObviously I assume a doctor should know more than someone like me who gathers info online, but the whole consultation left me feeling like he might not be fully informed on hair loss treatments.\n\nMy question to you all:\nHas anyone heard about this supposed recent study linking finasteride to increased male breast cancer risk? I can’t find anything about it anywhere.\n\nThanks in advance.",
