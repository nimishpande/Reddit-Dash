      "content": "I have very fine but dense curly/ wavy hair. It feels like every product I put on it is too heavy but also somehow drying.\n\nMy current routine (which I am not happy with) is Kristen Ess the gentle one shampoo and conditioner,  then I apply the wow dream coat and Miss Jessie’s gel to my soaking wet hair and I brush it through with a wide tooth comb. I then split it into two sections and my bangs and I apply not your mothers gel. I finger coil the pieces around my face and by my neck. I spray it with Sebastian shaper + hairspray then once it’s dry is scrunch out the crunch with Moroccan oil.\n\nMy hair usually looks ok on day one but there’s no conceivable way for me to get to a day 2 without refreshing in some way. My hair has no “longevity” if that makes sense. If I lean on it the wrong way my curl pattern just turns into frizz. I can’t diffuse it at all. I’ve tried so many different ways and it destroys my curl pattern and creates a very high level of frizz. My hair gets frizzy so easily and it kind of defaults to the texture of cotton candy. I’ve tried so so many products. All of the curly products that are moisturizing make my hair feel like straw and it impacts my curl pattern. \n\nDoes anyone have tips. I feel like having curly fine hair is so hard.",

      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

His skin has some dark sun spots due to the nature of his work/job.\n\nFew days ago he used the pilgrim 10% vitamin c serum and he really liked it, says it gave him some kind of result, but personally I'm skeptical about this brand and so got him the deconstruct niacinamide + alpha arbutin serum but we did not see much changes in his skin after using this serum. So I'm confused if I should just get him the pilgrim serum again or any other serums. And any other suggestions or recommendations would also be thankful.\n\nPS: I did got him to use sunscreen everyday now so his skin looks good not completely repaired.",

I am at a loss on what to do, everyone says I always look tired. I'm not the best with makeup yet, so every time apply it under my eyes, it ends up creasing and having lines where my wrinkles are when I smile.\n\nDoes anyone have advice to get rid of these eye bags? I feel my eyes are like sunken in? Somebody told me I have deep set eyes so I worry that nothing I do will be able to change the appearance of them because there's always shadows under my eyes that make it look worse when I stand in certain lighting.\nI have had bad chalazions in the past and needed surgery to remove one, which has made it so there's always a slight puffiness around my eyelid that makes me insecure. Also I tried doing the pinch test and the darkness goes away which I pinch my eyes?\n\nWhich people are saying to use a retinal eye cream for, but I'm also hearing retinal is extremely bad to use around your eyes? would just like some advice please.\n",

If I wash daily, I use a moisturising shampoo, when every two-three days, I use a stronger one. I use protein/humectant conditioners and curl creams. Mousse don't last, I recently quit gel because it dried my hair so much. I also have a hair oil for my ends.

Before I was just brushing my hair and then since it becomes frizzy I’d layer it with tons of straightening/sleek de frizz products which I’m sure wasn’t doing any good to my hair and on top of that my hair was still frizzy no matter how much product I put on. After my hair stylist told me I have good curl/waves (she could tell even with all the frizz) I decided to go back to that routine. These pics are from about 2 weeks of doing the routine which is wash with Monday shampoo for curly hair and then function of beauty wavy conditioner I also used some Bobby brown strengthening conditioner and did some scrunching while I had conditioner on. And then when I was done in the shower I used Amika curl corp gel and instead of scrunching I just took each clump and cupped it in my hair and brought it up against my head and just kept it cupped in my hand against my head for a few seconds each and then let air dry. Ok that all being said I’m wanting my top layer to have some curl too so I think I need a repair mask or something? I think I have the whole “Irish curl” thing going on. I looked at my ancestry and a lot of it is Celtic ancestry which I think is really what Irish curl is just Celtic not just Irish. My hair I believe is fine course and maybe a medium porosity but I’m not super sure on porosity. I think my hair works better with light weight products. Can you all suggest some hair masks for repair and maybe moisture that would work with my hair and wave/curl type?",

I do have quite a number of blackheads on my nose, and weirdly my skin is both oily and dry at varying times. Also bad dark circles around the eyes though that's probably due to my sleep.\n\nUp until now, facecare has literally been daily water and one of the basic nivea face washes every couple days.\n\n*Since reading around this subreddit, I have purchased the following finally:*\n\n\\&gt;&gt; La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Ultra-Light Invisible Sunscreen for Sensitive Skin SPF50+\n\n\\&gt;&gt; CeraVe Blemish Control Face Cleanser with 2% Salicylic Acid &amp; Niacinamide\n\n\\&gt;&gt; Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel Oil-Free\n\n\n\nAm I missing anything obvious?

Ive never gotten a haircut with hair longer than like, 1963 Paul Mccartney and also am not the type to put much thought into my appearance so Im lost but I like having hair this length because it feels cool while playing guitar (i play in a death metal band). Its frizzy as in the pictures about 80% of the time and i tend to tie it up when I go out somewhere that isnt a metal show or something. \n\nIm also recovering from a bad haircut my mom gave me (lol) so this is like 5 months of growth from that. I tried to show the messiness/frizz in full force in the pics so you people see the truth. When my hair isnt so messy i think it suits me well enough. Any advice on what to ask for in a cut and also what kind of products i should use to avoid the dull waxy feeling my hair tends to have that would be great. I already know I should avoid heavy ingredients like shea butter\n\n\nroutine:\n- clarify once a week with the cheap suave shampoo everyone uses\n- Condition with loreal everpure condioner \n- use either curl gel or pomade  depending on if i want to slick my hair back\n- air dry\n\n\n\n",

It's mostly on the front of my scalp and in the middle and I think this is causing a lot of hair loss and thinning. I can't even mess with my hair in public because of my dandruff, it's never like small bits of dandruff but is big flakes like the size of a pea or larger. I just use whatever shampoo, but recently I've just been using water because shampoo seems to make it worst probably because its the wrong stuff. So I'm hoping someone can save me by suggesting me a shampoo or some serum/oils that will get rid of this. I'm sure theres some medical term to whats wrong with my scalp, no clue but it does get irritated sometimes/itchy.\n\nIf there is also anything I can pair with this to help with my hair thinning and hairloss would be great too.
