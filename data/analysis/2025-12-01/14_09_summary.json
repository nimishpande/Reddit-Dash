      "content": "I have very fine but dense curly/ wavy hair. It feels like every product I put on it is too heavy but also somehow drying.\n\nMy current routine (which I am not happy with) is Kristen Ess the gentle one shampoo and conditioner,  then I apply the wow dream coat and Miss Jessie’s gel to my soaking wet hair and I brush it through with a wide tooth comb. I then split it into two sections and my bangs and I apply not your mothers gel. I finger coil the pieces around my face and by my neck. I spray it with Sebastian shaper + hairspray then once it’s dry is scrunch out the crunch with Moroccan oil.\n\nMy hair usually looks ok on day one but there’s no conceivable way for me to get to a day 2 without refreshing in some way. My hair has no “longevity” if that makes sense. If I lean on it the wrong way my curl pattern just turns into frizz. I can’t diffuse it at all. I’ve tried so many different ways and it destroys my curl pattern and creates a very high level of frizz. My hair gets frizzy so easily and it kind of defaults to the texture of cotton candy. I’ve tried so so many products. All of the curly products that are moisturizing make my hair feel like straw and it impacts my curl pattern. \n\nDoes anyone have tips. I feel like having curly fine hair is so hard.",

      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I’m 27, I came off the contraceptive pill in December last year and my skin has completely changed as a result. I feel like I’m going through puberty all over again! All year I’ve been desperately trying to figure out what skincare works for my now oily and congested skin.\n\nAbout 4 weeks ago I was using retinol night cream daily and AHA/BHA face wash in the morning. Turns out I’m too young to use retinol and I was overdoing it so after 8-12 weeks of use I ended up with more spots than before.\n\nI stopped using retinol and just continued with the AHA/BHA face wash once a day.\n\nThis is my current daily routine: \n\n**Morning**\n1. Single cleanse: Facetheory ClariCleanse AHA &amp; BHA Exfoliating Cleanser\n2. The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% Plumping Serum\n3. Facetheory Glow-C Eye Cream\n4. Facetheory Glow-C Daily Moisturiser SPF 30 (contains niacinamide and vitamin C)\n\n**Night**\n1. Double cleanse: The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser and Glucoside Foaming Cleanser\n2. The Inkey List Niacinamide serum\n3. Facetheory Blemicalm Azelaic Acid 15% Clarifying Serum (only once a week)\n4. The Ordinary Natural Moisturising Factors + HA (lightweight moisturiser)\n\n**Context**\nAt the moment my skin is just congested with blackheads and has a few leftover spots from overdoing the retinol. My forehead gets pretty greasy throughout the day and is really oily first thing in the morning. I have multiple new blackheads daily and have been squeezing them (which I know I shouldn’t 🙈). I only wear makeup about once a week.\n\nAm I still doing too much? I’m wondering if I should cut out the AHA/BHA face wash and azelaic acid for a while (maybe a week or two weeks) and then start just using them maybe once or twice a week instead. Do I also need to cut out the vitamin C? If so, can anyone recommend a good sunscreen for oily skin?",

I do have quite a number of blackheads on my nose, and weirdly my skin is both oily and dry at varying times. Also bad dark circles around the eyes though that's probably due to my sleep.\n\nUp until now, facecare has literally been daily water and one of the basic nivea face washes every couple days.\n\n*Since reading around this subreddit, I have purchased the following finally:*\n\n\\&gt;&gt; La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Ultra-Light Invisible Sunscreen for Sensitive Skin SPF50+\n\n\\&gt;&gt; CeraVe Blemish Control Face Cleanser with 2% Salicylic Acid &amp; Niacinamide\n\n\\&gt;&gt; Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel Oil-Free\n\n\n\nAm I missing anything obvious?

So I'm confused if I should just get him the pilgrim serum again or any other serums.
