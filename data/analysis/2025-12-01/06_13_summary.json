Sometimes people tell me I need to straighten my hair or dye it a different color to look better. I’ve even been told I look old fashioned for having curly hair. Honestly? Sometimes I feel like all my features are “wrong”, including my curls. Why is everyone expected to look like Taylor Hill or Megan Fox? Why is their look considered “better”? On Reddit I was compared to them and rated a 6.5, and that I’m nowhere near a 10 like they are. I’ve been told in the past my rating would be higher if I had straight hair, too\n\nMy current routine: not your mother’s shampoo, conditioner, mousse. ",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\nThought I’d share my 4200-graft HT journey since this sub helped me so much when I was deciding what to do.\n\nI’d been thinning pretty fast in my late 20s. My hairline was almost gone and the mid-scalp wasn’t looking great either. After months of lurking here and stalking results, I ended up going with Dr. Heena Kudyar. A few people here had mentioned her, and I liked how natural her hairline designs looked.\n\n\nConsultation:\nSuper straightforward. She checked my donor, talked honestly about what could/couldn’t be fixed, and suggested around 4200 grafts to rebuild the hairline + add density through the front and mid-scalp. No pressure, no sales pitch.\n\n\nSurgery day:\nLong day but surprisingly chill. They drew the hairline (looked way better than anything I’d tried imagining myself), numbed me up, and the extraction/implantation was smooth. I was awake the whole time and the team kept checking if I was comfortable.\n\n\nRecovery:\nFirst two weeks were the usual paranoia: “Did I sleep wrong? Did I knock a graft out?

I am after some help for things I can do / products I can use, as well as figuring out what type of acne this is.\n\nFactors that haven’t helped = Being active &amp; not showering right after exercise, not washing clothes / sheets regularly enough, sometimes not wearing breathable clothing, dandruff, oily skin.\n\nOver the counter products I have at the moment = Benzac 5%, micellar water, hydrocolloid patches.\n\nI have been to the doctor twice, where I was prescribed tretinoin (retrieve), which I haven’t really seen much improvement using and doxycycline (100mg) later on, which I have not taken yet.\n\nThe second doctor was not helpful, essentially just prescribed and didn’t say anything else. It was only the helpful pharmacist and my further research which made me realise the potential impacts of doxycycline.\n\nSo my questions are: What kind of acne is this? What over the counter products can I buy that may help &amp; how to use them? Is doxycycline worth taking for my acne?\n\nThanks everyone for your help",

      "content": "Overall skincare HELP!!\n\n22f here! I’d say that my skin is **for the most part** not too problematic. I’ll occasionally get some pimples here and there, usually right before my period, and sometimes (maybe every few months or so) I’ll get a random white head somewhere that’s unrelated to my period. My main concern is aging + my sunken under eyes. I feel like my skin makes me look older than my age, and worsened by my under eye bags. Since I’m white pale, my bags are blue-ish, but just very sunk in near my nose. I’m wanting to up my skincare game and I need your help!! My skin gets dry VERY easily. \n\nMy daily routine consists of washing my face usually once a day (in the morning or afternoon) with cerave hydrating cleanse and then I’ll put my prescribed taro adapalene benzoyl peroxide 2.5% +0.1% gel, and then finish with my cetaphil moisturizing cream. I don’t use anything else, no serums, no under eye products, no sunscreen, etc… as well, I never wear makeup so I guess it helps with not needing hard products to wash it off. I’m looking for advice on how to better my skincare whilst also addressing my skin not looking too aged + my under eye bags.. BTW my skin is pretty sensitive which is why I stick to these few products because it’s the routine that’s caused the least breakouts + non dry skin ",

In hindsight should have bought 40 vol too and mixed it with the 20 I guess :/)\nAnyway. I did this on virgin hair.\nCan't see the colour, didnt lift much. Unless I stand directly under a potlight. I can tell it was the right shade though but it just didnt lift much of the natural black colour and deposited dye to dark hair so you cant see it. Even in daytime have to look very hard or at certain angles but barely.\nI 100% want to avoid bleach bc I know it'll end up touching my skin and burning me, that's why I did this process but didn't know I only had one shot at it, if that's the case, bc hair isn't virgin anymore. Not that the instructions said virgin hair is needed it just said use on naturally dark hair but didn't say anything about whether it'll work on previously dyed hair or not. Like naturally dark hair that has already been dyed. \n\nI got 40vol developer now. \n\nQuestions:\n1. Can it work if I try to redo the process with stronger developer or is it not going to work bc the hair is no longer virgin? Like what does naturally dark mean, natural=virgin or simply referring to the natural base colour it'll work for regardless of dye?\n2. What if I use anti-dye? Does that help return hair closer to \"virgin\" hair? Is this something I should do? \n3. Will it help to wait a month like wait a few washes for the dye to fade out a bit? \n\nThanks for your help guys! \n",

      "content": "I recently discovered I had wavy hair after being one of those poofy straight hair people my whole life. Basic rundown on my hair, it is quite wavy after being freshly washed, but if it air dries (which I usually do) it turns poofy straight with a few bends here and there. It's pretty low porosity with fine strands (asian hair). Like I said, after watching a few TikToks I realized my hair might actually be wavy, so I've been trying to bring out the waves rather than brushing it out.\n\nSince I'm not exactly sure how wavy my hair is yet, I haven't bought styling products yet because I'm still doing my research. So for now, I've just been using leave in conditioner (Moroccan Oil brand), squeezing a bit of that into my hands, and then scrunching up my hair. The thing is, when I do that (or when my hair is scrunched even with no product), my hair makes really nice wavy little curl casts and it actually looks good (and like the tutorials I've been using show). However, as my hair dries, it starts straightening out and losing the cast and I just end up with either the bendy straight hair again or some weird half wave situation. I tried diffusing, same thing happened.\n\nThe weird thing is, when I style my hair with a wavy hair routine, it ends up straight but not poofy like it does when I don't style it.\n\nI'm super confused right now and I need some advice on how to get my waves to hold as they dry.\n\n  \n",

Now my skin barrier is fucked so I’m back to cleanser, moisturize, and sunblock. \n\nI drink tons of water, I try to eat healthy, I try to physically be healthy. I wash my face at night with lukewarm water. I wear sunblock everyday. What else should I even be doing ????\n\nFor reference, my skin type is oily acne prone.

      "content": "Hey. I'm a 23 year old guy who has been having some hair issues lately. For the last 2 years I've been losing more hair than before, especially during the winter. For about a month, it felt as if I lost several strands of hair every time I ran my fingers through my hair. I've always had a naturally high hairline, but I'm almost sure it has receded a bit because it also looks very thin in the area. I went to the doctor and he said he noticed thinning towards the front of my scalp but couldn't say for sure that it was male pattern hair loss. He had me take a blood test which showed I'm low on folic acid, which he told me can also cause hair loss. I explained that I'm afraid of my hair permanently deteriorating further in case it isn't the folic acid, so he prescribed me 1mg Finasteride and some folic acid supplement to cover every basis. Is there any way to definitively tell what kind of hair loss it might be? Does this sound like a good plan? The side effects of Finasteride scare me but I really care about my hair.",

If you can put a tissue paper or something light on your face and it sticks or gets oily then you have oily skin, if your face gets tight during those 30 mins then you have dry skin, and then I guess if it doesn’t get tight and doesn’t have oil on the tissue u have normal skin. \n\nMy question is for someone whos been trying routines and actives without having figured out my skin type with certainty, how do I know I’m getting an accurate tell of what my skin type actually is right now or if it’s just how my skin is reacting due to actives. \n\nLike for example I don’t think I have dry skin yet when o washed and dried my face I noticed it starting to feel tight. Does that mean I have dry skin or is that th affect of the actives I’ve been using in my routine (tret). Tonight I applied mandelic acid for fist time and last night I tried a clay mask for the fist time but think I left it on for too long",

So I just purchased this hair oil and I thought it was okay since I didn’t see any tree nuts or peanuts in the ingredients label. However, as I rubbed a small amount onto my hand, it started feeling tingly. And unfortunately, it had almond oil but under another name (Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis). 🫠 I genuinely don’t understand how they aren’t required to properly warn their consumers of any potential allergens in their products especially if they’re labeling it under a different name like this could literally kill someone 😭",

On my back, I sometimes get black, worm like plugs that come out… I think it’s blackheads \nI also have a little bit of sebum plugs on my cheek area, plus small bumps, uneven texture, and red/dark marks on my face that don’t fade quickly.\nI’m not sure if this is clogged pores, irritation, or something else, so I’d really appreciate any advice. Are there products or routines that help with sebum plugs, blackheads, and overall texture?\nI’ve attached photos of my chest/ large area of my back , cheek area, jawline, and forehead.\nThanks to anyone who can help!",

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",
