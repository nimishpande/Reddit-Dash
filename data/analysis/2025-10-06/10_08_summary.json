I didnt know washing my hair every day was bad, or that i should be wearing a bonnet to bed. She has helped me some but im wondering now if im leaving my coconut oil in to long.\n\nRoutine\nOkay so now before I go to bed I put jojoba oil on my scalp and massage it in. Then I put coconut oil in my hair and I put my hair up in a bonnet then go to sleep.\n\nI do this every night and now wash then wait 2 days before washing again. So the oil is building up every day. Is this bad? Should I not do this as often?\n\nMy fear is if I dont do it though my hair will not look good in the morning or I will have to wash it out, and im trying to avoid washing my hair everyday. \n\n",

I try to wash it once or twice a week so I can reduce the amount of heat I put on it. It’s still extremely damaged however &amp; I’m very insecure about it. I just hate that even when I straighten it, you can still tell I have curly hair because of the way it looks. I also can never seem to figure out how to part my hair &amp; I never like it. I started getting highlights when I was 14 &amp; would get them twiceish a year. I did this until last November — at which time I switched to just bleaching the whole head. I know I know, the bleach is not helping the damage. Basically my question is — I’m getting my hair done tomorrow, &amp; I’m wondering what I should get done. Pics 1-6 are with the bleach. 7-9 I was only getting highlights. And the last pic is my hair right now with my roots grown out. What color do you guys think would suit me best? Should I keep bleaching? Go back to my natural color? I need a hairstylist’s advice — what exactly should I ask for in your opinion that best flatters my facial features. I also would love advice on hair care, styling, etc. I currently use a hair dryer brush to “blowout” my hair while it’s 30% wet and then either wear it like that or then use a curling iron on it after.

However when I put my head upside down it looks really nice! \n\nI had curly hair when I was a child but when growing up, I used to bleach my hair and cut them really short so there was absolutely no curl pattern. \nI’m in the process of growing my hair long and they always looked curly-ish while wet so I wanted to try this new routine.\n\nWhat do you think? \nShould I keep doing this routine or my hair pattern isn’t worth it? \nAlso why does it look fabulous upside down but terrible in a normal position?

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "EDIT: *I would like to kindly point out that I am not looking for mental health suggestions or comments about my potential internet habits, just the topic at hand which is how is peach fuzz perceived by the general public, thank you, I really appreciate it!*\n\n\n*Please state which continent/country you are from as I believe there is some cultural clash from how we talk about beauty in different parts of the world, as I see that it is discouraged to talk about how to dress/do makeup for others in the USA*\n\n\n\n**TEXT**\n\n\n\nIs peach fuzz really considered that unattractive and important to remove?\n\nEver since I began following beauty related subs it seems like everyone is shaving their face. Which makes me question is it that noticeable? Do people think less of you if you don't shave your face? How long and which colour are the hairs you have while unshaved?\n\n\nI have lanugo left from when I was in the hospital almost dying from some medical issues that also cause a rapid and severe weight loss, and now I am questioning why exactly are people different towards me than before.\n\n\nI understand my eye got a bit different because of the bells palsy and my eyes are not simetrical and I was fine with that as I can't really do anything about it and do not want to get surgery at this time; but lanugo I can definitely shave or pluck of but it is still quite a hastle because my skin is really thin from years of strong medications that reduce collagen production.\n\n\nSo my question really is, did you notice a difference in how people perceive you when you started removing your peach fuzz/lanugo? I am not asking about romantic encounters, more about professional encounters or encounters with acquaintances and other people that you don't have intention to get romantically or sexually involved with. I would also like to hear what is your make-up day to day (not eyes, more so if you use concealer/foundation/CC/BB...).\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "I have been celibate for 4.5 years, and am finally being intimate with someone I care about. Except the first time we did it, I was ashamed of my full bush. So I decided to have my first Brazilian wax at a highly rated place. I did it on 9/24… and am still having issues. The lady seemed to know what she was doing, was comforting, etc. so I believe it might be my skin, not her. \n\nI have a DARK Venus mound… I will admit I did not wash up as soon as I got home from the appt. I let it be, gently patted it with hypoallergenic wipes (I was exhausted) and showered in the morning. I don’t think this would be a huge deal, but I ultimately woke up with a few ingrowns. No big deal, those go away.\n\nThen I developed SEVERAL tiny white bumps ALL over… and noticed my skin are significantly darker. I have been cleaning it with unscented soap, applying hypochlorous acid spray, using alcohol-free witch hazel a couple times a week (it’s been 1.5 weeks), applying aloe Vera gel, and wearing loose clothing. Nothing is helping. And I’m afraid to try anything else. \n\nI already suffer from acne, some KP, and milia on my chest. I have sensitive skin but I didn’t think this was even a risk..\n\nThe lady told me after 2 days, sex should be fine. So, I had sex and unexpectedly slept over. I brought my hypochlorous acid spray to mitigate the heat in his apartment.\n\nI went home to it worse than the day before. Then it got better. And I’ve been babying it ever since. And I feel like it just wont get better anymore. I’m ashamed and told him I don’t want to have sex anymore until this heals.. I’m worried this will drive him away or make him distant. \n\nI’m devastated because it’s been so long for me. And now I want to hide again, for this reason alone. I never had this issue before with shaving or anything. Please help. I’m at a loss. ",

      "title": "Sticky lint creating massive knots/tangles. Best way to remove/prevent?",
      "content": "Hi all! I'm a newbie to the curly girl method so I'm currently mid-transition, and having a few hurdles to jump. But my biggest issue right now is when it comes to detangling my hair.\n\nI've done my best to follow the method described in the CG guide; thoroughly wet hair, apply plenty of conditioner until it feels like seaweed, then use a wide-tooth comb and my fingers to detangle.  \nThe actual tangles come away super easily, just a little fiddling with my fingers at most, but then I come across the knots.  \nAt first, I thought these were just really bad tangles or actual knots in my hair, but I quickly discovered that every single one of these \"knots\" are actually small, black, sticky balls of lint or fuzz that are *strongly* sticking my hair together. I've only been on the CG method for a short while now, so I've only detangled my hair with this method a handful of times, but every time it's taken me around *two hours* purely because of these little sticky balls. Last time I detangled, I spent almost an hour on one particularly large and stubborn ball because I really didn't want to have to resort to breaking my hair just to get it out (even though that kinda happened anyway because it was so stuck).\n\nI've tried to research what the cause is. Some say its inevitable fuzz from clothing, some say it's caused by product build-up (which is rough because without leave-in products my hair is even more of a frizzy mess that it already is), and some say it's something that's more severe when you have dry hair (I do). So I'm really not sure. I just want to know how to stop it because it drives me nuts!!\n\nMy routine as it as now, if it helps:\n\n1. Detangle with [Goat Conditioner](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/77579/goat-conditioner-original-300ml) (I swap between the Original and Coconut Oil one)\n2. Co-wash with same conditioner\n3. Rinse out, leaving in a small amount of the conditioner (as per CG method)\n4. Scrunch/gently squeeze out excess fluid with cotton t-shirt (so it's not dripping too much, but still wet)\n5. Spray in some [Kristin Ess Curl Leave-in Creme](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/122666/kristin-ess-curl-leave-in-creme-250ml) (I usually spray a little more in as it dries, since frizz starts to appear)\n6. Use a satin bonnet to sleep in, at least for the first few nights after\n\nI do this once or twice a week. If it helps, the \"knots\" seem to be more concentrated in the hair at the back of my neck, a good few inches from my scalp. I suspected it was my pillowcases or something, but from what I can tell sleeping with the bonnet hasn't made much of a difference (but then again it hasn't been that long so it's hard to say).\n\n  \nIf I could get some advice on how to better treat/avoid this issue that would be awesome. Thanks so much!",
