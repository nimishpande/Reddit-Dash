However when I put my head upside down it looks really nice! \n\nI had curly hair when I was a child but when growing up, I used to bleach my hair and cut them really short so there was absolutely no curl pattern. \nI’m in the process of growing my hair long and they always looked curly-ish while wet so I wanted to try this new routine.\n\nWhat do you think? \nShould I keep doing this routine or my hair pattern isn’t worth it? \nAlso why does it look fabulous upside down but terrible in a normal position? Should I get a better haircut with layers? Idk \n\nThanks for your advices!\n",

So I decided to have my first Brazilian wax at a highly rated place. I did it on 9/24… and am still having issues. The lady seemed to know what she was doing, was comforting, etc. so I believe it might be my skin, not her. \n\nI have a DARK Venus mound… I will admit I did not wash up as soon as I got home from the appt. I let it be, gently patted it with hypoallergenic wipes (I was exhausted) and showered in the morning. I don’t think this would be a huge deal, but I ultimately woke up with a few ingrowns. No big deal, those go away.\n\nThen I developed SEVERAL tiny white bumps ALL over… and noticed my skin are significantly darker. I have been cleaning it with unscented soap, applying hypochlorous acid spray, using alcohol-free witch hazel a couple times a week (it’s been 1.5 weeks), applying aloe Vera gel, and wearing loose clothing. Nothing is helping. And I’m afraid to try anything else. \n\nI already suffer from acne, some KP, and milia on my chest. I have sensitive skin but I didn’t think this was even a risk..\n\nThe lady told me after 2 days, sex should be fine. So, I had sex and unexpectedly slept over. I brought my hypochlorous acid spray to mitigate the heat in his apartment.\n\nI went home to it worse than the day before. Then it got better. And I’ve been babying it ever since. And I feel like it just wont get better anymore. I’m ashamed and told him I don’t want to have sex anymore until this heals.. I’m worried this will drive him away or make him distant. \n\nI’m devastated because it’s been so long for me. And now I want to hide again, for this reason alone. I never had this issue before with shaving or anything. Please help. I’m at a loss. ",

      "content": "Recently my skin has been breaking out worse than ever and has migrated to my chest which it hasn’t done before and i don’t know why. i worked as a lifeguard this summer where i was in and out of the pool and putting sunscreen on my face like crazy, but ever since i moved back to school this fall my skin has been HORRIBLE. I currently use cerave facial cleanser, dermatologica daily milkfoliant, hylauronic acid, and cerave night moisturizer. The dermatologica one is the only thing i spend a lot on because it gets rid of the texture on my nose and seems to make it less dry, and I also like the hylauronic acid because it makes my skin look dewy and glowy. Now for context: I am almost 21 now and feel like I should be past the awkward hormonal acne phase, but i’m still not. i have used EVERYTHING and seen a dermatologist many times with no change. ready for the list? here it goes: glycolic acid, salicylic acid, tretinoin, clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide gel, differin gel, azelaic acid and i have also tried various products including dove soap, cerave, laroche posay, cetaphil, aveeno, the ordinary, and probably so many more i’m forgetting. most of the things the dermatologist prescribed made my skin incredibly dry and didn’t make that much of a difference and i’ve spent so much money on them i refuse to go back becuz nothing they give me ever works. im so sick of trying everything and it not working. i had that phase in like 2019-2020 where we all bought a million products because of skin care by hyram or whatever his name was, but i still had acne. i then saw posts about how too many things can cause breakouts so i reduced the amount of things I was using. I even stopped all my skincare all together to try to get my skin back to normal, but i honestly gave up a while ago and have just been sticking with my basic routine for a while even tho i know it doesn’t work because i am so sick of trying. i don’t want to go on accutane because I am already on antidepressants and drink on the weekends as a college student and don’t want my lips to be nasty, etc etc etc. this reddit post is legit my last attempt at trying to figure my skin out after like 8 years, so any advice helps really, i just don’t wanna go out buying $200 on a bunch of shit that probably won’t work anyways (i’m a broke college student and have too much going on to focus on this stuff). If you’re interested and want more details about my skin and how it has reacted to different products, i can let you know. i honestly don’t expect anyone to reply to this so don’t feel like u have to, im just curious if anyone has any ideas or anything. thanks &lt;3",

      "content": "Hi all! I'm a newbie to the curly girl method so I'm currently mid-transition, and having a few hurdles to jump. But my biggest issue right now is when it comes to detangling my hair.\n\nI've done my best to follow the method described in the CG guide; thoroughly wet hair, apply plenty of conditioner until it feels like seaweed, then use a wide-tooth comb and my fingers to detangle.  \nThe actual tangles come away super easily, just a little fiddling with my fingers at most, but then I come across the knots.  \nAt first, I thought these were just really bad tangles or actual knots in my hair, but I quickly discovered that every single one of these \"knots\" are actually small, black, sticky balls of lint or fuzz that are *strongly* sticking my hair together. I've only been on the CG method for a short while now, so I've only detangled my hair with this method a handful of times, but every time it's taken me around *two hours* purely because of these little sticky balls. Last time I detangled, I spent almost an hour on one particularly large and stubborn ball because I really didn't want to have to resort to breaking my hair just to get it out (even though that kinda happened anyway because it was so stuck).\n\nI've tried to research what the cause is. Some say its inevitable fuzz from clothing, some say it's caused by product build-up (which is rough because without leave-in products my hair is even more of a frizzy mess that it already is), and some say it's something that's more severe when you have dry hair (I do). So I'm really not sure. I just want to know how to stop it because it drives me nuts!!\n\nMy routine as it as now, if it helps:\n\n1. Detangle with [Goat Conditioner](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/77579/goat-conditioner-original-300ml) (I swap between the Original and Coconut Oil one)\n2. Co-wash with same conditioner\n3. Rinse out, leaving in a small amount of the conditioner (as per CG method)\n4. Scrunch/gently squeeze out excess fluid with cotton t-shirt (so it's not dripping too much, but still wet)\n5. Spray in some [Kristin Ess Curl Leave-in Creme](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/122666/kristin-ess-curl-leave-in-creme-250ml) (I usually spray a little more in as it dries, since frizz starts to appear)\n6. Use a satin bonnet to sleep in, at least for the first few nights after\n\nI do this once or twice a week. If it helps, the \"knots\" seem to be more concentrated in the hair at the back of my neck, a good few inches from my scalp. I suspected it was my pillowcases or something, but from what I can tell sleeping with the bonnet hasn't made much of a difference (but then again it hasn't been that long so it's hard to say).\n\n  \nIf I could get some advice on how to better treat/avoid this issue that would be awesome. Thanks so much!",

It has helped with active acne, and I basically don't have anymore!\n\nNow I would like to begin targeting my acne scarring, especially my nose.\n\nMy nose has holes from acne scarring, also my cheeks too. It's like mini holes on my cheek but my nose has some bigger dents.\n\nCan tretinoin + azelaic acid help in this? Or do I need to get skincare treatment?\n\nI am prepared to spend to clear this up.\n\nAny assistance appreciated",
