Whenever I have free time , the first thing I’m not thinking is to feel attractive(which I wish it was) I just watch TV and fall asleep.

However when I put my head upside down it looks really nice! \n\nI had curly hair when I was a child but when growing up, I used to bleach my hair and cut them really short so there was absolutely no curl pattern. \nI’m in the process of growing my hair long and they always looked curly-ish while wet so I wanted to try this new routine.\n\nWhat do you think? \nShould I keep doing this routine or my hair pattern isn’t worth it? \nAlso why does it look fabulous upside down but terrible in a normal position? Should I get a better haircut with layers? Idk \n\nThanks for your advices!\n",

But that’s $$$. And stylist’s will always do your hair in a way that can’t seem to be achieved at home). Now I style my hair usually ends up curlier than the pic. \n\nCan anyone recommend their fave curl cream (and lightweight conditioner for future buy if possible)? \n\nRoutine: shampoo- Odele sensitive or clarifying shampoo, 4u lightweight conditioner (*this is made for much curlier hair, I just grabbed it because it said lightweight but didn’t realize the brand is mostly for type 3-4hair.

      "content": "Hi everyone, please help me manage expectations.\n\nSo I have had red hair for about 5 years now. The appointment before last, I lightened it with highlights and had a light red (see last photo), and I came in with a faded version of this with roots for this recent session.\n\nI wanted to go back to blonde. I’m naturally blonde, although probably now more light brown considering my hair has probably changed and hasn’t seen the light of day in years.\n\nShe did a heavy highlight throughout all my hair and then for the pieces she’s didn’t highlight, she went in with a toner to neutralize the red as much as she could.\n\nI understand red is like the hardest to get out of hair, and honestly she did a really good job getting me pretty blonde in a single session… but god I hate it so much. The first couple photos of the roots (pics 1 &amp; 2), I told her I really needed it blended and I couldn’t live like that. After her trying to tell me it will fade a bit over time, she let me come in the next day to do some foils up top to blend in those lines…\n\nSo I think it looks a lot better afterwards (pics 3-5), but I still really really hate it. It’s so yellow and brassy and not what I wanted. I’m lucky that I didn’t really lose any of my hair during the process and now it’s time to let it heal…\n\nBUT how long do I have to live with this hair? I have kinda been at rock bottom in my life and my outward appearance is the only thing I feel like I can control. It’s really affecting my mental state and I just need to know what I can expect out of my next session and what to ask for. Sorry if this seems dramatic, I don’t want to knock the stylist at all, I just want to know my options.",

Will obviously discuss with my fertility doctor in 2 days. \n\n————————\n\n\nWe’ve had a long journey TTC for few years and then went down the route of IVF to finally be pregnant. I’m currently about 5 weeks along.\n\nI just realized my husband has been using topical finasteride/minoxidil (HIMS) on his hair a few times a week. Knowing how dangerous finasteride is to fetal development, I’m now freaking out trying to remember if I’ve ever touched his hair directly after or touched something indirectly after he’s touched it? He says he sprayed it in mornings before heading to work and washes hands after (and we then don’t see each other until the end of the day) so that part makes me feel A LITTLE better but I can’t help but spiral, especially since this is a very hard road to get to this pregnancy. Anyone been in my shoes and everything turn out ok? He said he will stop using it from now on but I’m worried about anything from beforehand :( thanks in advance",

I've JUST started applying Glycolic acid on my face every other night. This is followed by Cetaphil moisturizing cream.\n\nI would love to achieve even skin tone and no dark bumps.

For reference, she is 58 turning 59 this year, south asian, and the past few years especially has been so insecure about the way she looks, to the point where she doesn’t even take or look at any pictures of herself. Recently he biggest concern has been here eyes - dark circles, sunken eyes (and to be honest these are legitimate in some way). She bought a bunch of cheap eye patches and creams off amazon as she doesn’t like spending a lot of money and she loved how having a routine made her feel like she was doing something - although ultimately they had little impact. I would love to get her some quality care items but don’t know where to begin. She is allergic to fragrances and has more sensitive skin. If anyone has any advice thoughts or recommendations please let me know! No real budget but nothing over $50 for one product. Thanks!",
