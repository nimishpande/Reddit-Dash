      "content": "I haven't cut my curly hair in 4 years - partly because I never felt great after a haircut, and because I met a hairstylist who I really wanted to cut my hair but never found the time to travel to her.\n\nThe past few months I have really been loving my hair, like I'd never loved me hair this much. Because it was so long, when I added volumed didn't look strange. It felt so \"me\" and really suited my style. \n\nI found a different hairdresser through instagram and DMed her for what I thought would just be a consultation (maybe I'm dumb here), but I was nervous for even that. When I got in the chair I thought, what's the worst that can happen, she can trim my ends and I'll go to that other stylist for a style next year . I told her during our very brief consultation (don't think it was even 5 minutes) that I really love my hair and wanted to keep/grow it long (she even said \"everyone wants long hair\"... I had long hair??). She ended up cutting about 6 inches (I'm guessing) of my hair off, way more than she showed me. And it is the shortest I have ever seen it. I still have split ends btw (I don't think I ever won't, don't know how my hair ever grows but it does lol)\n\nI was genuinely in shock when I saw and have been crying every day since. I'm finding it hard to think about that I have to wait another 4 years to love my hair, by that time I'll be 30, and I guess these are supposed to be some important years of my life. I am so devastated as have been going through a hard time this year already and this has really sent me. I am telling myself it will all come back within 6 months, which I doubt. I really hate how I look now. \n\nWill it actually \"grow back quicker\" 😩 what can I do??",

I didnt know washing my hair every day was bad, or that i should be wearing a bonnet to bed. She has helped me some but im wondering now if im leaving my coconut oil in to long.\n\nRoutine\nOkay so now before I go to bed I put jojoba oil on my scalp and massage it in. Then I put coconut oil in my hair and I put my hair up in a bonnet then go to sleep.\n\nI do this every night and now wash then wait 2 days before washing again. So the oil is building up every day. Is this bad? Should I not do this as often?\n\nMy fear is if I dont do it though my hair will not look good in the morning or I will have to wash it out, and im trying to avoid washing my hair everyday. \n\n",

      "content": "Just to get it out of the way, **yes I'm aware the photos have slightly different lighting and hair length**! I have a haircut next week at least so I'll chuck another photo up then, but hopefully the progress is still clear here.\n\nI'm a 43 male, I first noticed thinning on my crown right in the vertex about 12 years ago. The thinning progressed over all those years to what you see in the July 3rd photo here when I started treatment. I'm delighted with how it's gone so far, the new growth, density and thickness has been much more than I had expected being of my age. So I hope this post gives some optimism to other middle-agers looking into starting treatment.\n\nI went for a pretty light treatment protocol with the intention to evaluate after 3 months:\n\n* Topical Minoxidil (5%) + Finasteride (0.025%) in TrichoSol (product is called FINASOL-M from Hair Repair Clinic in the UK) - 1ml every day (apart from dermastamp days). I use a cheap roll-on applicator from Amazon, and only target the affected area of my scalp.\n* 0.75mm microneedling (dermastamp) once every 2 weeks. I started with 1mm but that drew a small amount of blood, so moved to 0.75mm which has been perfect. No topical application on stamping days.\n\n**Sides**: I have had absolutely no perceivable sides whatsoever. I imagine this is due to a) using topical and b) a low strength Fin at 0.025%. I am also fairly fit, regular exercise and have a pretty healthy diet, including a basic supplement stack (normal dosages) for a man of my vintage - magnesium, zinc, vitamin B complex inc biotin, vitamin D3 + k2, lecithin). I don't know if any of those helped negate sides but I thought I'd put them in here, if anything just to remind older guys that that supplementing is important as we age.\n\n**Next steps**: I have another 3 months supply of the same formula, I don't see any reason to change what I'm doing. After those 3 months, if progress is just as good, I might even look at reducing Fin down to 0.0125% - studies have shown that to be very effective still with 0% reduction in serum DHT. I'll see where we I am in the New Year!",

The right side of my chin is somewhat dry yet, but mostly got CCs which I resolved with painstaking care. The left side of my chin got no CCs, but it’s rough to the touch. Not peeling much, and visually it really does look fairly normal (you can’t really tell it’s dry with a glance), but it’s just rough feeling and not as healthy as it should be. It’s been an issue since, like, July. I didn’t think much of it at first and just applied my normal moisturizer twice daily, but I’ve stepped it up this past week out of concern. I assumed it would resolve quickly—nope.\n\nI use a Korean moisturizer loaded with centella asiatica extract twice per day. I’ve also been using a 30% Panthenol serum, and tried layering Vaseline on the last four days. Improvement is…debatable. But I feel like I’m already using the most recommended ingredients for barrier issues.\n\nIs healing just going to be a very slow process no matter what? I’m so mad at the AA.

However when I put my head upside down it looks really nice! \n\nI had curly hair when I was a child but when growing up, I used to bleach my hair and cut them really short so there was absolutely no curl pattern. \nI’m in the process of growing my hair long and they always looked curly-ish while wet so I wanted to try this new routine.\n\nWhat do you think? \nShould I keep doing this routine or my hair pattern isn’t worth it? \nAlso why does it look fabulous upside down but terrible in a normal position? Should I get a better haircut with layers? Idk \n\nThanks for your advices!\n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

On the internet, combination skin is mostly defined as \"oily on the T zone, dry on the cheeks\" but thats not whats happening with me. My skin feels super dry and its even flaking and peeling on my T zone, but at the same time its super oily on the same T zone, while my cheeks feels normal. The skin on my forehead and especially my nose is always peeling and flaking, and always feels tight from dryness; but theres also extra oil on the same area, they re always super shiny and oily. If i use moisturizer for dry skin to help with my peeling on the T zone, the oil on my T zone gets even worse. If i use moisturizer for oily/combination skin, this time the peeling and flaking gets worse. I have no idea what to do at this point, ive been searching for a moisturizer that works with my mess of a skin type for YEARS. Both dryness and oil is happening at the same time on my T zone simultaneously. i dont know what to do. ls there other people experiencing the same thing as I? cannot find anything about this online either. I also would appreciate any moisturizer recommendations for my skin.",
