Obviously causes a lot of drag. On days I want to feel sexy, I tend to use a Westman athelier foundation stick for my legs. Love the look but it’s super costly too. I’m here seeking some help in terms of what to do to make the scars disappear. \n\nI have stopped dating as I feel ugly and men would t want me. I stopped wearing dresses etc. All these scarring happened in the last two years when I moved into a house and there was a flea infestation but no longer. The older scars are healing though but it’s super slow. \n\nSo I have changed my diet. I drink chicken Boone broth four times a week which a high protein diet, work out 6 days a week. Whenever I shower immediately after it, I will apply cera ve moisturising cream. Whenever I head out I will apply sunscreen and at night, I will apply 20% vitamin c serum and after waiting for a while, silicone gel. Is there anything else I should do? \n\nI’ll attach some pics for you to see. There are pics with and without the foundation on my legs. Huge difference and big confidence booster but it can be expensive. My left arm is fully scarred too as shown in the pics. \n\nIf anyone has any tips, pls let me know. I have a race this June and I wouldn’t have to be covering up. I hope these scars disappear by then ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "I’ve always struggled with acne on my face. Recently I started using a 5% Benzoyl Peroxide cream after seeing everyone say it was great. I tested it on my back and it seemed fine, no burning sensations or issues at all, but after using it on my face for a few weeks, it feels like it’s made my skin even worse. I’m not sure if this is just a coincidence, but it truly feels like it.\n\n Before, my spots were always primarily on my chin and forehead, but after using the cream I’ve been getting spots in places on my face where I’ve never had them before. I’ve decided to stop using the cream, but my skin is still struggling. My chin is suffering the most, as I’ve been getting large, red spots that are painful to touch and the skin around it is dry. I always try my best not to squeeze or touch my spots, I moisturize my skin, frequently change my bedding and my diet is quite normal. I wash my face twice a day with cerave’s blemish control cleaner but nothing seems to be helping. I’m quite desperate for advice. I’m considering birth control, as I know that could help, but I’m open to other suggestions first too.",

      "content": "Actually, I often see people struggling with skincare and asking for help, so I thought why not share what worked for me based on my own experience and experiments? It might help someone.\n\nI attached a picture for reference as the final result, which is as accurate as possible. \n\nA few months ago, I started taking my health seriously. I began going to the gym and improved my diet. Skincare wasn’t even on my list, but as I focused on nutrition and fitness, my skin started improving automatically. Later, I wondered how much more I could improve it if I paid attention.\nPhysical activity helped a lot. I go to the gym, but you can do anything  running, sports, or any exercise that makes you sweat and pushes you a little. It contributes more to your skin than people think.\nI don’t go outside much, but for those who do, use sunscreen. Sun damage is real  I’ve seen it on my own skin. Prevention is always easier than fixing it later.\nI had blackheads near my nose and occasional pimples. During my research, I learned that excess oil can cause many skin problems. At that time, I was drinking over 500 ml of milk daily, so I reduced my fat intake. My thinking was simple  if I consume less excess fat, my body may produce less oil. It actually worked. Now I take about 300 ml of milk (mostly in tea) and roughly 35–40 grams of fat in total. Don’t reduce fat completely ,it’s essential just avoid excess.\nI also noticed that whenever I ate outside food frequently, I got pimples. So now I mostly eat clean home food and keep outside meals limited. Balance is important  you don’t have to eliminate it completely.\nI sleep around 7–8 hours, follow a high-protein diet with normal meals, and since I don’t eat many leafy vegetables or salads, I take a multivitamin to cover any gaps.\nMy theory was that the body can heal itself if you provide the right things and in my case, that turned out to be true.\nSo instead of spending too much money on skincare products to fix problems, try fixing the root cause first. Reduce excess fat, stay physically active, eat mostly clean food, sleep properly, and use sunscreen\n\n\n",

I've seen some people mention that I should use a more easily absorbed hand cream but I've tried a few (well, three or so) and all of them make my hands greasy. Is it really a problem of the hand cream or am I doing something wrong? (Am I just an idiot and putting too much?)\n\nI've also seen some people on this subreddit mention that they only apply it to the back of their hands. That's not an option for me considering my palms are the ones that get really dry.\n\nThe second (more major) problem: my hands follow a cycle that goes somewhat like this:\n\n1. Sweat. A lot.\n2. Dry and promptly start peeling.\n3. Rinse and repeat.\n\nIt's almost like they swing from extreme to extreme without stopping in between. This cycle doesn't have a period either, so I have no way of predicting when they'll be dry and when they'll be wet. Sometimes I can go for a month without dry skin, sometimes barely a week. If I apply hand cream when my hands are dry (and peeling) they'll start sweating like crazy. And if I apply it while they're wet...well I've never tried because it frankly seems like a rather ridiculous idea. \n\nI've read that I should use hand cream regularly, but how do I do that when my hands are soaking wet 50% of the time?",
