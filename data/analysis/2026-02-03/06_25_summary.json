      "content": "Why is my hair straight at the roots and ends? Why is it only curly in the middle?\n\nFull disclosure, I used ChatGPT to blur the background and remove the local logo from my shirt.\n\nMy hair has gotten curlier as I’ve gotten older.  I noticed recently that the ends of my hair are not so curly or wavy. The roots of my hair have always been straighter as shown in the photo. Why is only the middle section curly??\n\nMy normal routine: I wash and condition my hair every other day usually. I rotate products. Today I used Elvive Dream Lengths Split End Sealing shampoo and conditioner. Other days I use OGX tea tree clarifying shampoo and conditioner. I also have a bottle of Mane ‘n Tail Herbal Gro shampoo that I randomly use sometimes. \n\nToday I washed and conditioned my hair this morning with the Elvive Dream Lengths, combed it, and let it air dry. This is my normal routine. I’ve been trying to grow my hair out to a longer length. I haven’t had a haircut in 6 months. \n\nSometimes, I scrunch my Prose curl cream in my hair or put OGX coconut milk hair oil on the ends.\n\nSometimes, about once a week, I blow dry my hair with my Shark blow dryer and use the round brush attachment to straighten it. I recently got the Tymo Curlpro Plus curling tool that I’ve used a few times. Other than those tools, I let my hair be. I’ve never colored my hair.\n\nWhy are the ends not curly?? Is it time for a chop?",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Above is my skin getting a weird bumpiness to it and also looking red and irritated. I feel like it’s definitely not liking what I’m doing to it, but I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong 🥹\n\nFor the first 20ish years of my life I basically did no skincare at all. I washed my face in the shower with a body wash meant for babies and almost never lotioned because I despise the texture, but if I did it would be with Aveeno body lotion. On occasion in high school I would search around for a dedicated facial cleanser/moisturizer to use but even the most gentle sensitive skin marketed ones turn my entire face bright red and burning and leave me itching, it’s so annoying lmao\n\nFor instance I got LRP toleraine and it burned the shit outta me, same with Clinique 3 step\n\nBeen trying Cetaphil skin barrier intensive healing lotion and it also burns me somewhat, but also just kind of sits on my skin looking greasy and sweaty and prevents me from going to bed without wiping it off because it’s so uncomfortable to put my face near my pillow like that \n\nI got into this now because I want to do Tretinoin, I have noticed some fine line wrinkles starting to form on my forehead at an age where they really shouldn’t lol, probably because I spent 20 years not moisturizing almost ever \n\nAnyway. WTF DO I DO IF MY SKIN SEEMS TO REJECT LITERALLY EVERYTHING? Is there anything that couldn’t possibly irritate me. If I don’t feel like bothering with the redness I do a the ordinary aloe serum, the ordinary squalane, and my aveeno lotion, and call it a day \n\nYou don’t need to recommend an SPF I’m struggling enough as it is and I also don’t really leave the house lmao. The sun is not seeing me \n\nI think niacinamide burns me but I’m not positive. I tried hyaluronic acid (the ordinary) and made sure my face was wet but it still felt off, not bright red but weird and tacky and dry itchy\n\nI just want nice skin but I swear I looked better when I was dry as shit unmoisturized not in my lane not thriving LMAO\n\nLiterally any advice is appreciated. I have been using the aveeno more and if it’s okay I’ll just keep using it but it’s a body lotion so I’m not sure if people think it works for face moisture. And even when I use the gentlest of the gentle face cleansers for dry skin I feel like they still leave my skin feeling tight and a little itchy and I just want to give up and go back to the body wash for babies lol",

I wash it every day (I refuse not to lol), don’t blow dry it only air dry, never use any other heat either, and it can get greasy at the roots by the end of the day. Please help!!!

My lips suddenly started feeling swollen/weird, and as it progressed there’s these hard to see little swollen bumps.\n\nThey do not hurt but are slightly sensitive and are not blisters and do not leak, they almost feel like an allergic reaction/burn of sorts. I have not changed anything in my routine, and especially not my lip routine which is basically just Vaseline lip care in the little tubs. The only thing that has changed is I also have a tub of it that has vitamin e in it that I use occasionally in my bag.\n\nI have NEVER had a cold sore prior to this, and while I’m not saying it’s not possible but without getting TMI it would’ve had to be a coincidence as I make a conscious effort to not drink/eat/kiss people I do not know.\n\nI’ve seen posts in the past saying that the lip care from Vaseline is what cause it, but the OP’s said it took 2 weeks to go away which with all due respect is the exact same recovery time for a cold sore.\n\nIf you guys have experienced this or recognize it from the photos please let me know! I really do religiously use the Vaseline lip care but I have for a long time and have never experienced anything like this.",

With valentine's day coming up and my girlfriend's new hobby of doing her own and our daughters nails, Im looking to get something related to make her happy this year.\n\nShe recently bought things like the UV lamp, tons of polishes, different nails with different styles, etc.\n\nOne thing she mentions is some kind of \"cat eye\" polish? It looks like Metallic paint to me but she swears thats what its called :P you use a magnet to get a cool effect.\n\nI was hoping to find some lighter colour's, as most of the ones she has and can find are pretty dark, but I naturally have no clue where to look or even what brands are worth buying, and where is worth buying from.\n\nAny recommendations would be great, and help me a ton! Money isnt exactly \"no object\" but i dont want to get her cheap stuff that isnt good either, if that helps.\n\nTIA! :)",

      "title": "Damaged looking hair in the winter!! Tried everything and desperate",
      "content": "I noticed that in the winter, my hair tends to look super weighed down, dull, frizzy, and stretched out. (Last photo is a bit old, but it is what my hair looks like at it’s best even with the added dye) I also move back and forth from somewhere with slightly more humidity and where it’s not as cold to somewhere where there is almost zero humidity and temperatures are freezing (my college). I also suspect that the water at my college (dorm) is hard water and is damaging my hair. I think, but can’t tell if one or both of those things are what’s affecting my hair since I do notice my hair getting worse at college. \nThis is my current routine (once- twice weekly) and products:\n1. Curlsmith reset detox shampoo (clarifying, every few washes), or regular Curlsmith shampoo every wash\n2. Not your mother’s curl talk bond building conditioner (rinse). \n3. Curlsmith weightless airdry cream, rake through + scrunch\n4. Curlsmith in shower style fixer strong hold gel (I use this generously), rake through + scrunch \n5. Bounce curl defining brush, scrunch. \n6. Diffuse until dry (hover dry until I feel a slight cast, then cup my hair with the diffuser, warm temp high speed)\n7. break gel cast with fructis oil\n8. I use the Curlsmith bond rehab salve mask once a month. (After shampoo and before conditioner)\nThe first two pictures were taken hours after I washed and styled my hair, and a week after I got a haircut with layers since at first I thought my length was weighing my hair down. As you can see, I tried to finger curl it later on to save it, but it didn’t work. Here are some other details that might be helpful:\n- I do not straighten my hair, and I don’t have any heat damage that I know of (last time I did was a year and a half ago)\n- I wear a bonnet when lounging around but not to sleep since I noticed it deforms my curls when on overnight. I just put my hair above my head to avoid sleeping on top of it.\n- I believe my hair is high to medium porosity\n- I get my hair professionally colored twice a year at a curl specialist (once fully and once for my roots) \n- I do not use a brush in the shower to detangle my hair as I’m worried about breakage. I finger comb.\nThis post is super long but I would appreciate any help!! I feel like I have tried everything and just find myself frustrated most days because of how much time and money I spend on my curls, but find that especially in the winter, it doesn’t last more than two days before I need to put it up because it’s flat, lacks definition, and frizzy. Is it the friction from wearing a winter coat? Is it the lack of humidity or the cold itself? Hard water? (Which I can’t fix given I’m in a dorm) Is there anything I can change about my routine/ products? I can’t tell if I need to add moisture, use less, more protein, less protein, I’m lost!\n",
