Obviously causes a lot of drag. On days I want to feel sexy, I tend to use a Westman athelier foundation stick for my legs. Love the look but it’s super costly too. I’m here seeking some help in terms of what to do to make the scars disappear. \n\nI have stopped dating as I feel ugly and men would t want me. I stopped wearing dresses etc. All these scarring happened in the last two years when I moved into a house and there was a flea infestation but no longer. The older scars are healing though but it’s super slow. \n\nSo I have changed my diet. I drink chicken Boone broth four times a week which a high protein diet, work out 6 days a week. Whenever I shower immediately after it, I will apply cera ve moisturising cream. Whenever I head out I will apply sunscreen and at night, I will apply 20% vitamin c serum and after waiting for a while, silicone gel. Is there anything else I should do? \n\nI’ll attach some pics for you to see. There are pics with and without the foundation on my legs. Huge difference and big confidence booster but it can be expensive. My left arm is fully scarred too as shown in the pics. \n\nIf anyone has any tips, pls let me know. I have a race this June and I wouldn’t have to be covering up. I hope these scars disappear by then ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "I’ve always struggled with acne on my face. Recently I started using a 5% Benzoyl Peroxide cream after seeing everyone say it was great. I tested it on my back and it seemed fine, no burning sensations or issues at all, but after using it on my face for a few weeks, it feels like it’s made my skin even worse. I’m not sure if this is just a coincidence, but it truly feels like it.\n\n Before, my spots were always primarily on my chin and forehead, but after using the cream I’ve been getting spots in places on my face where I’ve never had them before. I’ve decided to stop using the cream, but my skin is still struggling. My chin is suffering the most, as I’ve been getting large, red spots that are painful to touch and the skin around it is dry. I always try my best not to squeeze or touch my spots, I moisturize my skin, frequently change my bedding and my diet is quite normal. I wash my face twice a day with cerave’s blemish control cleaner but nothing seems to be helping. I’m quite desperate for advice. I’m considering birth control, as I know that could help, but I’m open to other suggestions first too.",

I haven't changed anything in my routine tho\n\nI did have a massive lost of weight due to a burn out, to the point where I was 10kg below what should be my limit, to the point where I've stopped growing.

I own a Dyson and that used to work great but one section down and my hair was BRITTLE (which I guess is par for the course with bleached hair but I guess as a baby blonde I panicked a bit). I rough dried a bit and then just put it in a silk bonnet and I’m heading for bed\n\nI’m terrible at doing a blowout but I’ve heard that’s the best method to get your hair looking nice. What would you guys recommend? Also does anyone have any good recs to get a nice lift at the root? My hair has always been pretty flat on top haha\n\nFor products I always use a leave in conditioner on the ends, heat protectant, scalp serum and hair oil to finish it off. Any other recommendations to not look insane tomorrow? Thanks everyone!",

I might just be going through a hating my hair phase, so maybe I need to just be talked off the ledge a little bit or given more ideas.\n\nMy curls are between 3a-3c. Right now it just reached shoulder length after I cut it to a chin length bob back in September of 2025. I am just unhappy with my hair, as many of my curls used to be kinkier and I had a lot of volume. I have gotten highlights in my hair in the past, but I have a great hairdresser and I noticed minimal to no damage in my hair. I typically keep up with my maintenance cuts whenever my bangs reach my eyes, but unfortunately I have hit a financial block, so haven’t been able to since my last cut in 2025.\n\nMy routine is filled with Moroccanoil everything, and I love them. I use their shampoo and conditioner Volume line, I use their Smoothing Lotion, Morocannoil Treatment, and their Voluming Mousse. I typically run my fingers through my hair with the Smoothing Lotion, then crunch the oil and mousse into my hair as I hang my head. I let my hair air dry. I put the oil treatment in my hair when I go to sleep, while also wearing a silk bonnet every night.\n\nMaybe I need a new product, or maybe I should cut my hair shorter, like a pixie? I’m just stressing out because I’m unhappy with my hair, and my hair is super important to me and my image!! Please lend me your thoughts and advice if any. Thanks everyone!!!!\n\nEdit: added more info to my routine!",
