I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

      "content": "I have both unfortunately. Mostly on my chest and butt. The acne on my butt probably because I'm sitting all day get really big and sometimes they're underneath the skin. I've been to doctors about it but said since it's not a real \"medical\" concern they can't do anything about it. I have Kaiser they won't let me see a derm unless it's a big \"medical\" concern or else I can only go to a cosmetic derm which means I'd have to pay out of pocket. Which will cost hundreds of dollars. If this doesn't work I will this is like my last attempt I've been dealing with this for almost 5 years now.\n\nSo far I've tried Amlactin 15% and Urea 10% lotion I've used them for months or years no change. I've tried Derm Doctor KP scrub and Panoxyl body wash, Stridex pads, Paula's choice bha. None of them have worked I've used all these for months too. I tried a Korean towel it broke me out lol.\n\nAlso I shower regularly right after every workout and if I get sweaty from sleeping which does happen I shower when I wake up. I change my bedsheets weekly or again if I get really sweaty.\n\nSo what products would you recommend for me? Right now I've been looking at trying for lotions Paula's Choice 10% AHA lotion, a lotion with Glycolic acid if you have a brand you recommend please let me know. Also I've been looking at trying a high percentage Urea cream like 20-30. A acne body spray I've never tried one but maybe it will help. For body wash I've been eyeing the KP exfoliating wash from touch skin or Naturium The Smoother Glycolic acid body wash.\n\nWhat do you think would work best for my skin? I have really dry skin too it constantly flakes too. Please help",

      "content": "I am devastated by what the salon did to my hair. The treatment looked smooth for exactly one day, but as soon as I washed it, the nightmare began.\n\nDuring the consultation, she mentioned that I had nice, thick hair and that it was very healthy, since it had been a year and three months since my last treatment. However, because there was still hair color in the mid-area, she suggested that we do keratin instead. I followed her advice and proceeded with the treatment, but that was when the hair devastation occurred.\n\nMy hair is now extremely dry, snapping off, and falling out in clumps 1 inch away from the scalp—I literally have a visible bald spot.\n\nI messaged her three days later to tell her my hair was falling out in massive amounts every day. On the fifth day, I went to her shop to ask for help because I was so stressed. However, she refused to take any responsibility, claiming instead that it was due to postpartum shedding.\n\nThis is not postpartum shedding. The hair is breaking one inch away from the scalp, exactly where she applied the product. The fallout started only after I washed my hair following her 48-hour post-treatment instructions. Postpartum shedding involves hair falling from the roots, and I did not have that issue before I went to her.\n\nWhen I asked for a solution to stop the breakage, her \"solution\" was to give me a leave-in conditioner and a serum she couldn't even identify what kind. So I refused to accept them. And Its an after care remedy not an actual solution to the problem.\n\nShe offered a partial refund, which I declined because money isn't the point; I wanted a professional anti-hair fall treatment to save my hair, but that never happened.\n\nShe also mentioned that the hair fall might continue, which was devastating to hear. I almost cried and felt completely helpless. She claimed I was being rude because I stood firm in my belief that she mishandled my hair, yet she still refused to admit fault. All I want is to stop the damage so I don’t go bald. I left her shop with no solution to the problem she caused.\n\nThis has been incredibly stressful. Save your hair and your money—go anywhere else.",

      "content": "So I’m 20 now and have recently noticed my face looking dry, dull and a lot older than it used to. I’ve finally got clear skin a few months after coming off birth control but I’m really not happy it’s so dull and old looking. I also noticed I’ve got some really prominent forehead creases that have appeared which I know is due to dryness.\n\nAt pm im currently using a chamomile cleansing balm which my skin loves followed by the welda skin food nourishing night cream which also seems to be working with keeping my skin clear. In the morning I don’t cleanse as this was drying out my skin I just put spf and a vitamin c moisturiser on and my makeup on top.\n\nI’m not sure why my skins so dry as my makeup and skincare are the same so maybe it’s me not producing as much oil and hormones etc with no birth control honestly I got no clue. However I have heard that retinol is great for making your skin more youthful and healthy looking.\n\nI was planning to start simple and just add the ordinarys 0.2% retinol serum into my routine.\n\nI have no clue if this is a good product or not so please give me any advice or recommendations. Also looking for a new spf that is lightweight and looks good under makeup.\n\nThanks in advance for reading my post and for any advice!",

I love how some curly people can be almost part-less, when your hair gains the volume like that so it doesn't have to always separate the same way.\n\n  \nMy typical routine is something like this: \n\n\\-Once or twice a month i'll use a clarifying shampoo\n\n\\-Co-wash 2-3 times a week with Suave Essentials conditioner\n\n\\-condition the length of my hair, comb it through, leave that in for a couple mins \n\n\\-fully rinse out conditioner with the comb/my fingers\n\n\\-after shower, i flip my head upside down and comb into curl clumps\n\n\\- scrunch in LA Looks gel with my head still upside down \n\n\\-plop with a microfiber t shirt for maybe 30 mins or so and let air dry after",
