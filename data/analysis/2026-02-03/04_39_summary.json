      "content": "Why is my hair straight at the roots and ends? Why is it only curly in the middle?\n\nFull disclosure, I used ChatGPT to blur the background and remove the local logo from my shirt.\n\nMy hair has gotten curlier as I’ve gotten older.  I noticed recently that the ends of my hair are not so curly or wavy. The roots of my hair have always been straighter as shown in the photo. Why is only the middle section curly??\n\nMy normal routine: I wash and condition my hair every other day usually. I rotate products. Today I used Elvive Dream Lengths Split End Sealing shampoo and conditioner. Other days I use OGX tea tree clarifying shampoo and conditioner. I also have a bottle of Mane ‘n Tail Herbal Gro shampoo that I randomly use sometimes. \n\nToday I washed and conditioned my hair this morning with the Elvive Dream Lengths, combed it, and let it air dry. This is my normal routine. I’ve been trying to grow my hair out to a longer length. I haven’t had a haircut in 6 months. \n\nSometimes, I scrunch my Prose curl cream in my hair or put OGX coconut milk hair oil on the ends.\n\nSometimes, about once a week, I blow dry my hair with my Shark blow dryer and use the round brush attachment to straighten it. I recently got the Tymo Curlpro Plus curling tool that I’ve used a few times. Other than those tools, I let my hair be. I’ve never colored my hair.\n\nWhy are the ends not curly?? Is it time for a chop?",

      "content": "(I'm new here so please be nice) I really really need help. My hair has always been fine, but it was never see-through. For the past 4 years I've been trying to grow it out and make it \"healthier\". It seems that it's only gotten worse and I literally want to cry. I feel so ugly and I can't just keep doing \"big chops\"... Please, I'll take any and all constructive advice. \n\nHere's what I'm doing:\n- oiling my ends 2x day\n- roots mask every wash day (from Lush)\n- flaxseed gel mask on lengths every wash day\n- leave-in conditioner every wash\n- air drying / diffusing with cold air\n- I haven't used heat in 5 (FIVE) YEARS\n- I sleep in a satin bonnet on a satin pillow case\n- usually wear my hair down or use a claw clip (no tight hair styles)\n- weekly scalp massages (doesn't seem to work) \n- iron supplements with Vitamin A\n- using a microfiber towel\n\nWhat I have tried and it didn't seem to help:\n\n- protein treatments (aphogee)\n- high frequency wand\n- hair oiling (scalp)\n- collagen supplements\n- hair growth supplements\n- eating more protein (struggling with this one)\n\nI've tried so many different products: from drug store to \"all natural\" to salon quality products.\n\nI attached some pictures with dates in reverse order and the last 4 pictures are what my hair used to be like with JUST a shampoo and conditioner. I've never had a short hair cut. It just broke off little by little leaving me with... this. \n\nI'm genuinely so exhausted and jealous of people who have long, healthy hair (I'm happy for them though and always compliment them). Seeing absolutely no improvement is so discouraging, it makes me want to hide in a cave and never come out. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. ❤️‍🩹 ",

My leaves in are applied by mixing the leave in conditioner (nickel sized amount) with the hair honey (a pump) and apply it everywhere but my scalp, taking a pump of the coconut milk oil and apply it everywhere I put the conditioner and hair honey, and then mix a quarter pump of each oil to out on my ends and scrunch. Every 2 weeks I use organic coconut oil everywhere but my scalp and use argan oil on my scalp. I wash my hair every 3ish days and let it air dry.\n\nMy hair is very dry, it MATTES into itself if I do not use my leave ins, even with conditioner in the shower. It is a nightmare to detangle, even with my detangling brush.\n\nI tried diffusing once but it didn't seem to work. As long as I use my leave ins, it is easy to brush when dry but it goes straight (barely wavy).\n\nI have satin pillowcases and I own a satin bonnet but I can't find it at the dollar moment.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Above is my skin getting a weird bumpiness to it and also looking red and irritated. I feel like it’s definitely not liking what I’m doing to it, but I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong 🥹\n\nFor the first 20ish years of my life I basically did no skincare at all. I washed my face in the shower with a body wash meant for babies and almost never lotioned because I despise the texture, but if I did it would be with Aveeno body lotion. On occasion in high school I would search around for a dedicated facial cleanser/moisturizer to use but even the most gentle sensitive skin marketed ones turn my entire face bright red and burning and leave me itching, it’s so annoying lmao\n\nFor instance I got LRP toleraine and it burned the shit outta me, same with Clinique 3 step\n\nBeen trying Cetaphil skin barrier intensive healing lotion and it also burns me somewhat, but also just kind of sits on my skin looking greasy and sweaty and prevents me from going to bed without wiping it off because it’s so uncomfortable to put my face near my pillow like that \n\nI got into this now because I want to do Tretinoin, I have noticed some fine line wrinkles starting to form on my forehead at an age where they really shouldn’t lol, probably because I spent 20 years not moisturizing almost ever \n\nAnyway. WTF DO I DO IF MY SKIN SEEMS TO REJECT LITERALLY EVERYTHING? Is there anything that couldn’t possibly irritate me. If I don’t feel like bothering with the redness I do a the ordinary aloe serum, the ordinary squalane, and my aveeno lotion, and call it a day \n\nYou don’t need to recommend an SPF I’m struggling enough as it is and I also don’t really leave the house lmao. The sun is not seeing me \n\nI think niacinamide burns me but I’m not positive. I tried hyaluronic acid (the ordinary) and made sure my face was wet but it still felt off, not bright red but weird and tacky and dry itchy\n\nI just want nice skin but I swear I looked better when I was dry as shit unmoisturized not in my lane not thriving LMAO\n\nLiterally any advice is appreciated. I have been using the aveeno more and if it’s okay I’ll just keep using it but it’s a body lotion so I’m not sure if people think it works for face moisture. And even when I use the gentlest of the gentle face cleansers for dry skin I feel like they still leave my skin feeling tight and a little itchy and I just want to give up and go back to the body wash for babies lol",

      "title": "Damaged looking hair in the winter!! Tried everything and desperate",
      "content": "I noticed that in the winter, my hair tends to look super weighed down, dull, frizzy, and stretched out. (Last photo is a bit old, but it is what my hair looks like at it’s best even with the added dye) I also move back and forth from somewhere with slightly more humidity and where it’s not as cold to somewhere where there is almost zero humidity and temperatures are freezing (my college). I also suspect that the water at my college (dorm) is hard water and is damaging my hair. I think, but can’t tell if one or both of those things are what’s affecting my hair since I do notice my hair getting worse at college. \nThis is my current routine (once- twice weekly) and products:\n1. Curlsmith reset detox shampoo (clarifying, every few washes), or regular Curlsmith shampoo every wash\n2. Not your mother’s curl talk bond building conditioner (rinse). \n3. Curlsmith weightless airdry cream, rake through + scrunch\n4. Curlsmith in shower style fixer strong hold gel (I use this generously), rake through + scrunch \n5. Bounce curl defining brush, scrunch. \n6. Diffuse until dry (hover dry until I feel a slight cast, then cup my hair with the diffuser, warm temp high speed)\n7. break gel cast with fructis oil\n8. I use the Curlsmith bond rehab salve mask once a month. (After shampoo and before conditioner)\nThe first two pictures were taken hours after I washed and styled my hair, and a week after I got a haircut with layers since at first I thought my length was weighing my hair down. As you can see, I tried to finger curl it later on to save it, but it didn’t work. Here are some other details that might be helpful:\n- I do not straighten my hair, and I don’t have any heat damage that I know of (last time I did was a year and a half ago)\n- I wear a bonnet when lounging around but not to sleep since I noticed it deforms my curls when on overnight. I just put my hair above my head to avoid sleeping on top of it.\n- I believe my hair is high to medium porosity\n- I get my hair professionally colored twice a year at a curl specialist (once fully and once for my roots) \n- I do not use a brush in the shower to detangle my hair as I’m worried about breakage. I finger comb.\nThis post is super long but I would appreciate any help!! I feel like I have tried everything and just find myself frustrated most days because of how much time and money I spend on my curls, but find that especially in the winter, it doesn’t last more than two days before I need to put it up because it’s flat, lacks definition, and frizzy. Is it the friction from wearing a winter coat? Is it the lack of humidity or the cold itself? Hard water? (Which I can’t fix given I’m in a dorm) Is there anything I can change about my routine/ products? I can’t tell if I need to add moisture, use less, more protein, less protein, I’m lost!\n",

I have not changed anything in my routine, and especially not my lip routine which is basically just Vaseline lip care in the little tubs. The only thing that has changed is I also have a tub of it that has vitamin e in it that I use occasionally in my bag.\n\nI have NEVER had a cold sore prior to this, and while I’m not saying it’s not possible but without getting TMI it would’ve had to be a coincidence as I make a conscious effort to not drink/eat/kiss people I do not know.\n\nI’ve seen posts in the past saying that the lip care from Vaseline is what cause it, but the OP’s said it took 2 weeks to go away which with all due respect is the exact same recovery time for a cold sore.\n\nIf you guys have experienced this or recognize it from the photos please let me know!

I don’t use gel because it weighs down my hair. I’m thinking of changing my products up to the innersense leave in and a different mousse (unsure what one yet). I also brush style the top of my head with the bounce curl volume brush. In the shower I use Rizos curls clarifying shampoo, and I rotate between rizos curls biotin shampoo &amp; conditioner and Camille rose guava slip shampoo &amp; conditioner. I use Curlsmith bond curl rehab salve every 3-4 wash days.\n\nBut i really want volume and I always see people saying layers will give more volume. I’m not that happy with my hair shape anyway so I’m thinking of changing it up. Any ideas/recommendations for haircuts to get or advice would be helpful!",

Is there something important I should know about retinol? All I know is that you must start with a little quantity twice a week and that you should do it during the evening.\n\nThis is a long post but I'd really like to be well informed about what I'll do to my skin, thanks in advance :)",

      "content": "Sorry for the long post, I want to make an important point for us women: the remedy already EXISTS — PREGNANCY.\nI’ve had AGA for 20 years, and with every pregnancy it made the AGA hair I had lost over the years grow back, even in very sparse areas. Hair loss stops completely by the 2nd/3rd month, and afterward my hair is amazing—thick, like in adolescence! It’s like a total reset of AGA.\n\nSince I started thinning again, I’ve become obsessed with this idea. I tried several protocols, sometimes extreme ones, to mimic pregnancy hormones: \n-contraceptive pills Diana 35 (several per day), -Androcur up to 100 mg\n-spironolactone 200 mg, \n-oral estradiol, high-dose injectable estradiol,\n-progesterone\n-finasteride 5mg\n-Minoxidil tropical, oral \nNothing worked, and the shedding continued exactly the same regardless of the regimen, even with DHT (and libido) at zero.\nWhat else can i try ?\n\nMany women see their AGA stop during pregnancy and regain beautiful hair. Dermatologists know this and tell us so. So why has no researcher ever looked into the mechanism, to find what helps regrowth?\nIt’s clearly a hormonal issue—but which one???? We’re always told it’s DHT, but I’m sure other hormones are involved: estrogen, prolactin, progesterone, hCG? Why not research this and formulate a pill with these hormones? We’re not asking for the lush hair of pregnancy—just to stop the shedding and maintain it would already be amazing.\nSo if there are scientists or knowledgeable people in this community who have an idea, I’d really love your opinions and suggestions.",
