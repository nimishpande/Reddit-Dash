      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I used to get a lot of and frequent acne around my mouth  (below the nostril and chin areas). I have tried using Azclear azelaic acid (1 month and a half), which seems to have worked for me. I have gotten far less acne the past month and even if I do, it is small and not long lasting. however, the result of my long war with acne, there are red marks and just overall unappealing redness in the area. I really want to get rid of the redness and marks, and even my skin tone. As you can see from my face, other parts of my face are fine, it's just my chin and below the nostrils.\n\nMy current routine-ish is to cleansing my face with QV cermaides cleanser. Then applying the Azclear on affected areas. Then until it is somewhat dried and absorbed, I moisturize with QV cermaides cream (it helps with preventing the peeling from the Azclear). If I go outside and get sun exposure, I apply sunscreen but otherwise, I sometimes skip that honestly.\n\nWhat products can I add to help improve the redness? I want to try benzoyl peroxide but don't know how it will work with azelaic acid. and I don't even know if it's useful for this case.\n\nThank you in advance for your time and help! Much appreciated!",

I don’t think my curls look too bad in this picture, maybe they can use a little more definition and shine, and maybe a little bit of a more layered haircut but I’m scared to do that cause I’m trying to grow out my hair. I don’t want to add any more volume to my hair bc it’s already pretty poofy. For context I typically use a moisturizing cream after washing my hair when it’s wet and then some gel, but if anyone has a method that would be better for my hair I’d love some advice.\n\nI’m mainly looking for tips for ways to wear my hair besides just straight down. I’d like to be able to do a half up half down style but I feel like that usually ends up in my hair looking like a triangle if I put up too much hair, and my hair is too thick and tangled to just clip a small part of it up without making it look messy. I’m just tired of always wearing my hair straight down, especially if I’m having a bad hair day it just looks poofy and even when I’m having a good hair day, it’s just a lot of volume and I’m not always in the mood for that look.\n\nAre there any other methods for wearing my hair (up, down, half up half down…) or would my issues be solved with a better curly hair routine or a better haircut? Maybe if I had a better curly hair routine my hair would look better if I wear it up?",

Now the back/underneath layer dries into a tube shape, like it was wrapped around a curling iron, and the rest of my hair needs a little encouragement to be wavy and cute. I've been trying lots of different routines, and it's always wavy but not usually that cute :)\n\nThe last couple times I washed and styled, my hair turned out almost perfect, but I keep getting a weird tangly \"rat's nest\" where it's curliest in the back. Everything looks great while I style and diffuse upside down, but it's like that back part gets stuck and tangled up when I try to flip upright again. What am I doing wrong?\n\nMy hair has a very soft, slippery finish, and I've had the most success cutting out heavy and conditioning products and focusing on volume and hold.\n\nRoutine:\n\nAussie Miracle Curls shampoo and conditioner every few days. Suave clarifying shampoo weekly.\n\nI'm upside down from conditioner on. \n\nRinse and squish out extra water, apply NYM Curl Talk Mousse from roots to ends with praying hands, scrunch. Apply NYM Curl Talk Gel with praying hands, focusing more on mids and ends, scrunch.\n\nI hover diffuse my roots and mids, then cup the ends and mids until almost try. All upside down.\n\nIt looks awesome until I flip over and everything gets all caught up in the back. Then I usually start messing with it trying to untangle it, and obviously it gets frizzy and even worse. Sorry I can't include a pic because I don't use a smartphone. Please help!",

I know this isn’t just a case of me having an uneven curl pattern (though that’s probably true too) because it’s different pieces of hair. I honestly don’t know why this happens and how to replicate it because it’s so random. I think I’m probably styling it wrong, and I also think my hair might be too heavy since it looks like stretched out spirals, though I’ve had it short before in my freshman year of highschool. It looked a bit more defined but not by much (though I’m not sure I was really styling it much that could be part of it.) I’ve tried changing my routine in different ways and while it helps it doesn’t fix it. Can someone please give me advice 😭 \n\nI did bleach and dye my hair, which I know doesn’t help but my hair doesn’t really seem changed at all.\n\nRoutine-\n\nCurrently I exclusively use Not Your Mother’s curl talk products. (With the exception of the clarifying shampoo)\n\n\n\nI wash my hair maybe once a week, maybe more but never more than a couple times a wee. When I wash it I use their bond building shampoo and conditioner. \n\n\n\nI do the rest of this everyday regardless if I washed it or not but I always wet it in the shower- while my hair is still wet I spray in leave in conditioner and brush with a curly hair tangle tweezer (I brush it as little as possible but I have to brush it daily since it gets extremely tangled). Then I put their curl defining cream through my mids to ends and make sure it’s completely distributed by brushing it through a little. If it ever starts to dry during this process I spray it with water. Then I add their curl definition gel then scrunch, then I let it air dry.\n\n  \nOh and i also clarify occasionally if it feels like there’s a lot of build up with Maui Moisture Scalp Care Clarifying Shampoo but I don’t count that as part of my routine since I don’t do it often.\n\n  \nI probably have a lot of product build up but I’ve gone through phases where I only used detangler and my hair was a lot poofier,  frizzier, and undefined.\n\n  \ntldr: My hair usually looks mostly wavy but curly at the end, but sometimes it makes ringlets/tigher curls and it’s different pieces and randomly",

Is that a thing?\n\n\\- glossier skin (not as important)\n\nEnvironment:\n\n\\- northern US, very cold winter. Hot, humid summer.

I bundle up but my face is exposed to the cold weather / wind.\n\n\\- Dusty environments, many home renovations requiring masks. Spending time in arenas, surrounded by dust/animal dander/hay.\n\n\\- very clean diet. Low/minimal sugar. Almost no processed foods. Some dairy.\n\n\\- I didn’t use to drink enough water but have significantly increased my water intake in the last couple months.\n\nIssues:\n\n\\- My skin feels very dry, no matter how much I moisturize.\n\n\\- lines on my forehead.\n\n\\- painful acne that takes a long time to heal.\n\nI am 24F, I feel like I should have better skin. The only time it’s clear is the couple days during my cycle. I get very deep, big “pimples” or surface level sores that nothing can be extracted from, but they take forever to go away. Lots of blackheads in my tzone. It seems strange that I have such a consistent wrinkle at this age, too. I have a bunch of little white texture spots around my mouth as well.\n\nI have all the products I use and pics of skin are in the attached link[Link to photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Zuii7P8q3JM9cpoo6), the only thing not pictured is the sugar scrub I use to exfoliate.

Gosh, that is painful, but this girl is going to help you make that girl go all head over heels for you. So it's your pretty old habit to keep forgetting to wash your hair, just like how you told her that you would call her in 5 minutes, but you never did. We are not doing that anymore. We are being responsible, and that starts with washing your hair every 4 days (not with your Dettol handwash but with a good hydrating shampoo). For the first-time shampoo user guys, I would recommend SCHWARZKOPF. Wait, the battle does not end here. After your hair completely dries up, you need to use a good hair growth serum and apply that generously on the parts where that girl can see your scalp (now that I have hit you right where it hurts, you will do your job perfectly). Some of the serums I can recommend would be the Inde Wild Moonlight Scalp Serum or The Ordinary Hair Growth Serum; both are tried and tested by me, so just go for it. Now, please don't start showing your boy traits and try to rush the process; it takes time, but you will see the visible results. Come on, you can't be 30 and then decide to go out on a date. Start working on it right now.",

At first, Rogaine spray but this gave me a very itchy scalp. I progressed to the foam which I applied far more than directed every night before bed, to both my thinning crown and my receding hairline.\n\nThis made absolutely no difference whatsoever, and my hairline continued to worsen.\n\nIn November 2025 I switched from Rogaine Minoxidil foam to Sons combination spray, which is topical Minoxidil, Finasteride and Tretinoin. I considered taking Finasteride oral, however due to some unrelated medical conditions I have, my GP recommended against it.\n\nThe instructions say to use 4 sprays per day, however I shower twice a day, so I have to apply it twice, and also four sprays simply doesn't cover the areas well enough, so I end up using between 5 and 8 sprays. I then massage it in with my fingers.\n\nDespite applying twice a day AND using more than directed, I am still experiencing absolutely no hair changes at all. Nothing. No vellus hairs, no density increases in what's currently there, nothing.\n\nTo summarise, I've been on topical Minoxidil for 15 months, before switching to topical Min+Fin for 2 months. Zero changes at all.\n\nJust after any tips, advice, or if anyone has experienced anything similar? Should I keep on the Min+Fin for longer? Or is it time to give it up?\n\nThanks",
