Oh and they always have a pretty good selection of shades. The black/red one is called 'Go Garnet' and I got another one that is a very very dark red but not as dark as the other one.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it.

      "content": "So I’m trying to get my hair to get more defined. That’s my goal here. I’ve been watching curl training/routine videos for a while, seen so many different things, but I wanted to ask for product recommendations to try and for people to tell me what does and doesn’t work for them so I can try and get some idea what to do. Also I don’t know how important this is, but my ideal hair length is what it is in slide 5. My hair is more of a zigzag than curly, some pieces in the front get coils, some are just barely a wave, and some are zigzags. \n\nMy routine kinda looks like this normally, I shower, and I’m either using As I am co wash or Kevin Murphy Killer Curls. After that, I use my holy grail product, Not Your Mothers leave in conditioner. I used to use their curl cream and gel, but after that not working the best I switched to Mielle’s curl smoothie which seems to work a little better, but I wanna try a different curl cream and see what works best for me. I don’t use gel anymore, should I? I used to use sea salt spray, I’ve heard it helps but I’ve also heard it dries out your hair so I rarely use it anymore. I also use the Mielle rosemary mint hair oil recently, as well as the Mielle weightless oil for my ends. (If you can’t tell, I’m a brand whore. Once I like something I wanna try their other stuff haha.) I saw a video online saying to use mousse again, and I don’t have any but a while ago I used to use NYM’s curl foam stuff, but my mom told me too much product will weigh the curls down so I stopped and pretty much just did leave in confirmed and curl cream until recently. This time I even added some hairspray, I saw someone say that and I thought I’d give it a try. The brand is Kenra, I used to use it for when I’d curl my hair when I was in middle school haha. I usually let it air dry as I never give myself enough time before work to dry it, but today I used my conair orange blow dryer, it was cheap and from Walgreens I didn’t think it mattered but now I’m starting to see it does. But yeah, that’s my curl routine, I did it differently today and didn’t seem to get any different results. \n\nWhen I was showering I doused my hair in conditioner and scrunched it, I even did the twisty curl things where you roll it and twist it out today, but I don’t know how to tell which way your hair curls so I kinda just pick a direction and alternate like I would if I was curling my hair. I don’t expect it to make an immediate difference, but it didn’t seem to do anything so I will keep trying that to see if it helps. Should I do that after showering too? \n\nI also am aware I don’t do the brush thing and then coil it around that, I’ve seen that a lot, but my brush is very old and needs to be replaced, plus it doesn’t seem to be the best for doing that so does anybody have any brush recommendations? And does it matter what kind of blow dryer/diffuser I use? If so, what do you guys use? Also, what kind do heat protectant should I use? I stopped straightening my hair ages ago and I don’t know what works good, I don’t even really have anything except the 10 in one Not Your Mothers stuff but I don’t count that, it’s just currently my only option and I really don’t wanna damage my small curl pattern haha. \n\nSorry, I know this is a lot but I’m looking for product recommendations to try out, things I could do differently, and just tips in general. What works for you that you would recommend for curl training? Thank you to anybody who responds with advice. ",

There is some discolouration on the folds of my neck. I’m skinny but have no idea how the folds are there on my neck.

But as of recently, I have noticed that my hair has thinned out on the sides of my head, and it’s scaring me a lot.\n\nFor context, I am a girl, + half white and half asian(Cambodian), and my mother is the asian one. Her hair is SUPER thick(like, extremely thick), and my hair was just like hers up until the time period I mentioned earlier. My father is white, and is currently, almost bald. Bald on the top of his head, with little stubbles on the side. I’m wondering if this may be a genetic thing(sadly), from my Dad’s side, or if it may be a hormonal thing/stress thing(as I got my period around 2022-2023), and also noticed a texture difference in my hair since then.\n\nConsidering that information, does anybody have any advice on how to re-thicken my hair, if it was already thick before? I’ve tried fish oil, but wasn’t consistent, so may try again. Anything is appreciated. Thank you.",

I was my face 2x with cerave foaming cleanser, at night I have to do this multiple times gently bc the sunscreen won't come off.\n\nAfter a while I noticed pesky white sebaceous filaments on my nose and cheeks especially. I used to have those all the time when I was younger and didn't care about skincare. Back when washing my face with water was enough 🤢 Anyway I have them now, again, and it's put me in panic mode.\n\nSo I started using a cica defense cream from a brand called preange instead but it didn't seem to really hydrate. It was just a thick cream. Tonight I just used cosrx snail mucin and my handy dandy torriden balaceful cream with no problem. On the raw spots, I put vaseline to help it heal. \n\nSo am I doing this right??? I have an intense urge to exfoliate. My skin is peeling and I can see the white residue from the sunscreen has kinda like stained it? I've washed my face a lot as gently as I could but the white residue doesn't go away. Other than that, my face feels fine. Desperate for an exfoliation, but fine I guess. Is this normal? \n\nI'm already broke from all the expenses so I can't buy anything 😪 I'm at home every day so if I should just not use the sunscreen (I think it's clogging my pores), then great. I have lots of sunlight here though. I just wanna know what I could do to kind of exfoliate in the safest way possible. \n\n",

I am also biracial, with a more white texture hair. Normally when I do my hair/morning routine, I use a leave in conditioner, a hair oil, and then a curl cream. (Aunt Jackie’s Leave in, NOU Moisture Oil, Miss Jessie’s Quick Curls cream). I am just wanting tips and ideas on how to bring my curls out more and what other products I can use. I also sometimes use Enjoy Shaping Lotion, Enjoy Texture Cream as well as Aunt Jackie’s Curl LaLa and Long Aid Curl Activator Gel. I also have a silk pillowcase and a bonnet I wear religiously. I’m in the awkward stage of growing this mess out too. ",
