      "content": "Hi! I have recently developed quite a lot of closed comedones on my face, especially my forehead and cheeks. I have a lot of tiny bumps on my forehead and a few big bumps + smaller ones on my cheeks. The photos attached are bad and don’t show the extent, I apologize.\n\nThis is always the type of acne I’ve primarily gotten, but usually just a little bit at a time. I’ve noticed it getting worse over the past few months or so, but now it is worse than ever before. My face used to feel fairly smooth, and now it is bumpy (yet still very smooth in the places where I don’t have any bumps, so I don’t think my skin has changed texture or anything?)\n\nMy body tends to react very physically to stress, so I know that has a lot of influence, and I am indeed very stressed this month. However, it was happening before as well, just not quite as bad.\n\nI also hate having a wet face, especially like washing/rinsing my face with water. If I need to do this every time I clean my face, it will not happen very often, so I need some other alternative methods. Due to this sensory issue, I do not wash my face (sorry).\n\nI do not wear makeup or put anything on my skin. I would like to wear sunscreen, but dread having to wash it off every night! I don’t moisturize, but my skin has always been very soft and seemingly healthy? My cuticles get very dry very easily, though, so I might just not know the signs.\n\nI am trying to figure out what type of products to use, but I am only getting overwhelmed with all the suggestions and options. Does anyone have a simple recommendation? \n\nThank you!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "So I’m trying to get my hair to get more defined. That’s my goal here. I’ve been watching curl training/routine videos for a while, seen so many different things, but I wanted to ask for product recommendations to try and for people to tell me what does and doesn’t work for them so I can try and get some idea what to do. Also I don’t know how important this is, but my ideal hair length is what it is in slide 5. My hair is more of a zigzag than curly, some pieces in the front get coils, some are just barely a wave, and some are zigzags. \n\nMy routine kinda looks like this normally, I shower, and I’m either using As I am co wash or Kevin Murphy Killer Curls. After that, I use my holy grail product, Not Your Mothers leave in conditioner. I used to use their curl cream and gel, but after that not working the best I switched to Mielle’s curl smoothie which seems to work a little better, but I wanna try a different curl cream and see what works best for me. I don’t use gel anymore, should I? I used to use sea salt spray, I’ve heard it helps but I’ve also heard it dries out your hair so I rarely use it anymore. I also use the Mielle rosemary mint hair oil recently, as well as the Mielle weightless oil for my ends. (If you can’t tell, I’m a brand whore. Once I like something I wanna try their other stuff haha.) I saw a video online saying to use mousse again, and I don’t have any but a while ago I used to use NYM’s curl foam stuff, but my mom told me too much product will weigh the curls down so I stopped and pretty much just did leave in confirmed and curl cream until recently. This time I even added some hairspray, I saw someone say that and I thought I’d give it a try. The brand is Kenra, I used to use it for when I’d curl my hair when I was in middle school haha. I usually let it air dry as I never give myself enough time before work to dry it, but today I used my conair orange blow dryer, it was cheap and from Walgreens I didn’t think it mattered but now I’m starting to see it does. But yeah, that’s my curl routine, I did it differently today and didn’t seem to get any different results. \n\nWhen I was showering I doused my hair in conditioner and scrunched it, I even did the twisty curl things where you roll it and twist it out today, but I don’t know how to tell which way your hair curls so I kinda just pick a direction and alternate like I would if I was curling my hair. I don’t expect it to make an immediate difference, but it didn’t seem to do anything so I will keep trying that to see if it helps. Should I do that after showering too? \n\nI also am aware I don’t do the brush thing and then coil it around that, I’ve seen that a lot, but my brush is very old and needs to be replaced, plus it doesn’t seem to be the best for doing that so does anybody have any brush recommendations? And does it matter what kind of blow dryer/diffuser I use? If so, what do you guys use? Also, what kind do heat protectant should I use? I stopped straightening my hair ages ago and I don’t know what works good, I don’t even really have anything except the 10 in one Not Your Mothers stuff but I don’t count that, it’s just currently my only option and I really don’t wanna damage my small curl pattern haha. \n\nSorry, I know this is a lot but I’m looking for product recommendations to try out, things I could do differently, and just tips in general. What works for you that you would recommend for curl training? Thank you to anybody who responds with advice. ",

      "content": "After almost a year and 2 hair cuts, I think I have a good routine down! First pic is from the start of this journey, second pic is today. My hair is pretty average, normal porosity, medium density, finer hair in front and medium coarse hair in the back. \n\nCurrent routine: Garnier Fructis clarifying shampoo followed with Shea moisture hydrating hair masque once a week\n\nConditioner only every other day or every 2 days depending on greasyness and laziness levels\n\nSquish to condish \n\nKnot Today leave in conditioner while hair is dripping wet in the shower, scrunch so my hair isn't dripping\n\nOut of the shower, I roughly section a top and bottom section and do the bottom section first. When I style the top section I split it into 2 sections, left and right\n\nFor each section, I spray with water to moisten the roots more, comb away from my scalp with a wide toothed comb, put a bit of Shea moisture whipped curl cream in my hands and emulsify (not really necessary but I bought it to try so I'm just trying to use up at this point). I rake the curl cream through, then using praying hands to reform the clumps and scrunch. I microplop with a microfiber towel, then put a golf ball size (more for the top section) of Not Your Mother's mousse and apply with praying hands and scrunch. Spritz some heat protectant, then I diffuse upside down till a cast has formed and my roots are like 75% dry. Then I pixie diffuse right side up, flipping side to side. I use a small rounded hair claw to clip my roots where my section is to get some volume\n\nI shower at night, so I leave the cast in my hair, put on a satin bonnet, and sleep. I scrunch out any cast in the morning. Usually it's a bit wild at the start of day 1, but it flattens a bit as the day goes on. For day 2 (and sometimes 3), I just spritz with water in the morning to dampen, scrunch a couple times, then scrunch out the cast after it's dry. \n\nLately I've been more into mousse more than gel. Gel gave me more definition, but mousse has given me more consistent results. Plus it's easier to sleep in the cast set by mousse than gel 🤭 the amount of mousse I use is probably a lot but it works surprisingly well",

Then when I scratch my back after a long shower SO much of this grey dead skin begins to pile under my nails, so I went to go look for a physical exfoliator to help me finish the job and get all the dead skin off.\n\nIve bought an exfoliating glove from target, wet it and rubbed it against my damp skin and only a bit of dead skin was able to come off onto the glove and there was still a bunch of it on my skin afterwards.\n\n I've used an exfoliating net but I'm sure it wasn't of quality or good enough as it didn't really cause a single dent to all of my dead skin. \n\nAm I using these products wrong? Do i need to splurge on a better quality exfoliant? What physical exfoliant will be as effective as me scratching/aggressively rubbing the dead skin off?? ",

Right now my routine is using the soothe shampoo and conditioner from Hibar (to work through a random itchy period). My schedule is day 1- wash and condition, day 2- wash, day 3- just rinse. I have always just slept with wet hair and in the past I’d wake up with cute curls that dried overnight. No other products. \n\nI feel like I’m walking the thin thin line of moisturizing enough to curl without weighing it down. \n\nThe second two photos might have been a time where I was using a moisturizing shampoo every other day to wash and conditioning maybe once a week. I believe it was the hydrating shampoo from Suavecita. But I’m not sure if it’s just the products? Could bad haircuts play a part? The water system? I’ve moved to another city between photos. I’ve definitely tried the moisture shampoo every other day since. I also had a great period where I was using a clarifying shampoo daily and conditioning every few days but that seems pretty intense now.?\n\nI’m thinking of trying a moisturizing shampoo again or even a sea salt spray? I really err on the side of less is more but I miss my messy curls and waves!!! ",

I didn’t do anything about it besides try “organic” and ”non-chemical” remedies like rosemary oil, but they did nothing for my hair besides making it greasy.\n\nI began 2.5mg oral min + 1mg finasteride at 19, but I sadly had sexual sides on fin. I kept pushing through for 6 months hoping it’d go away but it never did. I took a break for a few weeks to recover from the sides before restarting by lowering my fin dosage to 0.5mg 3x a week but it didn’t change anything.\n\nI decided to switch to 5mg oral min + 0.5mg Dutasteride 3x a week, because the state of my hair made me depressed plus finasteride didn’t do anything for me. I tolerated dut significantly better and started shedding about 4 weeks in. I shaved it off, (months 1, 2, &amp; 3 were the same length) and decided to do 3 prp sessions (I have no clue if this did anything for my hair) because I became pretty greedy and desperate. I’m debating if I should make the switch to daily Dutasteride since I might benefit from the benefits. Thoughts?\n\nI’m currently 5 months into treatment and going through yet another shed (look at the last image), I’ve had good improvements but still not enough density to cover those patches. I’ve recently added in topical finasteride and minoxidil at the start of the year, which may have contributed significantly to my current shed.\n\nCurrent treatments:\n\n0.5mg Dutasteride (M/W/F)\n\n5mg oral min (daily)\n\ntopical finasteride (0.1%) and min (5%)",

I think I may have messed up by taking hot showers every single day for the past 2 years.\n\nI’ve had some level of hair loss since I was around 17–18, but lately it’s gotten way worse. The weird thing is my scalp is totally clean, no dandruff, no itching, no redness. My hair has become super silky/soft, and combing doesn’t really do anything.\n\nAt this point I don’t know what my next step should be. Would seeing a dermatologist in the US be a good idea for this? Has anyone dealt with something similar or found anything that actually helped?\n\nAny advice is appreciated.",

All the while she is threading my eyebrows she always complain about how thick my hair is. I mean girl that is why I'm here! \n\nThen she'll suggest I just thread my upper lips also. But I tell her to wax it only. Guess what she did today. She was melting the wax for half an hour. Without waiting for the wax to cool down or anything she applied the hot boiling wax on my face. Oh my god it hurt and stung like crazy. And because the wax was too liquid-y, it slipped and fell on my chest. I'm so annoyed rn. I was not crying but tears kept falling out of my eyes. \n\nMY SKIN PEELED OFF BECAUSE OF HOW HOT THE WAX WAS!! \n\nI'm never going back again. I'm going to learn how to take care of my face myself. I hate her. I hate her. I hate her.\n\nAnd just for the context I'm not insecure about my facial hair but because I've thick and dense hair on my face. My face becomes really itchy and i hate it. \n\nI can't wait to earn and get everything lasered. ",
