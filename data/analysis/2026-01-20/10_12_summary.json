I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Most of the time, it ends up just looking like tight waves that curl at the end. But when I diffuse, the curls go up higher, and even where it’s not quite a curl I can see that there is a spiral, it’s just extremely stretched out. \n\nThere are also times when I don’t change my curl routine at all and I get full on ringlets and curls in some places. I know this isn’t just a case of me having an uneven curl pattern (though that’s probably true too) because it’s different pieces of hair. I honestly don’t know why this happens and how to replicate it because it’s so random. I think I’m probably styling it wrong, and I also think my hair might be too heavy since it looks like stretched out spirals, though I’ve had it short before in my freshman year of highschool. It looked a bit more defined but not by much (though I’m not sure I was really styling it much that could be part of it.) I’ve tried changing my routine in different ways and while it helps it doesn’t fix it. Can someone please give me advice 😭 \n\nI did bleach and dye my hair, which I know doesn’t help but my hair doesn’t really seem changed at all.\n\nRoutine-\n\nCurrently I exclusively use Not Your Mother’s curl talk products. (With the exception of the clarifying shampoo)\n\n\n\nI wash my hair maybe once a week, maybe more but never more than a couple times a wee. When I wash it I use their bond building shampoo and conditioner. \n\n\n\nI do the rest of this everyday regardless if I washed it or not but I always wet it in the shower- while my hair is still wet I spray in leave in conditioner and brush with a curly hair tangle tweezer (I brush it as little as possible but I have to brush it daily since it gets extremely tangled). Then I put their curl defining cream through my mids to ends and make sure it’s completely distributed by brushing it through a little. If it ever starts to dry during this process I spray it with water. Then I add their curl definition gel then scrunch, then I let it air dry.\n\n  \nOh and i also clarify occasionally if it feels like there’s a lot of build up with Maui Moisture Scalp Care Clarifying Shampoo but I don’t count that as part of my routine since I don’t do it often.\n\n  \nI probably have a lot of product build up but I’ve gone through phases where I only used detangler and my hair was a lot poofier,  frizzier, and undefined.\n\n  \ntldr: My hair usually looks mostly wavy but curly at the end, but sometimes it makes ringlets/tigher curls and it’s different pieces and randomly",

      "content": "After almost a year and 2 hair cuts, I think I have a good routine down! First pic is from the start of this journey, second pic is today. My hair is pretty average, normal porosity, medium density, finer hair in front and medium coarse hair in the back. \n\nCurrent routine: Garnier Fructis clarifying shampoo followed with Shea moisture hydrating hair masque once a week\n\nConditioner only every other day or every 2 days depending on greasyness and laziness levels\n\nSquish to condish \n\nKnot Today leave in conditioner while hair is dripping wet in the shower, scrunch so my hair isn't dripping\n\nOut of the shower, I roughly section a top and bottom section and do the bottom section first. When I style the top section I split it into 2 sections, left and right\n\nFor each section, I spray with water to moisten the roots more, comb away from my scalp with a wide toothed comb, put a bit of Shea moisture whipped curl cream in my hands and emulsify (not really necessary but I bought it to try so I'm just trying to use up at this point). I rake the curl cream through, then using praying hands to reform the clumps and scrunch. I microplop with a microfiber towel, then put a golf ball size (more for the top section) of Not Your Mother's mousse and apply with praying hands and scrunch. Spritz some heat protectant, then I diffuse upside down till a cast has formed and my roots are like 75% dry. Then I pixie diffuse right side up, flipping side to side. I use a small rounded hair claw to clip my roots where my section is to get some volume\n\nI shower at night, so I leave the cast in my hair, put on a satin bonnet, and sleep. I scrunch out any cast in the morning. Usually it's a bit wild at the start of day 1, but it flattens a bit as the day goes on. For day 2 (and sometimes 3), I just spritz with water in the morning to dampen, scrunch a couple times, then scrunch out the cast after it's dry. \n\nLately I've been more into mousse more than gel. Gel gave me more definition, but mousse has given me more consistent results. Plus it's easier to sleep in the cast set by mousse than gel 🤭 the amount of mousse I use is probably a lot but it works surprisingly well",

      "content": "so I've just started threading my forehead and eyebrows, and waxing my upper lips since November. I've kind of thick hair even on my skin. My mom says my thick hair is because I shaved my face with my father's razor when I was a kid. But I guess it's mostly genetic, anyway.\n\nI go to this local parlour in my mohalla. All the while she is threading my eyebrows she always complain about how thick my hair is. I mean girl that is why I'm here! \n\nThen she'll suggest I just thread my upper lips also. But I tell her to wax it only. Guess what she did today. She was melting the wax for half an hour. Without waiting for the wax to cool down or anything she applied the hot boiling wax on my face. Oh my god it hurt and stung like crazy. And because the wax was too liquid-y, it slipped and fell on my chest. I'm so annoyed rn. I was not crying but tears kept falling out of my eyes. \n\nMY SKIN PEELED OFF BECAUSE OF HOW HOT THE WAX WAS!! \n\nI'm never going back again. I'm going to learn how to take care of my face myself. I hate her. I hate her. I hate her.\n\nAnd just for the context I'm not insecure about my facial hair but because I've thick and dense hair on my face.

      "content": "Hey y’all! I’m 25 years old and I’ve had a very loose skincare routine for about 2 years now. My skin type is **dry** and face is usually clear aside from minor blemishes. I dipped my toe into the world of skincare because I really love achieving that glassy glow🌟 + ever since keeping up with a skincare routine I get a smoother base when I do makeup 🙂‍↕️\n\nRight now, I mainly use 3 products in this order: \n\n**1st** \\- B:Lab Matcha Hydrating Foam Cleanser \n\n**2nd** \\- Torriden Dive-in Hyaluronic Serum \n\n**3rd** \\- Etude Soonjung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream. \n\nI think this works pretty well for me, but I want to add some retinol, PDRN, &amp; SPF products to my daily routine. (Would adding all 3 of those be too much?) Any suggestions for products that work well with dry skin would be appreciated. \n\n\\^ Is there an order I need to follow when I eventually add these? And I’m still a bit clueless when it comes to which products actually need to be applied daily 😵‍💫\n\nI also want to add stuff to help with my main problem areas (maybe not to my daily routine, but definitely a few times a week?) \n\n**Need something to target extreme dryness** **during the winter months.**\n\nIn the winter, I always get dry patches around my face + my nose will begin to flake and peel. I’ve started using a humidifier and I think that helps a bit, but what products do you guys use to keep your face from shriveling up like a raisin? (Face masks, moisturizers etc ?) \n\n**Discoloration &amp; Hyperpigmentation?** \n\n(I tried to capture these in the photo I attached, but I’m not sure how noticeable it is on my phone camera 🙃 I still have the iPhone 12 sorry)\n\n\\- I have **dark circles** around my eyes which I’m pretty sure are genetic. Will any under-eye patches or brightening serums at least make it less noticeable? Please let me know which ones y’all swear by!\n\n\\- I also have **lighter spots** on my face that become pretty noticeable when I tan. Went to Brazil a few weeks ago and was promptly reminded of this 😕✌️ Showed it to my friend and she said it kind of looked like sun fungus, but we concluded that it probably wasn’t since it’s the same spots on my face every year that refuse to tan (and it never spreads) Does anyone know what products/treatments help with this? \n\nMy TikTok FYP is trying to convince me that microneedling is the best way to fix it 😅 Seems like a pretty expensive addition to a skincare routine…even if it’s only every 4-6 weeks… but I’m open to being influenced (and de-influenced lol) \n\n**TLDR: Need tips/suggestions on what to do for dry patches, discoloration (light spots, noticeable when I tan), &amp; dark circles around eyes. Also is microneedling worth it for any of the problem areas I mentioned? Or is that totally overkill** 🧐",

If so, how?\n\nI’ve been squeezing/stroking my nose to take those things out for the longest time (like everyday for more than 5 years) and constantly use one of those close up mirrors to remove them with the pimple extractors or tweezers. I go crazy if I don’t do it for like 3 days. My nose is always red for this reason and my pores are huge. I’ve tried RF microneedling to help with the size and potentially stop my habit but it didn’t help.\n\nI’m scared I’m going to end up with those gold mine noses you see on YouTube. Please tell me I’m not alone 😅",
