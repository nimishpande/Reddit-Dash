My hair is oily at the root and dry at the ends. I used to use the Maui shampoo and conditioner for the longest time but about a year ago I started using redken all soft shampoo and conditioner, then for about the last 5 ish months I switched to the redken extreme length shampoo. I think it damaged my hair I use no heat on it. It has white dots on the ends and it looks like split ends all around my hair. I am hoping to get a haircut this weekend. I just got the purology sheer shampoo and conditioner and the clarifying shampoo buttt I am not sure if that will fix my hair. Any help will be appreciated:) it is making me go crazy lol",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Hi there! Recently I went down the curly hair rabbit hole, and after 31 years of life I’m wondering if I could be missing out on my hairs full potential.\n\nFirstly, I wonder how most of you would describe my hair? I honestly don’t know if it’s curly or wavy, sometimes I get ringlets but they are usually underneath, so I think I must have an uneven curl pattern? \n\nSecondly, I wonder if some of you will have some tips and tricks for me based on my hair type. Here is what I have found so far: my hair seems to be softer and look less frizzy with less product. It gets poofy when I brush through it, so I avoid brushing when between washes. Plopping and air drying seem to be better for definition than diffusing. I have a lot of hair (length and thickness), which might be weighing it down, but honestly I don’t think I want to sacrifice my long hair. \nCurrent routine: wash 3x a week, using it’s a ten shampoo and conditioner, brush in the shower, apply ouidad mousse, brush again, plop and air dry, then oil.\n\nAny advice is welcome.\n\nThanks all!!",

I’ve noticed that a lot of the breakage is from my scalp. Super long pieces of hair will slowly pluck out throughout the day. And it’s really bad in the shower. I’m pulling out a lot of hair. \n\nAdditionally, my curls have begun to lose their pattern after the first day of showering. They scrunch up and stay pretty curly for the first day. But starting even the second day they start to straighten out now about halfway through my hair length. My scalp has also started to get greasy and my hair by my scalp gets flat way sooner than it ever did, infact, hair grease altogether is a super new change to my routine. Everyone has hair grease. But for really my whole life my hair never got greasy to the point i even noticed it. And now it is starting to happen even 2 days after showering. \n\nAny suspicions on what this could be? Are not your mother’s curls really rich in protein? And while my hair is clearly thinning and falling out maybe it’s too much? Any ideas would be appreciated. This is really taking a huge blow to my confidence and I’ve been super depressed about it. ",

      "content": "Hello skincare friends,\n\nI hope all is well. I come to you quite weary and defeated with my current skin situation and don’t know what to do next. I used to have such beautiful skin and I miss it so much. \n\nSkin type: oily, but cheeks are now quite dry, so I’ll say combination \n\nContext: in around March of 2025 I got my usual \n\nEltaMD sunscreen delivered from Amazon (😵‍💫 I know better now). It must have been a bad batch or something happened in transport because it caused severe burns on my cheeks. After Tacrolimus ointment prescribed by my dermatologist and then months of spironelactone, here is where I currently am: cheeks are still incredibly sensitive, red patches keep showing up on the cheeks, texture I’ve never had before, and acne popping up every day, with acne scars on the right side of my face that I’ve never experienced before. I’m a side sleeper which probably doesn’t  help the situation. \n\nI am now off the spironelactone and Tacrolimus which seemed to only put a bandaid on the actual issue. My dermatologist has seemed a bit dismissive and recommends extremely expensive products, so I am coming to you all with a desperate plea. What do you recommend I do at this point?\n\nAfter some trial and error, here is what my skincare routine looks like now:\n\nAM:\n\n1. Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser (used to use the gentle skin one but I just felt like my skin was never clean)\n\n2. CeraVe Eye Repair Cream\n\n3. EltaMD AM Therapy on forehead, nose, and chin, Illyoon Ceramide Eto Concentrate Cream on cheeks\n\n4. Colourscience Sunforgettable Total Protection\n\nPM:\n\n1. Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleander\n\n2. Cerave Eye Repair Cream\n\n3. Illyoon Ceramide Eto Concentrate Cream\n\n4. Use to use tretinoin but being that I’m trying to conceive, have stopped. Planning to look into azelaic acid\n\nAny and all recommendations are welcomed, and I greatly appreciate you reading this far. ",

They are primarily along my jaw and cheeks, I don't often get any major breakouts on my forehead or nose.\n\nI was prescribed Dapsone for the morning and Cabtreo at night by my derm about 8ish months ago. It was working great, with minimal purging and no dryness. My skin felt clear and good. II was using the aestura moisturizer, which was fine on my skin but felt really oily.\n\nFlash forward to now. Summer is over, and I wanted to get a moisturizer that was not as greasy on my skin. I switched to the Sephora Cica cream because it had great reviews and I know Cica to be good for stressed skin, which mine was starting to feel from the drier, cooler air. After using it for a few weeks I saw so many closed comedomes and papules on my cheeks again. I thought it was the moisturizer, so I tried the Torriden BALANCEFUL 5D Cica Complex Soothing Cream for Sensitive &amp; Redness Skin. I went for each of these because they were supposed to be noncomedogenic. Both have seemingly broken me out.\n\nCan anyone recommend a good moisturizer for my current routine? Or tell me what is causing the breakouts if not the moisturizer? I am still using the prescriptions, and I recently stared using the Purito Wonder Releaf Centella Toner, which I like.\n\nTrying to get to the bottom of this.\n\nTYIA!",

Double shampoo (one with Head &amp; Shoulders and another with whatever sulfate-free thing I can find)\n\n2. Conditioner (Shea Moisture's Coconut &amp; Hibiscus conditioner)\n\n3. Dry excess water with microfiber towel\n\n4. Leave-in conditioner (Gingermilk's Be Yourself leave-in)\n\n5. Curl cream (Pattern Styling Cream)\n\n6. Gel (Eco Style Krystal gel)\n\n7. Used to let it air dry but recently started diffusing on low heat\n\n8. Use a satin bonnet for bed and either let the hair loose or do a small puff with a silk scrunchie (hair is not enough for a pineapple)\n\n9.

      "content": "I'm a claw clip mom trying to finally figure out how to style my wavy/curly hair. It's always been wavy, but it's gotten curlier since I had my daughter a year ago. Now the back/underneath layer dries into a tube shape, like it was wrapped around a curling iron, and the rest of my hair needs a little encouragement to be wavy and cute. I've been trying lots of different routines, and it's always wavy but not usually that cute :)\n\nThe last couple times I washed and styled, my hair turned out almost perfect, but I keep getting a weird tangly \"rat's nest\" where it's curliest in the back. Everything looks great while I style and diffuse upside down, but it's like that back part gets stuck and tangled up when I try to flip upright again. What am I doing wrong?\n\nMy hair has a very soft, slippery finish, and I've had the most success cutting out heavy and conditioning products and focusing on volume and hold.\n\nRoutine:\n\nAussie Miracle Curls shampoo and conditioner every few days. Suave clarifying shampoo weekly.\n\nI'm upside down from conditioner on. \n\nRinse and squish out extra water, apply NYM Curl Talk Mousse from roots to ends with praying hands, scrunch. Apply NYM Curl Talk Gel with praying hands, focusing more on mids and ends, scrunch.\n\nI hover diffuse my roots and mids, then cup the ends and mids until almost try. All upside down.\n\nIt looks awesome until I flip over and everything gets all caught up in the back. Then I usually start messing with it trying to untangle it, and obviously it gets frizzy and even worse. Sorry I can't include a pic because I don't use a smartphone. Please help!",
