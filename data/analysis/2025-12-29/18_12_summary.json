The team was professional and explained everything clearly.\n\nNow 9 months post-op, I have zero regrets.\n\nPS: My current photo is in braids but trust me I am not keeping them for long and I only did them after my doctor approved it.

She used hard wax and complained that she didn’t care for the wax and has been trying to talk the owners into changing wax brands. She went over the areas multiple times burning me in the process but not even removing all the hair. Half the time she couldn’t even rip the wax off and had to just disintegrate it using wax off.  So now I’m heading to the beach with straggler hairs everywhere and not a finished job. What should I do? Shave the rest? Or go to a different waxing salon before I leave? How do I heal the already irritated kitty?! ",

My neck looked completely different from my face and chest, and it made me feel very insecure.

I was so happy that I didn't have diabetes . I had a glimmer of hope that the pigmentation might improve significantly with these creams. But I tried them for three months, and I didn't see much difference. I saw posts from some people who had seen results with brightening creams, so I tried Fix Derma's Skar Fix cream, but I haven't seen much improvement with that either.

I’m not joking, I ditched 2.5mg dut, stopped 5mg oral minox, stopped listening to dermatologists who are clearly paid actors, and just went upside down every morning. Blood finally reached my scalp the way nature intended and boom, temples filling in, crown closing, even my barber asking me what I’m on. This confirms my initial belief that the reason why we lose hair isn't DHT. It's the fact gravity is pulling our follicles back in, until they suffocate and explode. Doctors won’t tell you this because none of them can even hold a handstand for 10 seconds, so studies are limited for now. Might update in 6 months to see if this is permanent.",

      "content": "\nI have this weird type of acne that begins deep in my skin, I feel a slight pain in a particular area and slowly the surface rises into a painful swollen bump with no head no opening nothing. It's fully closed and it gets super dark very fast. Some times I manage to burst it open through a pore and it's just little pus with mostly blood. Most of the time I can't get an opening at all and it just settles down on its own after a long time but the hyperpigmentation stays. I get this form of pimple only on my cheeks especially below the cheek bone. Aside from this I do get normal pimples with heads that burst easily but they do leave behind very bad dark spots ( post inflammatory hyperpigmentation?)\nAny suggestions to fix this ? Preferably affordable ones. I live in UAE so idk if I can access local indian brands unfortunately.\n\nSome skin care I've tried - \nanua dark spot serum ( I'm pretty sure this made it worse ).\nEucerin triple effect serum with thiamidol ( weird texture under my moisturizer and make up so I stopped using it )\nCe rave retinol serum ( i don't think it did anything )\nThe ordinary glycolic acid ( again didn't see any effect ) \n\nMake up base i use daily-\nSunscreen (ok I forget most days )\nCeraVe moisturizer \nMaybelline fit me concealer , fresh tint and compact powder )",

      "content": "How do I introduce new products on sensitive skin?\n\nAs many other people, I got a few new products during the holidays this year and I have started using them. I’m only about 3 days into actually introducing these products into my skincare and I’m already seeing small breakouts in places I don’t typically break out. Obviously this could be due to typical crazy season stress or the fact that I began ovulating a few days ago. \n\nBut, I still wanted to ask about the right way to introduce new products to the skin, as I’d really like to become more understanding of my skin type and what I can do to improve it! \n\nI’ve added pictures of my old routine, which was literally just washing my face every night with the LRP medicated wash, and maybe twice a week using the COSRX soft peeling gel. Then finishing with ponds after the shower. In the mornings I’d just splash water on my face and use the ponds. \n\nI also added the “new routine” that I’ve been doing with the new products (place a close up image of the new products specific to my routine). I do the same cleansing process, but now I use COSRX hyaluronic acid serum, then the Pacifica retinoid serum, then FAB intense hydration moisturizer. \n\nDo I need to only add one product every couple days, every week? I’ve just been going in with all of them so I feel like with the breakouts maybe it’s all too much on my skin. Or does this simply mean the products just don’t work for me? ",

And yea, it happened but I think I’m just frustrated with my hair as a whole and not just because of this cut. My hair looks and feels healthy after the cut, which is why I did it. I spent 2years of growing it out cuz I couldn’t afford the $$$ haircuts and was finally fed up with how bad my ends looked. Bought hair cutting shears this weekend and cut it 2 days ago. Pics are my hair this morning. It’s looks extra raggedy now lol\n\nI think the culmination of seeing my hair look so chopped made me snap this morning lol. I’m just so exhausted by my hair with the amount of $$ I’ve thrown at it before (styling products, tools, hair cut $). And when I talked to my friend about it and how I was looking ‘choppy’ she had to say ‘well I wish I had your hair!’ 🤪… I’m pretty upset to say the least. I understand why she says that cuz curly hair can be so beautiful, but for some reason mine has never cooperated with me for the last 32 years. Doesn’t help that I have parents who think I should just brush it out and it will solve all my problems. SIGH! \n\nI guess to end this, does it look like there is anything I can do to fix my hair or should I accept my loss and keep it tied up for the next year or drop $300 for a stylist to look at it? Maybe I need to look up more hairstyles and see if that’ll save me..\n\nRoutine:\n1. I double cleanse with a clarifying shampoo (raw sugar the deep cleanse) and moisturizing shampoo (dove deep cleanse) then condition with dove intensive repair.\n2. After shower I use miss jessies leave in conditioner. After I section and comb out my hair with a touch of combing cream from Lola from rio. \n3. After brushing out, I use ouidad vitalcurl+ mousse and scrunch it in.\n5. Diffuse and pray",

      "content": "I’ve been battling an eczema patch under my right eye for the past two months, and I think all of the attempts at treatment have shattered my skin barrier. Any product I use that isn’t Gold Bond Healing/Aloe cream burns, makes my face red and splotchy, or makes the eczema even spread - the pimecrolimus cream I was prescribed did all 3, even when using Aquaphor/Vaseline in the mix. I would just stick with the Gold Bond, but it doesn’t seem to be helping the eczema go away; it just helps ward off the dry skin. My eye is still red and puffy.\n\nAfter doing research I’m either a) allergic/very sensitive to propylene glycol and hyaluronic acid or b) my skin barrier is just shot. I use Vanicream sensitive skin face lotion (the green bottle) for moisturizing after I wash my face, and I don’t remember it giving me such an intense reaction other than the first 1-2 times I used it. \n\nUnfortunately doing nothing seems to just make the dry skin under my eye come back. Constant cream applying wards off the dry skin, but my right lower eyelid is constantly red and puffy.\n\nI’m really unsure of what to do, I’m unsure if I should trust my derm (considering when I told her the pimecrolimus burned/made my face worse she said “that shouldn’t happen - try using Aquaphor with it” and that didn’t help), and it’s really left a dent in my self-confidence and also my right eye is pretty consistently itchy.\n\nHelp!",

      "content": "Lost my big curls\n\n\nHi there\n\nI used to have big curls but over the years my hair changed and it turned into smaller curls and now it’s stringy. I’m at a point where it’s hard to even get them defined. \nA few weeks ago my hair was so bad/dry that it could just stay in a 90 angle position after I removed my scrunchie.\n\nSince I dye it I thought Olaplex could help.\nSo I did a round of n°1 and n°2 and I’m now using n° 3 as maintenance. I did help a bit.\nBut since it seems I was lacking moisture itches wasn’t enough.\n\nI’m overdue for an haircut and I’m going next week so it might help but I still thinking something is missing to have better looking/healthier hair.\n\nI have to use a special shampoo for now for something I can’t mention here because of the rules of this sub.\nWhich of course affects my routine as I had to look for products that would not make the situation worse so my options are limited. \nOnce it’s under control I can reintroduce some products (I have a bunch from Shea Moisture, Giovinni, Olaplex…).\n\nSo right now my routine is:\n- Double shampoo with the special shampoo (otherwise I was using Smooth as Silk deep moisture shampoo from Giovanni) \n- I stoped using hair mask at the moment but before I either used Nutrafix hair reconstructor or Smooth as Silk deep conditioning hair mask both by Giovanni)\n- then I use an AA Keratin &amp; Peptide Hair Serum, a French local brand to squish to condish on wet hair. Before I used the Direct leave in Weightless conditioner from Giovanni which I loooove to squish to condish but I have to hold back right now. That’s when I try to form big clumps. I tried brush styling with a Denman but I was not really good at it I have to do so many sections that I was kinda discouraged. \n- at this step I would use a mousse (from Giovanni again) before gel but I couldn’t find one compatible with my situation now (I found some references that I could try to find online though but I’m hopeful I can soon come back to my usual products) \n- then I use gel with hyaluronic acid and flax seeds, same French local brand. It doesn’t have a strong hold. I have a better one from Kerasoin that again I can’t use at the moment. \n- then I diffuse on cold setting. \n- I sleep on a satin pillowcase and I’m waiting for a silk bonnet that I ordered.\n\nSo I know my routine is impacted by my situation right now but I’m hopefull I could use regular products soon. And even with regular products my hair doesn’t look much better.\nI wish I could have those big curls again that I like better than small curls but now it’s not even curly at all anymore it’s just stringy. \n\nAs for the haircut I’m going to go for a shag even though I don’t have much length to work with. For some reason it’s shorter behind, I think because I lost so much hair detangling as it was so dry. \n\nSo if you have any recommendations whether styling, products (even I can only use them once my situation is under control) or if you see what the problem could be (moisture, protein…?) I would be grateful.\n\n",

I'm sick of looking so haggard though so decided to invest in some products and give them a try, but I swear my hair looks worse than if I just did nothing. Here's what I did before the pictures:\n\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Nizoral shampoo (bc of sc4lp issues)\n2. Ethqiue wonderbar solid conditioner\n3. Lush Sticky Dates leave in conditioner raked through damp hair out of the shower\n\n4. Lush Curl Power curl cream scrunched through the damp hair\n\n5. Air dried, plopping for about an hour\n\nI never use heat on my hair and always air dry. UK climate. Virgin hair. \n\nI have never been able to tame my frizz. \n\nAny idea what's causing this? Untamable frizz and hair that mostly lays flat but curls up at the ends? sorry for the negative tone to this post, just so sick of nothing working and feel like shaving it all off sometimes.",

I have had curly hair my whole life and have worn it naturally my whole life. there’s not much advice I need bc i’ve gotten so used to caring for my own hair but i want y’all’s input on this. \n\ni use Tia’s 4U products (one of few that don’t have coconut as im super allergic) and recently bought the curl refresher spray. I used it twice and it made my hair dry, frizzy, and matted — especially the second time. i’ve only ever used curl refresher spray once before in the past and it was cantù brand. idk if it’s the brands i’m choosing or if it’s the product that may just not be for me. \n\nNotes: I have 3b/3c hair. Thick, long, dense.

      "content": "Finally, after years of battling with my very curly (3b/3c), fine, frizzy hair I think I managed to find what works. This is a personal victory for me as I have been struggling keeping my hair down after day 2 and resorted to always having by hair tied in a ponytail/pineapple tail as well as having to re-style every 3-4 days.\n\nThis pic is day 7 post wash (I am due today for a wash) so obviously it is not as defined and frizz free as a day one would be. Thus, the fact I could go this long without having to put my hair up and still looking good is a massive victory for me.\n\nRoutine:\nWash once weekly with Aveeno apple cider shampoo Kallos KJMN Keratin Regenerating Hair Mask each wash and leave for 10-15 min (before conditioner and detangling). Conditioner and brush detangling with Aveeno Apple cider conditioner. On wet hair (not soaking nor damp, somewhat in between) generous amount of Mielle pomegranate leave-in conditioner, focus more on length, first finger detangling and then Denam brush throughout for even distribution. Praying hands method with generous amount of ECO gel (favourite is olive oil) starting on lengths, and working my way up towards the roots, getting as close as possible to the scalp but without touching it, making sure hair is clumped and smooth throughout. I then flip my hair upside down and apply hair mousse (Elvive dream lengths  waterfall waves), scrunching up including roots. I leave air dry for maybe 10-15 minutes then I apply a heat protector (Redken one united 25) and a long bonnet hair drier and apply medium heat and speed and wait for it to dry. I break the cast by upside down scrunching using also Aussie Reconstructor hair oil. I also use the oil and tap water in between washes, upside down scrunching if I need to refresh my hair. I sleep with a silk bonnet and if I need to put my hair up for work, I use a hair claw and avoid pulling the sides to preserve the curls.\nI wanted to share this to haler anyone else who might be struggling with fine, unruly, frizzy hair as I once was!",
