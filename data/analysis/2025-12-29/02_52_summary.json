I really want to take care of my underarms. \n\nBackground:\n\n\t•\tI used razors only for several years (stopped \\~2 years ago)\n\n\t•\tAround a year ago, I had a wax burn from Rica wax\n\n\t•\tSince then, I switched to hard Brazilian wax, but I feel my underarm skin keeps getting worse\n\n\t•\tI have thick, coarse hair\n\n\t•\tMy skin is PIH-prone — even mosquito bites leave dark marks for months before fading\n\n\t•\tCurrently using Chemist at Play underarm roll-on\n\n\t•\tOccasionally used alum for odor\n\n\t•\tRarely used The Ordinary Glycolic Acid with a cotton pad\n\n\t•\tRecently exfoliated gently with Dove body polish (pink variant)\n\nCurrent issues:\n\n\t•\tPersistent dark pigmentation\n\n\t•\tUneven tone\n\n\t•\tBumps after waxing (they go away, but darkness doesn’t)\n\n\t•\tSkin gets irritated easily after hair removal\n\nWhat I’m confused about:\n\n\t•\tIs epilator better or worse than hard/Brazilian wax for someone like me?\n\n\t•\tShould I completely avoid root hair removal?\n\n\t•\tWould switching to a trimmer actually help pigmentation fade?\n\n\t•\tAny routines/products that helped you personally?\n\nLaser is not an option for me right now, so I’m looking for realistic, affordable solutions.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar underarm pigmentation or sensitive skin, I’d really appreciate your experience or advice 🙏\n\nPlease be kind — this is something I’m genuinely trying to fix.",

      "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m starting a healthcare job in a pediatric hospital and am wanting to hear how y’all are styling your hair at work. I know it differs from person to person, but I wanted to hear it all. \n\nFor reference, I have thick, layered 3a curls that go to my mid-back. My usual go-to styles are a ponytail or bun. Recently, I’ve noticed an increase in tangling, breakage, and damage with these two styles, so I’m looking for healthier alternatives. I don’t think “protective style” is the right term here, but I’m looking for styles that I can rotate, will keep my hair healthy during long work hours, and will help minimize breakage long-term.\n\nIn a perfect world, I would love to wear my hair down, but it gets overwhelming and I always pull it out of my face. I will be in and out of PPE with my hair tucked into a disposable scrub cap, so I don’t want to constantly be worrying about how it looks. I also won’t be able to wear a normal scrub cap regularly, or else I absolutely would! \n\nRecently, I’ve started twisting my hair up into a giant claw clip, which has helped some but causes headaches. I feel like there’s no winning lol. The crown of my hair has a lot of frizzies/fly aways, and I’m not sure if it’s further damaging my hair to keep gelling them down. I’ve read on here that braids/twists can be a great option, but I really struggle doing them on myself. My hair tangles, they never look quite right due to the frizziness of my crown, I get frustrated, and give up. But regardless, I will keep trying!\n\nI know this is a lot…but if anyone has any thoughts or advice, I would love to hear it!\n\nI appreciate y’all and thank you so much in advance! ☺️💜\n\n*TLDR*: Healthcare girly with thick, mid-back length, 3a hair looking for styling ideas that are not ponytails/buns (due to damage). Frizzy crown, has continuously failed at learning to braid/twist but willing to persist, any advice or words of wisdom are appreciated! \n\nCurrent routine (recently changed to help with damage from tangling and highlights):\n\n-Detangle with Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Curls Detangling Deep Conditioner\n\n-Wash with K18 Detox Shampoo\n\n-Lightly dry with a microfiber towel\n\n-Apply K18 Leave-In Molecular Repair Hair Mask (leave for 4+ minutes, no rinsing)\n\n-Apply Not Your Mother’s Leave-In Conditioner Spray\n\n-Apply Aussie Instant Freeze Maximum Hold Gel\n\n-Comb through hair with a wide-tooth comb and scrunch with gel\n\n-Clip roots with alligator clips for volume\n\n-Diffuse on warm heat, high speed\n\n-I sleep on a satin pillow case with my hair down (bonnets slide off of my head in the night and flatten my hair, pineappling causes irritation and build-up, willing to hear any advice on this as well!)

      "content": "Hello all, I have been incredibly lucky to not have suffered many skin issues. However that means I have no experience with dermatologist or much knowledge in this field. \n\nA couple months ago this capillary burst right on the tip of my nose. I have other ones but mainly concerned about just this spot. If it makes sense, I have one other on my face and a few on my thighs I’d be down to treat too. \n\nAnd while I’m in the office I have some scars that healed red and heard IPL might be the treatment course for all this.\n\nAnyway I’m 30, in Austin TX and not sure if I should see a dermatologist or esthetician? I saw some horror stories of people getting ipl and ending up with burn circle scars instead of the small dot. \n\nWhat cost is reasonable? Should I have insurance?\n\nI’m not usually this lost so I’ve been putting off seeking help but any advice is welcome and appreciated. Thank you",

      "content": "Hi everyone! Please remove if this isn’t in the right place!!\n\nRecently I’ve become so tired of everything to do with shaving, and I’m interested in some other options. I’ve been seeing a lot of different opinions on waxing versus sugaring, hair removal creams, and laser hair removal, but waxing seems the most appealing to me as of now. I’m not in the place financially to be able to afford professional waxing/sugaring. Therefore, at home waxing seems like the best option, so here are some of my questions. Sorry in advance for all of the writing, new things like this make me anxious, and I had some specific questions that I couldn’t find answers to elsewhere!\n\n1 What products are recommended? I’ve been seeing a lot of recommendations for roll on wax, accompanied by wax strips, as opposed to the melting wax (or whatever it’s called!) but I can’t seem to find a constant opinion on which one to use, and I’m really scared of damaging my skin!\n\n2 How much does it hurt, and are there any recommendations to help with the pain? I would think I have a pretty okay pain tolerance, I tweeze a lot and don’t really have a problem.\n\n3 How long should my hair be? I’m mainly interested in waxing my lower legs, and my underarms. The hair on my thighs grows a lot thinner so I’m not super worried about that, but if the pain isn’t terrible I might try waxing them as well. If I were to guess, I would say that the hair on my lower legs is about one centimetre right now.\n\n4 When should I exfoliate? I’ve heard that it is a bad idea to exfoliate the day of, and that gentle exfoliation is recommended a few days before hand. Also, when I do exfoliate I usually use sensitive skin soap and one of those exfoliating mittens, so would that be considered gentle?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Hi everyone! Recently I’ve become so tired of everything to do with shaving, such as how frequent I need to, the preparation, and still dealing with ‘strawberry legs’ after so much research. I’ve been seeing a lot of different opinions on waxing versus sugaring, hair removal creams, and laser hair removal, but waxing seems the most appealing to me as of now. For some background, I’m a 17 year old girl in high school, trying to save for university, and I’m not in the place financially to be able to afford professional waxing/sugaring. Therefore, at home waxing seems like the best option. Here are some of my questions!\n\n1. What products are recommended? I’ve been seeing a lot of recommendations for roll on wax, accompanied by wax strips, as opposed to the melting wax (or whatever it’s called!) but I can’t seem to find a constant opinion on which one to use, and I’m really scared of damaging my skin!\n\n2. How much does it hurt, and are there any recommendations to help with the pain? I would think I have a pretty okay pain tolerance, I tweeze a lot and don’t really have a problem. (I also have a cat that scratches which doesn’t bother me!)\n\n3. How long should my hair be? I’m mainly interested in waxing my lower legs, my underarms, and my upper lip. The hair on my thighs grows a lot thinner so I’m not super worried about that, but if the pain isn’t terrible I might try waxing them as well. If I were to guess, I would say that the hair on my lower legs is about one centimetre right now.\n\n4. Can I use babypowder to negate the risk of tearing skin? I’ve recently gone down a rabbit hole of waxing research, and I’ve seen some scary stories of that happening, which is why I find myself so scared, but I’ve heard that using baby powder can help the wax stick to the hair and not the skin!\n\n5. When should I exfoliate? I’ve heard that it is a bad idea to exfoliate the day of, and that gentle exfoliation is recommended a few days before hand. Also, when I do exfoliate I usually use sensitive skin soap and one of those exfoliating mittens, so would that be considered gentle?\n\n6. How much should I worry about possible sensitive skin? I do have sensitive skin on my face, and I’m not really sure how that correlates with my legs, but should I be weary of what products to use, based on sensitive skin? In correlation with that, what products can I use after to help keep my skin moisturized and healthy?\n\nSorry for droning on!! I find myself getting anxious about trying new things like this, and these were some of my questions that I couldn’t find solid answers to elsewhere! I’d love to hear advice from anyone, and genuinely, all advice is super appreciated!! ",

It looks alr but I’m wanting to do half black and red or red roots and black ends but I’m not sure if it’s too early to do anything? I’ve been dyeing my hair for a few years now and I’ve had 1 other chemical straighter about 6 years ago. I’m leaning more towards the red roots and black ends atp so any advice would be helpful! ",

For about 10 years it was straight not pin straight but if I got out of the shower and brushed it would dry straight. So my haircut is still coming off being cut for straight hair. Lots of razoring in there. Well perimenopause has decided to remodel and the curls are BACK! 🤗 Buuut… products and procedures have changed a lot in 10 years. I need help with finding a gel that doesn’t flake when I break the cast. I love the way Paul Mitchell’s Super Clean Sculpting Gel forms my curls. It controls frizz and gives me volume but it’s so flaky. The curl creams I’ve tried just make my hair a frizzy mess even when paired with gel. I’ve tried NYM spray gel and it doesn’t have enough hold for my hair. \n\nRoutine:\n\nShampoo and conditioner: Pacifica Scalp Love\n\n1st Mousse: NYM Curl Talk \n\n2nd Gel: Paul Mitchell Super Clean Sculpting \n\nI break the cast with Kristin Ess Air Dry Crème (I ONLY use this once my hair is dry). \n\nI occasionally use aerosol hair spray at the roots. \n\nI have a pixie cut and my hair doesn’t tangle easily so I don’t brush it often but when I do it’s between applying conditioner and rinsing it. Brush recommendations appreciated as well. \n\nTYSM",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI have been battling whiteheads on my chest for 2 years now and I'm at my end. I have tried (almost) EVERYTHING and nothing helps. For some background: I'm 36 and I eat well, I'm active and don't have any health issues other than migraines. Sometimes the flare up is way worse and sometimes better than the picture.  I have a solid skincare routine. I'm on birth control pills (Yaz) and have been for 3 years (and previously my teens/20's). Yaz has stopped my periods completely. This seems to pop up the second week after the placebo pills. I've also been tested for any sensitivities and allergies and nothing. I've tried all the skincare including Hypochlorous sprays, specialty bacteria soaps, all the acids etc. I've also tried not using anything! I've tried elimination diets, fixing my gut flora, teas and herbs. Cutting sugar out has helped a little but not by much. I don't sweat alot, I usually wear loose clothing and tank tops. I drink a ton of water! So I'm at a loss. The only thing I haven't tried is going off BC and it's not really an option for now. I know I'm at the age for my hormones to be outta whack and I'll have to be changing the type of BC I'm on soon and all those good things that come with age, so I have a feeling that might be a part of this!\n\nIf anyone out there has any info or advice, I would love to hear it!",

      "content": "I don’t understand my hair! What am I doing wrong?\n\nHello! I recently discovered that I have either dead curls or dead waves… I think 😅\n\nMy hair has been getting increasingly curly since I began treating it as such 3 months ago, but the last month, it’s been getting flatter and straighter again. There has been some change in my routine but I can’t tell what caused the change!\n\nI know this is a long post with lots of pictures, but I’d rather explain the entire process rather than leave something out that may be important. I’m at a loss for what to do and would greatly appreciate guidance! 🙂‍↕️❤️\n\nFirst, context/backstory:\n\nWhen I was younger my sisters and I all had curly hair, but they disappeared as we got older. My hair has always been thick, fluffy and my poor mother’s nightmare to control, especially if it har been raining. My hair has been very dry, despite my oily scalp and has been easily damaged especially with split ends\n\nThat being said, my hair changed for the worse when I was 15 after I had to take a lice cure that made my hair so greasy that despite showering 5 times a day for a week, we had to go to the hair dresser to get it fixed. Greasier scalp and flatter hair since.\n\nPrior to this journey my hair has been as I described earlier, as well as  appearing straight (unless exposed to water). I’ve noticed parts of my hair also especially the ends, begin curling in the evenings.\n\nMy hair journey now:\n\nOne day after I had heard some curl routines and people say that a good indicator to whether or not you may have curls is how your hair shapes when wet. My hair has always curled ringlets (although loose) when wet, so just for the fun of it, I scrunched in some aragan hair oil I had lying around and lo and behold, they stuck! 🥳 (🌄Pictures 1-3 show oil only).\n\nAfter this, I bought curl shampoo, curl masque and curl cream all by “by viera”. I know they’re probably not the best products I could get, but I was testing it out in a money friendly way 😅(🌄Pictures 4)\n\nBecause of finances I haven’t gotten a proper scarf/bonnet to protect my hair at night so I currently put it in a loose bun at night.\n\nI wash my hair about every 2nd day (sometimes I get lazy and it is 4 days between 🙂‍↕️).\n\nI use the shampoo twice as I can’t seem to spread it properly the first time, but it foams like crazy the second time. I first spread it by massaging into my scalp, then use my fingers to comb it into the rest of my hair.\n\nAt first, I used the masque once a week, I now use it about once a month. I first spread it into my palms before I comb it into my hair using my fingers, starting the combing close to my scalp. I then scrunch my hair lightly, then let it settle for about 5min before rinsing out and follow the same process with my conditioning. I’ve changed conditioner multiple times because of travel, but more often than not, I’ve been using “L’Oréal Elvital Hyaluron plump conditioner”, but I want to change to a lighter one.\n\nThen I scrunched with a towel til it was between wet and damp, before scrunching in the curl cream. I’m unsure how wet my hair is supposed to be when adding cream so guidance would be appreciated 🙏😅\n\nPs. I did mostly NOT use the hair oil after getting products. I did occasionally scrunch it in after it was fully dry however. Sometimes it did wonders, others it made the curls stretch out somewhat.\n\nit seemed as if this routine did decent though, as my hair got more shape, and the curls stuck for multiple nights and until next wash day. I could also tell it helped as the curls formed stronger and more ringlets when wet over time and they appeared faster after getting out of the shower or even stayed the entire time during the shower. When I first began my hair had 1-2  really long ringlets when wet, whereas now, I have 2-4 ringlets per “section” when wet. Curls and waves with curly hair routine are the only ones that have ever stuck for more than a couple hours regardless of how much heat or hair spray I’ve used so this was big for me, even though they stayed low. (🌄Pictures 5-8 show progress after getting products but not fully dry)\n\n💨I think the first decline happened sometime after I got a hairdryer with a diffuser attachment. Prior to this, I let my hair dry on its own after the towel scrunch + curl cream.\n\nThe first few times I used the diffuser it was AMAZING! My hair has never looked so good!! However, since then, it’s been decreasing and my hair when dry has gotten flatter, and almost straight again except a few curves at the ends of my hair and some parts with curling “ringlets” but are fluffed out and not very defined. (🌄Pictures 9-12)\n\nI have tried different temperatures and air intensity and I turn it off whenever I move to a new section. I know for a fact I have over diffused in the past but try not to now, yet my curls have slowly been stretch stretching out and dry messy and wavy with slight curling.  (🌄pictures 13-14)\n\nIt should be noted that soon after i got my diffuser i both cut my hair and dyed it but i was able to style it perfectly fine that same night, a friend of mine also gave me some curl gel which i used the night I dyed my hair and it worked well, but after using it for a while it seems as if it might be weighing my hair down so i’m going to switch to mouse and see if that works better.(🌄picture 15 shows the day i cut and dyed my hair about 2 weeks ago)\n\nFor refresh I spray water on my hair til it’s damp, let my hair absorb the water and shape itself before scrunching in curl cream. I let it dry naturally after that.\n\nHere is an overview of the products I used:\n\n\\- By Veira curl shampoo\n\n\\- By Veira curl masque\n\n\\- L’Oréal Elvital Hyaluron plump conditioner\n\n\\- By Veira curl cream\n\n\\- Curl Girl curl Gel\n\n\\- Alama Hydra cristalli liquid Aragan hair oil\n\nI am at my wits end and about to throw in the towel and accept that my hair will always be straight. Any tips for what I should try before calling it quits?\n\n(🌄photos 16-17 shows my hair today)",

      "content": "I went into a curly cut salon for my first cut by a professional in 4 years and I absolutely hate it. I’m so mad about it every day since getting it ($107 down the drain) that I am trying to find ways to hide it until it grows back out. I am beginning to realize I need to just cut it myself (as I have been for the last four years) or if I want anything more than trimming ends I need to be extremely specific and not even bother going to a premium priced “curly” salon.\n\n I told the stylist what I didn’t like about my hair and what I think I needed to fix it but ultimately left it to her (being a professional) to make the call. I wanted more lift at the roots and it to be layered. She added ONE layer at the top making for some wispy hair that sits oddly at the crown and then seemingly cut it straight across at the bottom leaving a weird shape almost squared. It’s essentially one length and looks absolutely ridiculous when I do my usual routine of washing with V&amp;Co. Wave shampoo &amp; conditioner, style soaking wet with Ouidad humidity defense strong hold gel and let it air dry. \n\nI know what works for my hair and this cut isn’t that. I’ve been living with this bad cut for two weeks and thought maybe time would help but I’m about to just take scissors to it myself to “fix” the heaviness. The only thing stopping me is knowing I already have more length off than what I want and it takes FOREVER to grow and show length. Should I just wait it out and let it grow or go to some generic salon (not specialty curl stylists) and tell them give me layers in hopes they understand and fix it..? \n\nWhen looking from front it sits just as flat and lifeless. It has nothing to do with the way I style it, it’s 100% the cut. I tried on day 2 to cut some layers randomly but that did nothing to fix the horrible one length curtain of hair. ",
