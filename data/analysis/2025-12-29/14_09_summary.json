      "content": "My neck is pigmented, I don't know for how long, but as I grew older, it started looking worse, especially when I wore deep-neck clothes. My neck looked completely different from my face and chest, and it made me feel very insecure.  Recently, I consulted a dermatologist, who suggested some creams like Glyco 6 and Epilite hydroquinone, and also recommended a test for insulin resistance, as I have mild acanthosis on the one side of my neck but test came normal. I was so happy that I didn't have diabetes . I had a glimmer of hope that the pigmentation might improve significantly with these creams. But I tried them for three months, and I didn't see much difference. I saw posts from some people who had seen results with brightening creams, so I tried Fix Derma's Skar Fix cream, but I haven't seen much improvement with that either. And now I'm following this current skincare routine👇🏽\n\nAm routine \nCera ve sa cleanser &amp; dove soap on alternate days\nDeconstruct 10% niacinamide &amp; 0.3% alpha arbutin acid \nMoiz lmf 48 face &amp; body lotion\nSunscoop brightening sunscreen\n\n Pm routine \ncleanser \nMoisturizer \nAqurea 20% cream &amp; skarfix tx cream on alternate days\n Has anyone been able to fix their pigmentation? please share your experience.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

Most of the time I can't get an opening at all and it just settles down on its own after a long time but the hyperpigmentation stays.

Preferably affordable ones.

      "content": "Lost my big curls\n\n\nHi there\n\nI used to have big curls but over the years my hair changed and it turned into smaller curls and now it’s stringy. I’m at a point where it’s hard to even get them defined. \nA few weeks ago my hair was so bad/dry that it could just stay in a 90 angle position after I removed my scrunchie.\n\nSince I dye it I thought Olaplex could help.\nSo I did a round of n°1 and n°2 and I’m now using n° 3 as maintenance. I did help a bit.\nBut since it seems I was lacking moisture itches wasn’t enough.\n\nI’m overdue for an haircut and I’m going next week so it might help but I still thinking something is missing to have better looking/healthier hair.\n\nI have to use a special shampoo for now for something I can’t mention here because of the rules of this sub.\nWhich of course affects my routine as I had to look for products that would not make the situation worse so my options are limited. \nOnce it’s under control I can reintroduce some products (I have a bunch from Shea Moisture, Giovinni, Olaplex…).\n\nSo right now my routine is:\n- Double shampoo with the special shampoo (otherwise I was using Smooth as Silk deep moisture shampoo from Giovanni) \n- I stoped using hair mask at the moment but before I either used Nutrafix hair reconstructor or Smooth as Silk deep conditioning hair mask both by Giovanni)\n- then I use an AA Keratin &amp; Peptide Hair Serum, a French local brand to squish to condish on wet hair. Before I used the Direct leave in Weightless conditioner from Giovanni which I loooove to squish to condish but I have to hold back right now. That’s when I try to form big clumps. I tried brush styling with a Denman but I was not really good at it I have to do so many sections that I was kinda discouraged. \n- at this step I would use a mousse (from Giovanni again) before gel but I couldn’t find one compatible with my situation now (I found some references that I could try to find online though but I’m hopeful I can soon come back to my usual products) \n- then I use gel with hyaluronic acid and flax seeds, same French local brand. It doesn’t have a strong hold. I have a better one from Kerasoin that again I can’t use at the moment. \n- then I diffuse on cold setting. \n- I sleep on a satin pillowcase and I’m waiting for a silk bonnet that I ordered.\n\nSo I know my routine is impacted by my situation right now but I’m hopefull I could use regular products soon. And even with regular products my hair doesn’t look much better.\nI wish I could have those big curls again that I like better than small curls but now it’s not even curly at all anymore it’s just stringy. \n\nAs for the haircut I’m going to go for a shag even though I don’t have much length to work with. For some reason it’s shorter behind, I think because I lost so much hair detangling as it was so dry. \n\nSo if you have any recommendations whether styling, products (even I can only use them once my situation is under control) or if you see what the problem could be (moisture, protein…?) I would be grateful.\n\n",

My forehead and nose tend to flake a bit too, some bumps that seem to look like closed comedones are visible on forehead and chin as well. But overall the rest of my face is quite balanced, maybe a bit dull if anything. I don’t even use any cleanser, since it makes my face feel tight and flaky for days after. I use miccelar water instead.\n\nMy hydration routine is simple: Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream morning and evening after washing face, I also tried using a second moisturizer before this one for extra hydration - Skin1004 Centella Hyalu-cica Moisture Cream. It is not helping much, I think maybe I need some kind of serum instead? I’ve used The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Serum in the past, I think it helped with hydration, but my skin felt bumpy while using it.\n\nIt is winter right now where I live, during summer my face is more balanced, sometimes a bit oily around nose.\n\nAny recommendations to manage tightness and flakiness, and clear up the tiny bumps on chin and forehead?",

      "content": "I'll be 22 years old in a month. I've used a low dose of retinol by the brand Good Molecules about a year ago but wasn't consistent with it for more than 2 weeks. I'm American but have been living in Korea for a month now and will continue to be here for one more month before heading back home. Of course with my stay here, I have completely dove into all the K beauty having a full skin care routine for the first time in a year. I've used chemicals and had a very consistent skincare routine for a while before taking this year long hiatus from everything other than a basic skin cleanser so my skin isn't sensitive to chemicals on the face. With that being said, i've now been using this 5X retinol complex + PCL serum by CNP Lab for a month now in my nighttime skincare routine with no problems of sensitivity, burning, or peeling. In fact I've noticed the fine lines I do have reduce a lot. Of course I'm using other products such a hyaluronic acid, sunscreen, vitamin C, and others that also probably add to my improvement in overall skin texture. I started using retinol based products as preventative skin aging, and have seen that it's okay and sometimes recommended to start in your 20's, but I'm also seeing things about how it can have the opposite effect and reduce natural collagen production in the skin the older I get. I've been feeling and looking fine now but it has only been a month of these products, also i'm not using a straight retinol now but more so a retinol complex. Am I okay to continue use? Or should I stop before I create damage?\n\nI have an oily T-zone, the rest of my face is just normal. Not too dry, not too oily. I don't really have issues with acne other than the occasional pimple around my menstruation cycle. I am however more prone to blackheads, clogged pores, and textured skin, but my routine so far has seemed to help with all of those. I don't know if this matters but I'm mixed with black and white so i'm rather tan, but I know everyone should use products to prevent sun damage no matter what complexion you are, so I am religious about sunscreen use. ESPECIALLY with using chemicals like retinoids.",

They smell the same to me...and I am really wondering whether these are essentially the same product with a different packaging, to encourage consumers to buy one full set for \"bond repair\" and a second (identical but with a different color packaging) full set for \"gloss lamination\".\nAlso, is there a difference between them and high-end bond repair products like Eprés, Olaplex, K18?",

Plain products are available only at a very higher price; mid and lower ranges are filled with unwanted acids. Even if it is available without acids- 2 months later the company rebrands and remakes the same cream as “enriched with hyalaron”.. ! Is it compulsively “essential” to use acids nowadays? Why is this trend emerging I don’t get it. Or is it just companies catering to the growing demands? \n\nAnd also please name some moisturisers (not those which will break my pocket) which are lightweight on skin, and actives free. ",

I used to have chronic cystic acne and took Accutane for about 2 years a few years ago (an absolute lifesaver). Now I no long have cystic acne and just get an occasional pimple or two when my cycle is approaching. I also have some mild scarring nothing too deep. \n\nMy issue is when it comes to the anti-aging side of products I’m really indecisive on what products to get. Like there’s so many out there! \n\nAnother big issue is mine is that I have very sensitive skin that is prone to redness and irritation. I have to be very careful with what products I use. I tend to notice that a lot of anti-aging products either have too much fragrance or tend to be harsh on sensitive skin. \n\n So what I’m trying to find is what are some anti-aging products or anti-aging lines any of you recommend that’s ideal for sensitive skin, doesn’t break the bank, and actually works?
