After years of self diagnosis, different routines, and senselessly applying actives to this area it is still a big problem for me and nothing I’ve done has seemed to help!\n\nI have this strange texture around my mouth which remains even without active acne. Any previously active acne leaves a red mark where it was, whether it was picked or not. There also seem to be some closed comedones toward the sides of the chin.\n\nNow I’m wondering if it is just a damaged barrier problem?\n\nMy skin has looked like this for close to ten years, so I’m ruling out that it will go away with time.\n\nAnyone I mention this to says they don’t see anything wrong with my skin, and while I do understand that it is minor compared to the skin problems many others face, but it is a bit of an insecurity for me and I feel a bit hopeless on how to tackle it!\n\nI would appreciate any help or advice you have!",

I decided to grow it out. Partly because I wanted a change, and partly because my boyfriend was getting a little too weirdly obsessed with it (that’s a whole other drama lol).\n\nBut now that my hair is shoulder length and \"normal\"... I feel invisible??\n\nI swear, when I had that bob, I could roll out of bed in an oversized t-shirt and look \"chic\" or \"artsy.\" Now when I roll out of bed, I just look like a mess. I look in the mirror and I don't see \"that girl\" anymore, I just see... me. And it’s boring.\n\nI remember asking in my old post, \"Is the bob doing all the work?\" and I think I found the answer. YES. It was. The bob was the main character and I was just the host body.\n\nI have this insane urge to chop it all off again. I miss feeling effortless. I miss the \"vibe\" I had. But I also worked so hard to grow it out, and everyone says long hair is prettier/more versatile/whatever.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? Did you go back to the short hair, or is this just a phase where I need to learn to style my long hair better? I feel like I lost my superpowers.",

I’ve lurked in this group for about a year now, and finally decided to make my own post. \n\nToday, I tried out the Ulta Hair Analysis (curiosity), and I was shocked that it said my hair was mostly wavy and only 2% curlies. I think it’s very wrong. My hair is mostly 3B curls, I think, with some 3A and a couple 3C curls for funzies. Am I crazy?! Is the app crazy? Anyone else get weird, inconsistent results either this app? Definitely hoping for the latter, hah!\n\nI’ve had very short, curly hair with teeny tiny baby bangs most of my whole life. A few years ago, I decided to see what my hair would look like if I grew it out. Now that I’m getting older and have some grey hairs, it’s so fun to watch as it swirls with the curls. I’m also learning how to diffuse and am looking for my favorite products/ gels. \n\nAnyways, if you have similar hair to mine, what’s your favorite cream and gel? \n\nRoutine: Usually, I shampoo/condition w/ either Redken frizz dismiss, Biolage Hydration, or Ouai for medium hair. \n\nThen, I use Unite/Boing Curl 7-Seconds detangler spray (right after the shower, brush upside-down while wet), scrunch with Pattern Leave-in Conditioner (still upside-down), and Curl Keeper liquid gel (upside-down). I just ran out of the Curl Keeper gel, and have been trying out Eco Gel. \n\nAfter upside-down scrunching, I flip my hair back, and diffuse by cupping the curls up to my scalp until mostly dry or I let my hair air dry. It takes a long time to dry. Still learning how to care for my hair as it gets longer and more grays appear.\n\nHappy New Years, my curly headed folks!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

After years of self diagnosis, different routines, and senselessly applying actives to this area it is still a big problem for me and nothing I’ve done has seemed to help!\n\nI have this strange texture around my mouth which remains even without active acne. Any previously active acne leaves a red mark where it was, whether it was picked or not. There also seem to be some closed comedones toward the sides of the chin.\n\nNow I’m wondering if it is just a damaged barrier problem?\n\nMy skin has looked like this for close to ten years, so I’m ruling out that it will go away with time.\n\nAnyone I mention this to says they don’t see anything wrong with my skin, and while I do understand that it is minor compared to the skin problems many others face, but it is a bit of an insecurity for me and I feel a bit hopeless on how to tackle it!\n\nI would appreciate any help or advice you have!",

I believe I have medium porosity, medium density and medium/coarse finish. My routine for this result was in order: Aveeno Apple Cider Vinegar Clarifying Shampoo, OGX Volumising Biotin &amp; Collagen Shampoo, Moogoo Milk Protein Coditioner (scrunched out with water), Microplopped with a cotton shirt until damp, Cake Curl Crush Jelly Scrunched in on damp hair (admittedly I didn't use a lot because I was scared it would be way too crunchy) and diffused upright leaning over slightly. Is there anything better I coild be using instead? Particularly shampoo. I really want to try a protein mask aswell and i have bought the curlsmith bond repair salve to try, do I use it before or after shampoo? I plan on getting a haircut soon too so if there's any advice on what to ask for in terms of a cut that will enhance my waves but keep a decent amount of length let me know! 🙏🫶",

      "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m starting a healthcare job in a pediatric hospital and am wanting to hear how y’all are styling your hair at work. I know it differs from person to person, but I wanted to hear it all. \n\nFor reference, I have thick, layered 3a curls that go to my mid-back. My usual go-to styles are a ponytail or bun. Recently, I’ve noticed an increase in tangling, breakage, and damage with these two styles, so I’m looking for healthier alternatives. I don’t think “protective style” is the right term here, but I’m looking for styles that I can rotate, will keep my hair healthy during long work hours, and will help minimize breakage long-term.\n\nIn a perfect world, I would love to wear my hair down, but it gets overwhelming and I always pull it out of my face. I will be in and out of PPE with my hair tucked into a disposable scrub cap, so I don’t want to constantly be worrying about how it looks. I also won’t be able to wear a normal scrub cap regularly, or else I absolutely would! \n\nRecently, I’ve started twisting my hair up into a giant claw clip, which has helped some but causes headaches. I feel like there’s no winning lol. The crown of my hair has a lot of frizzies/fly aways, and I’m not sure if it’s further damaging my hair to keep gelling them down. I’ve read on here that braids/twists can be a great option, but I really struggle doing them on myself. My hair tangles, they never look quite right due to the frizziness of my crown, I get frustrated, and give up. But regardless, I will keep trying!\n\nI know this is a lot…but if anyone has any thoughts or advice, I would love to hear it!\n\nI appreciate y’all and thank you so much in advance! ☺️💜\n\n*TLDR*: Healthcare girly with thick, mid-back length, 3a hair looking for styling ideas that are not ponytails/buns (due to damage). Frizzy crown, has continuously failed at learning to braid/twist but willing to persist, any advice or words of wisdom are appreciated! \n\nCurrent routine (recently changed to help with damage from tangling and highlights):\n\n-Detangle with Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Curls Detangling Deep Conditioner\n\n-Wash with K18 Detox Shampoo\n\n-Lightly dry with a microfiber towel\n\n-Apply K18 Leave-In Molecular Repair Hair Mask (leave for 4+ minutes, no rinsing)\n\n-Apply Not Your Mother’s Leave-In Conditioner Spray\n\n-Apply Aussie Instant Freeze Maximum Hold Gel\n\n-Comb through hair with a wide-tooth comb and scrunch with gel\n\n-Clip roots with alligator clips for volume\n\n-Diffuse on warm heat, high speed\n\n-I sleep on a satin pillow case with my hair down (bonnets slide off of my head in the night and flatten my hair, pineappling causes irritation and build-up, willing to hear any advice on this as well!)

      "content": "I started with my meds in September with 1mg finestride and topical minoxidil 5% twice daily.\n\nI took vitamins daily, dermastamped once every week with 1mm needles.\n\nKeto conazole shampoo every 3rd day.\n\nAnd sometimes I used a peptide oil from the ordinary in the morning instead of the topical minoxidil.\n\nI didn’t see anything results in the first 30 days… then got a shed, which made everything worse. \n\nBut 60 days in when I reached November. I saw some mini hairs come up. \n\nThe pictures Is the results I’m seeing from Nov 12 vs. Dec 28 (46 days difference). You can see the \"bullseye\" closing up and the spiral getting tighter.\n\nIn the beginning of November I added 1.25mg of oral minoxidil to test side effects… I had nothing big… just a little under eye puffiness that got fixed after I started drinking 3L of water a day.\n\nI bumped up the dose to 2.5mg of oral minoxidil. \n\n and reduced the topical minoxidil to once in the evening.\n\nI train consistently 5x a week, and is eating around 140g of protein everyday. I honestly think having excess protein in the body helps the hair…\n\nBut yeah!!! I’m stoked. Because they say the best results are 12-18 months in… and I’m in month 4\n\nThanks to this community ❤️",

      "content": "I’ve been one of those people who can’t accept that I was blonde as a child but I am no longer blonde, so I’ve been bleaching my hair for a while. During that time, my hair was really thin and damaged. Anyway, finally decided (reluctantly) to embrace my roots. So this is about 9 months of no bleach or dye. My hair is growing and feeling healthier. My question is, what do I do next to help with the grow out? Does it look really bad the way it is? I live a pretty low maintenance, low effort lifestyle so it doesn’t bother me that it’s not perfect, but I feel like it looks bad now that I have substantial root growth. Should I dye the lower half of my hair to match my natural? Is there a gloss or toner that could help? Obviously I know I’m in need of a trim, etc. Any advice is appreciated! ",
