The team was professional and explained everything clearly.\n\nNow 9 months post-op, I have zero regrets.\n\nPS: My current photo is in braids but trust me I am not keeping them for long and I only did them after my doctor approved it.

My neck looked completely different from my face and chest, and it made me feel very insecure.  Recently, I consulted a dermatologist, who suggested some creams like Glyco 6 and Epilite hydroquinone, and also recommended a test for insulin resistance, as I have mild acanthosis on the one side of my neck but test came normal. I was so happy that I didn't have diabetes . I had a glimmer of hope that the pigmentation might improve significantly with these creams. But I tried them for three months, and I didn't see much difference. I saw posts from some people who had seen results with brightening creams, so I tried Fix Derma's Skar Fix cream, but I haven't seen much improvement with that either. And now I'm following this current skincare routine👇🏽\n\nAm routine \nCera ve sa cleanser &amp; dove soap on alternate days\nDeconstruct 10% niacinamide &amp; 0.3% alpha arbutin acid \nMoiz lmf 48 face &amp; body lotion\nSunscoop brightening sunscreen\n\n Pm routine \ncleanser \nMoisturizer \nAqurea 20% cream &amp; skarfix tx cream on alternate days\n Has anyone been able to fix their pigmentation? please share your experience.

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

It's fully closed and it gets super dark very fast. Some times I manage to burst it open through a pore and it's just little pus with mostly blood. Most of the time I can't get an opening at all and it just settles down on its own after a long time but the hyperpigmentation stays. I get this form of pimple only on my cheeks especially below the cheek bone. Aside from this I do get normal pimples with heads that burst easily but they do leave behind very bad dark spots ( post inflammatory hyperpigmentation?)\nAny suggestions to fix this ? Preferably affordable ones. I live in UAE so idk if I can access local indian brands unfortunately.\n\nSome skin care I've tried - \nanua dark spot serum ( I'm pretty sure this made it worse ).\nEucerin triple effect serum with thiamidol ( weird texture under my moisturizer and make up so I stopped using it )\nCe rave retinol serum ( i don't think it did anything )\nThe ordinary glycolic acid ( again didn't see any effect ) \n\nMake up base i use daily-\nSunscreen (ok I forget most days )\nCeraVe moisturizer \nMaybelline fit me concealer , fresh tint and compact powder )",

I just have large pores and a bit of texture on my skin, mostly nose, cheeks, and a small area of my chin right below my lower lip.\n\nMy current routine is:  \n(In Shower) Cetaphil Water-Based Cleanser  \n(In Shower) Nose Exfoliator Tool  \n(In Shower) Palmer's Cocoa Butter Skin Therapy Cleansing Face Oil  \n(Out of Shower) Cerave Moisturizer\n\nI recently got two new products, but I do not know how to add them to my routine.  \nThe Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution  \nTree Hut Sugar Scrub\n\nQuestions:  \nHow is my current routine?  \nWhere can I add in these new products?  \nIs there any product type I am really missing as part of this routine?\n\nTIA!",

      "content": "Lost my big curls\n\n\nHi there\n\nI used to have big curls but over the years my hair changed and it turned into smaller curls and now it’s stringy. I’m at a point where it’s hard to even get them defined. \nA few weeks ago my hair was so bad/dry that it could just stay in a 90 angle position after I removed my scrunchie.\n\nSince I dye it I thought Olaplex could help.\nSo I did a round of n°1 and n°2 and I’m now using n° 3 as maintenance. I did help a bit.\nBut since it seems I was lacking moisture itches wasn’t enough.\n\nI’m overdue for an haircut and I’m going next week so it might help but I still thinking something is missing to have better looking/healthier hair.\n\nI have to use a special shampoo for now for something I can’t mention here because of the rules of this sub.\nWhich of course affects my routine as I had to look for products that would not make the situation worse so my options are limited. \nOnce it’s under control I can reintroduce some products (I have a bunch from Shea Moisture, Giovinni, Olaplex…).\n\nSo right now my routine is:\n- Double shampoo with the special shampoo (otherwise I was using Smooth as Silk deep moisture shampoo from Giovanni) \n- I stoped using hair mask at the moment but before I either used Nutrafix hair reconstructor or Smooth as Silk deep conditioning hair mask both by Giovanni)\n- then I use an AA Keratin &amp; Peptide Hair Serum, a French local brand to squish to condish on wet hair. Before I used the Direct leave in Weightless conditioner from Giovanni which I loooove to squish to condish but I have to hold back right now. That’s when I try to form big clumps. I tried brush styling with a Denman but I was not really good at it I have to do so many sections that I was kinda discouraged. \n- at this step I would use a mousse (from Giovanni again) before gel but I couldn’t find one compatible with my situation now (I found some references that I could try to find online though but I’m hopeful I can soon come back to my usual products) \n- then I use gel with hyaluronic acid and flax seeds, same French local brand. It doesn’t have a strong hold. I have a better one from Kerasoin that again I can’t use at the moment. \n- then I diffuse on cold setting. \n- I sleep on a satin pillowcase and I’m waiting for a silk bonnet that I ordered.\n\nSo I know my routine is impacted by my situation right now but I’m hopefull I could use regular products soon. And even with regular products my hair doesn’t look much better.\nI wish I could have those big curls again that I like better than small curls but now it’s not even curly at all anymore it’s just stringy. \n\nAs for the haircut I’m going to go for a shag even though I don’t have much length to work with. For some reason it’s shorter behind, I think because I lost so much hair detangling as it was so dry. \n\nSo if you have any recommendations whether styling, products (even I can only use them once my situation is under control) or if you see what the problem could be (moisture, protein…?) I would be grateful.\n\n",

I'm sick of looking so haggard though so decided to invest in some products and give them a try, but I swear my hair looks worse than if I just did nothing. Here's what I did before the pictures:\n\n\nRoutine:\n\n1. Nizoral shampoo (bc of sc4lp issues)\n2. Ethqiue wonderbar solid conditioner\n3. Lush Sticky Dates leave in conditioner raked through damp hair out of the shower\n\n4. Lush Curl Power curl cream scrunched through the damp hair\n\n5. Air dried, plopping for about an hour\n\nI never use heat on my hair and always air dry. UK climate. Virgin hair. \n\nI have never been able to tame my frizz. \n\nAny idea what's causing this? Untamable frizz and hair that mostly lays flat but curls up at the ends? sorry for the negative tone to this post, just so sick of nothing working and feel like shaving it all off sometimes.",

      "content": "I’ve been battling an eczema patch under my right eye for the past two months, and I think all of the attempts at treatment have shattered my skin barrier. Any product I use that isn’t Gold Bond Healing/Aloe cream burns, makes my face red and splotchy, or makes the eczema even spread - the pimecrolimus cream I was prescribed did all 3, even when using Aquaphor/Vaseline in the mix. I would just stick with the Gold Bond, but it doesn’t seem to be helping the eczema go away; it just helps ward off the dry skin. My eye is still red and puffy.\n\nAfter doing research I’m either a) allergic/very sensitive to propylene glycol and hyaluronic acid or b) my skin barrier is just shot. I use Vanicream sensitive skin face lotion (the green bottle) for moisturizing after I wash my face, and I don’t remember it giving me such an intense reaction other than the first 1-2 times I used it. \n\nUnfortunately doing nothing seems to just make the dry skin under my eye come back. Constant cream applying wards off the dry skin, but my right lower eyelid is constantly red and puffy.\n\nI’m really unsure of what to do, I’m unsure if I should trust my derm (considering when I told her the pimecrolimus burned/made my face worse she said “that shouldn’t happen - try using Aquaphor with it” and that didn’t help), and it’s really left a dent in my self-confidence and also my right eye is pretty consistently itchy.\n\nHelp!",
