      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "title": "1.5 Months on Tretinoin (0.025%): Smooth Sailing &amp; My \"No Purge\" Strategy for Beginners!",
      "content": "\n\nHie everyone, I just hit the 1.5 month mark using Tretinoin, and I am honestly still in shock. I started with 0.025% Tretinoin (Tretin 0.025) and, I have to knock on wood here, Seriously, no skin drying, no irritation, no burning, no awful purge. I think I might actually be God's favorite child, hahah!\n\nJokes apart, I've been on a long skincare journey. I've tried every active under the sun (kojic acid, glycolic acid, etc.), but nothing has given me this glassy, flawless, glowy, smooth skin like Tretinoin has. I seriously wish I'd started sooner.\n\nFor context, I have extremely oily skin and also deal with hyperhidrosis, but focusing on barrier health and diet seemed to be the winning combo.\n\nMy Winning Routine &amp; Key Factors\n\n• Amount: Use only a pea-sized amount for your whole face.\n\n * Application: I've been strictly using the sandwich method (moisturizer, Tret, moisturizer). \n\n* The Pressing Technique: DON’T rub it into your skin, PRESS it into your skin! I found that gently pressing the product in is WAY less irritating for me.\n\n * Moisturizer MVP: The Dot &amp; Key Barrier Repair Moisturiser has been an absolute game-changer. It's truly a godsend for barrier protection.\n\n* Eye Safety: Don’t get it in or too close to your eyes, as it can cause excessive eye dryness. I counter this by using gel drops before bed.\n\n * Internal Support: I've been focusing on a clean diet, packed with lots of fresh veggies and fruit, which definitely helps my skin from the inside out.\n\nI'll be continuing this routine consistently until mid-December to complete a full three-month run.\n\nA Word of Caution: Tretinoin Can Be Fickle!\nWhile my start has been great, I want to emphasize a serious point for everyone in the community. Tretinoin can be a very fickle product!\n\nThe possible downsides are often very dependent on a person's skin and are not necessarily universal. Tretinoin can cause skin sensitivity, redness, eye problems, perioral dermatitis, and lots of other things.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, 1.5 months is a very short amount of time. A lot of people don’t experience these issues until several months or even years into their Tret journey. That is to say, stay vigilant about keeping a healthy skin barrier and monitoring the condition of your skin closely. I love what Tret has done for me, but it demands respect!\n\nAdvice for Tretinoin Beginners: What I Learned: \n\nIf you're hesitant or scared about starting Tretinoin, here is the regimen and advice that worked for me:\n\nTLDR: My Top 3 Lessons\n\n * Start slow!! When I say slow, I mean SLOW, slower than you think you need to.\n * Simplify your routine and cut out all other actives. Let Tretinoin do the work.\n * Don’t overwash to keep your skin barrier intact and hydrated.\nUsage and Application Tips\n * Amount: Use only a pea-sized amount for your whole face. I dot it all over first, and then gently spread it in.\n * The Pressing Technique: DON’T rub it into your skin, PRESS it into your skin! I found that gently pressing the product in is WAY less irritating for me.\n * Eye Safety: Don’t get it in or too close to your eyes, as it can cause excessive eye dryness. I counter this by using gel drops before bed.\n\nGeneral Tretinoin Commandments\n\n * Waxing Warning: For gods sake, make sure to take a week off of it before waxing brows (or any facial hair). You will regret it otherwise!\n\n * Night Use Only: Tretinoin is very drying and irritating, so only use it at night.\n\n * SPF Mandatory: Wear SPF in the morning (and reapply!).\n\n * Moisturize: Give your skin a break whenever it needs it. Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!\n\n * Moisturizer Recommendations: If you need heavy-duty hydration, I recommend CeraVe. If you can get your hands on it, definitely try Vanicream—it’s excellent for sensitive and compromised barriers!\n\nConclusion\n\nFor me, the key was ramping up usage very slowly and keeping Tretinoin as the only active ingredient.\n\nHas anyone else had a smooth start like this that later changed? I'm curious to hear your long-term experiences! \n",

Since I have never had any skin problems my whole life, even whenI was a teenager (maybe it's genetic, because my mom had the same thing), this is a sad new issue for me. In addition, I constantly have blackheads on my nose(and suddenly I’ve got a few of them above my lips :&lt; ), and I don't know how to get rid of them.\n\nMy routine consists of cleansing my skin with CeraVe, applying I’m from rice toner, then applying niacinamide serum in the morning and Timeless vitamin C serum in the evening. Finally, I use Beauty of Joseon moisturizing cream.\n\nI would be very grateful for any suggestions on which products you would recommend or what I need to change. Thank you very much in advance for your time and help!",

It kinda feels weird because I feel so insecure abt it especially the marks that just won't go away also I've already visited a dermat i spent like sm on skincare that she recommended but still ntg works \n\nAlso my skin is prone to cc and papular acne near my nose like close to my eye area but since I've started tret it's under control otherwise that was a headache,i have combination skin and like my T zone is prone to these bumps \n\nI’m already on tretinoin (since July) and using niacinamide + sunscreen daily, but these new pimples keep popping up and healing into dark spots. I’m guessing it might be hormonal, but not 100% sure.\n\nIf anyone’s gone through something similar what actually helped calm your breakouts and fade the marks?

      "content": "Hi! So a new Chinese friend of mine is almost 40 years old, but she looks like she’s sixteen (and that’s not even an exaggeration). Whilst she has amazing skin, it’s not immune to blemishes and irritation, which means whatever she is doing to maintain the best version of her skin, she’s doing a freaking phenomenal job.\n\nShe’s told me she’s tried sooo many different avenues and these are the main findings she’s concluded to.\n\nSPF ALWAYS. NO TOUCHING THE SKIN WITH UR DIRTY NAILS. Face masks all the time. (She’s got the budget)\n\nNow this is where I wanted to hear other people’s opinions and stories…\n\nAfter I told her I use primarily Korean skin care, she said I need to switch to western ones. Why? Well because supposedly Korean skin care whilst good, is rather basic and good only if you get treatments often and then use it to maintain the skins health. BUT that western skin care is better for building up the quality and state of it, because it’s been around for much longer, and their clinical research has more backing. That’s as far as I know on that part, she’s of course not a skincare guru but rather an enthusiast (who’s cracked the code for her skin).\n\nSo two main important components she recommends is vitamin C in the morning (always concluded with spf), and retinol at night. Then two different kinds of moisturizers for morning and night. She swears by La Roche Posay Cicaplast B5 pro mask, she says it’s the only one she wears now.\n\nNow I was reeling after this conversation because I had the impression Korean skincare was better?! But apparently not? Depends on the products ofc and what type of skin you have (Japanese skincare for example is best suited for their type is skin type).\n\nWhat do you guys know about this comparison? Do you balance western vs eastern skincare in your own routines? I feel like I’ve had rose tinted glasses for Korean skincare. 🩵",

I have completely straight hair that gets oily the day after showering, this is the first time I've had it cut about an inch in length on the top. Shorter on the sides. I've never used hair products or styled it ever.\n\n- What products will help it lay flat?\n- I towel dried it after cutting, bad idea. If I leave it wet and put a hat or wrap or something on it, will it eventually lie flat?\n- Could a barber thin it or shape it or fade it into a more appealing shape? My friend tried to get it as even as possible, but they have zero training beyond shaving their own head.\n\nAssistance appreciated! Right now I'm debating on cutting it shorter, wearing a hat till it grows longer, or finding a barber that can figure out how to shape it better if that is even possible.",

      "content": "Hey guys just wanted to share the products that worked for me because I used this sub for a lot in my skincare journey. I’ve also attached before and after pictures\n\nAround June of this year I damaged my skin barrier and started breaking out like crazy to the point where 2-3 pimples would pop up every day even when I used only gentle face wash. I have acne prone skin but somehow managed it to keep it under control since 2022. But the damaged skin barrier triggered a lot of cystic and hormonal acne that I couldn’t control. After visiting multiple dermats and trying so many products this is the routine that finally helped me heal my acne and get rid of the scars.\n\nPrior to this I used to try products on my own. I used many products from the ordinary. Now I’m only using Indian pharmacy products that have honestly been my holy grail. I’ve gotten these products from my dermat but you can get them from any pharmacy without a prescription as well.\n\nThis is everything I’ve used and the procedures I’ve done to fix my skin:\n\nHealing skin barrier: \nAfter my skin barrier was damaged the first thing I was adviced to do was to stop using any products on my face. I did this for about 1.5 months until my skin stopped looking red and irritated. I only used face wash and moisturiser morning and night. \nGorgeous face cleansing gel- morning and night \nAcne moist cream- morning and night\n\nFixing acne and marks: \nAfter my barrier was repaired I first did a microdermabrasion session to get rid of clogged pores and extract existing whiteheads and blackheads. This was the routine I used afterwards: \nGorgeous face cleansing gel - morning and night\nAziderm 10% - keep it on for 2-3 hours in the morning and wash off \nGolite cream- every night for acne scars \nAcne moist cream- morning and night\n\nI have also done 3 rounds of microdermabrasion treatments with a month gap between each. MD really helped with unclogging pores and fading dark spots.\n\nHope this helps. I spent a lot of money and visited 3 dermats to finally figure it out. My skin isn’t perfect and I still have a few clogged pores and closed comedones but I’ve made a lot of progress! Hope this makes it easier for y’all!",

The day after using Azelaic acid I notice my skin peeling all over my face normally after applying sunscreen which then I have to remove as my face then looks a right mess. It only does this the day after Azelaic acid and not tretinoin, I have no problem with that. I only use water to clean my face in the morning, do I now need to gently remove this peeling skin in the morning then or cut back on the azeliac acid?. \n\nThank you. ",

      "content": "I’ve been double cleansing for about a month now and things were totally perfect at first. My blemishes cleared up nicely after just a week, I was honestly surprised. Then, randomly, about a week ago… things nosedived in the opposite direction! Before I’d have maybe one consistent, very annoying pimple. Within the last week, it felt like things reversed, and I was back to 4-5 at a time and all my dark spots jumped back in to say hello. I now have 14 of them on my face, and they popped up over a couple of days. I heard that you can have a delayed reaction to skincare products before, but I didn’t think they meant this delayed. Before when I used subpar products, I’d still only have about 4-5 pimples on my face at a time… NEVER over 10. What is going on?!\n\nI’ve tried problem solving as well. I do it night at around 8pm and I used to do a little longer than a minute with each step and really massage my face. However, I noticed my face getting oily when I woke up last week, so I figured I was doing it for too long and went to 30 seconds each step. My skin tends to be oil prone, so I figured this made sense. But it didn’t stop the breakouts… or the excess oil. I figured maybe it was the moisturizer then and used less before briefly switching, but my face still remains very oily when I wake up. I also tried using more of the water-based cleanser, still oily. I even tried washing it again after waking up, my face would be oily in a couple hours.\n\nAs I said, I’ve been using it for a month, and the first few weeks I did everything as before (cleansed for a little over a minute each step, used the same moisturizer, etc.) and was getting amazing results! My face had never been oily after waking up until the middle of last week. Why the sudden change? Could it be related to my hormones (period’s rushing in)? Do I have to give up the cleansing oil? The only constant in the equation seems to be the use of the oil. \n\nFor a little more context, my skin type is very oily and localized around my nose. It’s acne prone in the sense that I have literally never lived a day of my life without a pimple, but I don’t get a lot of them at one time. For a long time, when I was using other products, I used to dry it out because I thought that’s what normal skin was like. Maybe that’s affecting it? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾\n\nPS: (Took embarrassingly long to figure out how to get this to actually post, no comment 😭😭😭)",

I also feel like the longest layer is weighed down and doesn’t curl up as much as the rest?

(Like in these pics!)\n\nCurrently my routine includes: Neutrogena TSal shampoo (not my fav ever but guys im desperate), a random tea tree oil conditioner I got at aldi, and one of three leave in conditioner products (today for these pics was a mousse by not your mother’s curls, but I also have a Shea moisture foam and miss jessie’s multicultural curls cream in rotation). And I 99% of the time just air dry my hair\n\nMy hair is medium thick, pretty low porosity, and the area where I live has hard water &amp; high humidity, in case those factors impact any recommendations for products/routine.
