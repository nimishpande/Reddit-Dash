      "title": "1.5 Months on Tretinoin (0.025%): Smooth Sailing &amp; My \"No Purge\" Strategy for Beginners!",
      "content": "\n\nHie everyone, I just hit the 1.5 month mark using Tretinoin, and I am honestly still in shock. I started with 0.025% Tretinoin (Tretin 0.025) and, I have to knock on wood here, Seriously, no skin drying, no irritation, no burning, no awful purge. I think I might actually be God's favorite child, hahah!\n\nJokes apart, I've been on a long skincare journey. I've tried every active under the sun (kojic acid, glycolic acid, etc.), but nothing has given me this glassy, flawless, glowy, smooth skin like Tretinoin has. I seriously wish I'd started sooner.\n\nFor context, I have extremely oily skin and also deal with hyperhidrosis, but focusing on barrier health and diet seemed to be the winning combo.\n\nMy Winning Routine &amp; Key Factors\n\n• Amount: Use only a pea-sized amount for your whole face.\n\n * Application: I've been strictly using the sandwich method (moisturizer, Tret, moisturizer). \n\n* The Pressing Technique: DON’T rub it into your skin, PRESS it into your skin! I found that gently pressing the product in is WAY less irritating for me.\n\n * Moisturizer MVP: The Dot &amp; Key Barrier Repair Moisturiser has been an absolute game-changer. It's truly a godsend for barrier protection.\n\n* Eye Safety: Don’t get it in or too close to your eyes, as it can cause excessive eye dryness. I counter this by using gel drops before bed.\n\n * Internal Support: I've been focusing on a clean diet, packed with lots of fresh veggies and fruit, which definitely helps my skin from the inside out.\n\nI'll be continuing this routine consistently until mid-December to complete a full three-month run.\n\nA Word of Caution: Tretinoin Can Be Fickle!\nWhile my start has been great, I want to emphasize a serious point for everyone in the community. Tretinoin can be a very fickle product!\n\nThe possible downsides are often very dependent on a person's skin and are not necessarily universal. Tretinoin can cause skin sensitivity, redness, eye problems, perioral dermatitis, and lots of other things.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, 1.5 months is a very short amount of time. A lot of people don’t experience these issues until several months or even years into their Tret journey. That is to say, stay vigilant about keeping a healthy skin barrier and monitoring the condition of your skin closely. I love what Tret has done for me, but it demands respect!\n\nAdvice for Tretinoin Beginners: What I Learned: \n\nIf you're hesitant or scared about starting Tretinoin, here is the regimen and advice that worked for me:\n\nTLDR: My Top 3 Lessons\n\n * Start slow!! When I say slow, I mean SLOW, slower than you think you need to.\n * Simplify your routine and cut out all other actives. Let Tretinoin do the work.\n * Don’t overwash to keep your skin barrier intact and hydrated.\nUsage and Application Tips\n * Amount: Use only a pea-sized amount for your whole face. I dot it all over first, and then gently spread it in.\n * The Pressing Technique: DON’T rub it into your skin, PRESS it into your skin! I found that gently pressing the product in is WAY less irritating for me.\n * Eye Safety: Don’t get it in or too close to your eyes, as it can cause excessive eye dryness. I counter this by using gel drops before bed.\n\nGeneral Tretinoin Commandments\n\n * Waxing Warning: For gods sake, make sure to take a week off of it before waxing brows (or any facial hair). You will regret it otherwise!\n\n * Night Use Only: Tretinoin is very drying and irritating, so only use it at night.\n\n * SPF Mandatory: Wear SPF in the morning (and reapply!).\n\n * Moisturize: Give your skin a break whenever it needs it. Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!\n\n * Moisturizer Recommendations: If you need heavy-duty hydration, I recommend CeraVe. If you can get your hands on it, definitely try Vanicream—it’s excellent for sensitive and compromised barriers!\n\nConclusion\n\nFor me, the key was ramping up usage very slowly and keeping Tretinoin as the only active ingredient.\n\nHas anyone else had a smooth start like this that later changed? I'm curious to hear your long-term experiences! \n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I’ve never really dealt with acne before, so this is new for me. It kinda feels weird because I feel so insecure abt it especially the marks that just won't go away also I've already visited a dermat i spent like sm on skincare that she recommended but still ntg works \n\nAlso my skin is prone to cc and papular acne near my nose like close to my eye area but since I've started tret it's under control otherwise that was a headache,i have combination skin and like my T zone is prone to these bumps \n\nI’m already on tretinoin (since July) and using niacinamide + sunscreen daily, but these new pimples keep popping up and healing into dark spots. I’m guessing it might be hormonal, but not 100% sure.\n\nIf anyone’s gone through something similar what actually helped calm your breakouts and fade the marks? Products, ingredients, or routines that worked for you would be super appreciated ",

Even without the back of head cowlicks, it’s persistently frizzy and only holds strong curls on the day I wash it (sometimes I can revive them by spraying with water, but I think I’m allergic to something in the tap water where I live, so I’ve been avoiding that as it makes my scalp itch). I also feel like the longest layer is weighed down and doesn’t curl up as much as the rest? But I would really like my hair to look more put together, ideally camouflaging the awkwardly short bits as they grow out and reducing the overall frizz that seems to like the sides/back of my hair. (Should I cut it? Can I just put products on it? I don’t even know lol)\n\nIn other words, im tired of my hair looking messy when I’ve just washed it!!! (Like in these pics!)\n\nCurrently my routine includes: Neutrogena TSal shampoo (not my fav ever but guys im desperate), a random tea tree oil conditioner I got at aldi, and one of three leave in conditioner products (today for these pics was a mousse by not your mother’s curls, but I also have a Shea moisture foam and miss jessie’s multicultural curls cream in rotation). And I 99% of the time just air dry my hair\n\nMy hair is medium thick, pretty low porosity, and the area where I live has hard water &amp; high humidity, in case those factors impact any recommendations for products/routine. I want to keep the routine low maintenance (even diffusing to dry is a big ask for me on a regular basis lol) but would appreciate advice!!! I was never really taught how to properly care for curls, so it’s all been trial and error. thanks in advance!!",

I. Do. Not. Know. How. To. Take. Care. Of. It.\n\nI currently just use Native shampoo, sometimes I change between other brands but Native is the one I’m currently using. After I get out of the shower, about 80% of the time I let it air dry and not use any products. The other 20% of the time I use a Garnier Fructis cream but I don’t really like it because it gives me pimples on my head (sometimes right where the hairline begins). And I don’t wear anything special when I go to sleep.\n\n\nSo my questions for y’all are\n\n1) What’s my hair type?\n2) What haircut(s) should I get(fits me best)?/What hairstyle(s) could I rock?\n3) What should my whole hair routine be? Like what products and brands should I use (shampoo?, conditioner?, hair cream?) and should I air dry, use a diffuser?\n\nI really don’t know what to do but I wanna have beautiful hair!\n\nI’ll be more than happy to share a before/after after some time.\n\nThanks!",

      "title": "[B&amp;A]: Dr. Melaxin Peel Shot - First Impressions",
      "content": "My order with Dr. Melaxin Peel Shot arrived a week or two ago and by chance I decided to finally crack it open and give it a try. Against my insecurities, I’m being brave and posting my awful strawberry nose pics for the benefit of this community.  \n  \nBackground: my face, and especially nose area, has a lot of dead, flaky skin. From seborrheic eczema.  \nIt’s also really bad on my eyebrows, leading me to rub and itch my eyebrows and lose eyebrow hairs and in desperate times even flake skin into my eyes (yes, so gross).  \n\nSince teenage years, this, plus the oily conditions that probably doomed me to the eczema, has led to progressive damage on my nose skin and pore shape/cleanliness.  \n  \nMy normal exfoliation is entirely mechanical; rough surfaces or pastes that I scrub with. Usually not an actual scrub, but if it is, it would be sugar scrub.  \n  \nOver the years I’ve been unimpressed with anything I tried, and eventually more or less gave up on managing the actual pores and blackheads.  \n  \nI had tried Paula… Paula’s choice? Paula’s… niacinamide… years ago. **It could very well be that Paula’s niacinamide product helped a lot**, but I’m the type of person who gaslights myself about results if im comparing over longer periods, and not in the same day. And then, besides Paula, I felt like every tempting technique - those nose pore strips, comedone extractor (or, yes, I know, so heinous: trying to squeeze out your pores yourself). I know a dermatologist generally wouldn’t recommend any action for cosmetic benefit if there is ANY medical cost, but I find this status quo to be a bit… idk… cowardly? There is a material cost to cosmetic negligence! It affects confidence and, how people treat you! Subconsciously! So… Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. I just wish I had been taken seriously by a derm on my nose way before and not brushed off?  \n  \nOk, for the actual product experience.  \n  \nOBSERVATIONS:  \n- it seems to pill up immediately and readily on problem areas for my seborrheic dermatitis. That is, the areas with scaly gross skin.\n- likewise, areas heavy with sebum or sebaceous filament or blackheads pilled instantly too.\n- I’ve seen some people say “it doesn’t pill up on areas you already hit!” My assessment: mostly true, but it’s more about whether it already got all the material it wants to pill with. If you have heavy areas it might take multiple passes, but judging by the irritation/stinging afterward I imagine a derm wouldn’t recommend this.\n- I tried my other exfoliation use case - my lips. It did NOT want to pill on my lips and did so slowly if at all, leading me to think that the only pilling going on was mostly from whatever imprecision I had in targeting my lips and not the skin immediately around it, and/or the skin of my fingers having more to work with\n- I did a modest attempt to use it on hard-to-exfoliate areas for my eczema. That is, my eyebrows. Early results were promising, but having done a number already on my eyebrows today with illegal rubbing and itching prior to the product use, I’m going to give this a proper test another time when I’m not as likely to rip up hairs. The test was just a slow/gentle massaging of the product over my eyebrows, and it did pill up proportional to the agitation I provided. I’m excited to try this again later.  \n- I had to apply several times (probably not recommended by a derm) to keep the pilling density low and to keep the area operable. You can tell how “done” you are with an area by how much it pills. That is to say:  \n- relatively healthy, not dead or scaly skin, seems to be resilient to the pilling  \n- once an area was “done” (pilling much less), holy shit did my skin feel smooth and soft. I’ve never had such an instant softening like this.  \n- the actual contents of the pore/filament were being removed, and it seemed to be a mix of “layer by layer removal” and “the entire filament got removed (yay?)”  \n- even for the filaments that didn’t completely get removed, the outer layer is the worst, darkest, most visible part for most of them, so shedding a thin layer seemed to help appearance imo  \n- much like other aggressive pore clearing methods, I noticed the largest sebaceous filaments that did get removed completely left behind a familiar hole/pit/enlarged pore. Once my skin calmed down, maybe 20 minutes later, the pore/hole diminished in appearance and I think size/depth.  \n\nI’ve read some people saying stuff like “it’s the product pilling up not your skin” and “the pills from the product are what exfoliate”.  \nI find this to be very very hard to believe after using the product. It didn’t want to pill up on my lips, and it didn’t want to pill up on my upper arm or the back of my hand. It DID pill on my chest (I have a spot of seborrheic eczema there over the solar plexus, it pilled there and other areas. Perhaps a lot of dead skin in low contact zones?)  \n\nBy the fourth or fifth application to my nose (again I don’t think a derm would recommend this), it was  taking a lot longer to pill just a tiny bit, and led me to move areas a bit until I found a new spot that had pilling left.  \n  \nIf it’s the product pilling, why does it have such an instant success in smoothing? Why does it remove some entire sebaceous filaments so well? If it’s granule exfoliation, it wouldn’t be able to do that? If the product is pilling to itself, it shouldn’t need certain areas to do so?  \n  \nI also saw someone saying they rubbed it into their countertop and it pilled. I tried this too, and no pilling at all! Was there debris on their fingers that pilled maybe?  \n  \nThis product impressed me. I don’t believe in magic and I know my pores may happily and readily remake the sebaceous filaments, and I’m prepared for that disappointment. But holy shit this product gives:  \n- the instant gratification for smoothing and pore/sebaceous filament visibility reduction  \n- softness?? Genuinely!  \n- EASY. SIMPLE. FAST. As fast as you can apply and remove. What?  \n- precision in exfoliating scaly/dead/filament vs healthy barrier (and even hair).  \n  \nDon’t get me wrong, there’s still:  \n- the damn price  \n- irritation  \n- risk of damage from overuse (skin is burning but I also literally went at it like 5 times, against better judgement. I also am notorious for accepting pain for instant gratification and exfoliation purposes because I am just so disgusted and ashamed at how my skin looks on the left photos, genuinely) \n  \nMy verdict is that this is a total game changer for me, even the pessimist in me can’t argue that it wouldn’t be good before a professional headshot, presentation, etc.  \n  \n… anyway. Im here if people want me to answer questions about the experience or do a test with photos somehow. And if anyone has good aftercare suggestions with this product, as well as any other tips for my particular issues with seborrheic eczema and sebaceous filaments!\n  \n",

This goes up and down on frizz for a few reasons. If I need to deep condition and how much product I use. \n\nRoutine Process usually looks like: \n\nDeep condition shea moisture - 3-2 months. Whenever I feel like it or think it’s just too frizzy. \nShampoo same brand every 2-3 washes (3-5 days) \nStart putting gel in the shower with some water in my palm and shaking off excess water. \nWill finish after shower with more gel if needed just to make sure each curl is defined ( the longer I go with just moving my hair around it will get thicker - multiple curls locked together and also heavier causing curls to fall/stay extended) \n\nI love this product. BUT  it’s costly ($30) and also the problem is its delicate balance of how much I use. If I put to much my curls and continue to just move my hair around which curls it. It’ll be long and hard crunchy. Will look too stiff day 1-2 but day 3-6 it’s amazing. To little and I will have so much frizz and my curls will puff even more.\n\n\nHowever, my hair looks the best to me on day two or day three words it’s really nice and still has nice to find curls but it’s not so hard and crunchy, maybe in a few places, adding some depth and other places by curls are defined pretty loosely. \n\n\nI’m hopefully looking for something that can give me that same level of definition without the crunchiness if possible and also a cheaper price. I just wanted to test the waters and see if there’s any products out there. If not, I’m just gonna stick to what I have.\n\nThanks \n\n\n",

I am looking for some similar recommendations. I liked how it absorbed quickly, wasn’t greasy or sticky and wasn’t heavy.\n\nThe oils I have tried in the past are the The Ordinary Rosehip Oil and it broke me out SO bad. I think i’m sensitive to rosehip in general. High Expectations facial oil was expensive, hard to find and nothing special.\n\nThank you!",
