      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Even without the back of head cowlicks, it’s persistently frizzy and only holds strong curls on the day I wash it (sometimes I can revive them by spraying with water, but I think I’m allergic to something in the tap water where I live, so I’ve been avoiding that as it makes my scalp itch). I also feel like the longest layer is weighed down and doesn’t curl up as much as the rest? But I would really like my hair to look more put together, ideally camouflaging the awkwardly short bits as they grow out and reducing the overall frizz that seems to like the sides/back of my hair. (Should I cut it? Can I just put products on it? I don’t even know lol)\n\nIn other words, im tired of my hair looking messy when I’ve just washed it!!! (Like in these pics!)\n\nCurrently my routine includes: Neutrogena TSal shampoo (not my fav ever but guys im desperate), a random tea tree oil conditioner I got at aldi, and one of three leave in conditioner products (today for these pics was a mousse by not your mother’s curls, but I also have a Shea moisture foam and miss jessie’s multicultural curls cream in rotation). And I 99% of the time just air dry my hair\n\nMy hair is medium thick, pretty low porosity, and the area where I live has hard water &amp; high humidity, in case those factors impact any recommendations for products/routine. I want to keep the routine low maintenance (even diffusing to dry is a big ask for me on a regular basis lol) but would appreciate advice!!! I was never really taught how to properly care for curls, so it’s all been trial and error. thanks in advance!!",

However, I have gone days without picking and my skin was still red and very broken out. *\n\nI’ve had acne since elementary school (around age 12). It’s been 8+ years and it’s been really impacting my day to day life and hurting my mental health a lot. I am CURRENTLY trying to get a script for accutane but it’s a process (as I’m sure you all know). I’m also quite sensitive to medications and it’s expensive so we shall see.\nApologies for any spelling errors in the following part…\n\nthings I’ve tried:\n- topical treatments like differin gel and proactiv \n- niacinamide, salicylic 1&amp;2%, hyaluronic\n- tranaxemic acid (helped a little I think?)\n- birth control\n- going dairy-free (did nothing lol).\n- scrubs, anti-fungals, big hydrocolloid strips, pore strips, anything to physically get the oil out\n\nCurrent routine:\nAM: splash water on face, moisturize if need be. Makeup + spf if going outside. \n\nPM shower: double cleanse, oil based cleanser(Anua heartleaf) then water based(cerave or youth to the people). Around 2-3x per week I will use the innisfree volcanic pore cleansing foam in place of my water based cleanser to dissolve excess sebum then absorb it with a clay mask (1x/week). \n\nAfter shower: paulas choice lactic acid exfoliator (not every day) + moisturize (dieux lipid moisturizer). \n\nI know that sounds like a ton of products but I essentially cleanse, exfoliate, and moisturize. \n\nI know my picking doesn’t help, but I only pick when there’s actual things to pick at. \n\nAdvice needed! Recommendations? Is it just bad hormonal acne or something else? Will accutane actually do anything? Closed comedones or blackheads?😭 thank you guys in advance 🥺🧎‍♀️‍➡️\n",

I moisturize my face twice a day using Korean skincare (Aestura, Numbuzin, Aqua Squalene, etc.) and use Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion everyday all over my body after I shower in the morning. My friends always comment on how soft my skin feels.\n\nI am just wondering how she could immediately call out my dry skin. I don’t see any crust, or flakes or major dry patches and literally my skin feels so soft. Are there signs that I’m missing? I’m not necessarily glowing but maybe I’m used to one kind of look when “dry skin” comes to mind.\n\nMy dermatologist recommended La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ Balm. What else can I do to get hydrating skin from within? I drink a lot of water, I cook 90% of my meals and they are Asian forward with carbs, protein and veggies. Do I just lather myself in lotion every hour on the hour?",

Now it’s full blown around my chin and neck area. I have swollen lymph nodes and cracking skin now. Ive stopped putting any product on my face for a couple weeks now and I’m just using cold water to cleanse and air dry my face. I use ceraVe cream for moisturizer three times a day and mupirocin antibiotics for the open wounds.\n\nI’m 19 years old and I’ve always had random skin issues like acne since I was a pre-teen. Everyone else in my family has perfect skin so nobody knows what’s up with me. The acne is honesty the least of my concerns. I’ve tried everything for the past 8 years and even seen dermatologist. I’ve tried different diets, prescription drugs, no cleanser strategy. I’ve tried pretty much any product you can name. Thankfully right now my skin is relatively clear by previous standards so I can focus more on my dry skin. But when it breaks out randomly it is pretty bad. \n\nMy main problem is the raw skin. It really hurts and annoys me and I’m constantly flaking skin all over my iPad and tables which reallt gross people out. CeraVe is the only moisturizer that doesn’t burn like hell, but it doesnt really work well in stopping the spread of my disease.\n\nI thought that a possible cause was an allergy to something I was putting on my skin so I stopped cleansing with soap for a while and doing only water. This hasn’t done anything. Then I thought that maybe I am developing a gluten allergy so I am limiting my intake of that. Ive frequently been visiting the doctor and they told me that I just need to keep putting the moisturizer on my face and use the antibiotics when it gets cracked. They said I have normal eczema and/or fall seasonal allergies. But honestly I feel like he’s been pretty off and it isn’t getting any better.\n\nBut honestly I just really think it hurts and annoys me but it’s not too bad. It’s just that Ive been dealing with this for three months and it keeps getting worse. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI am looking for any and all hair care advice. My goals at this moment are hair growth, maintenance, and styling it to fit my profile.\n\nMy current routine looks like this (very low maintenance): \n\n1. I wash my hair roughly every two days (as my scalp tends to get oily, and my skin has a tendency to break out) with Dove daily moisture damage therapy Shampoo at the roots/scalp and body, and Dove daily moisture damage therapy Conditioner at the ends / lower half of the body of my hair.\n\n2. In my cabinet, I have Amika dream routine overnight hydration treatment, Amika blockade heat defense serum, Mizani 25 miracle milk leave in for all hair types, Shea Moisture Jamaican black castor oil strengthen and restore leave in conditioner, and Shea Moisture coconut and hibiscus curl enhancing smoothie. \n\nAll products of which I have experimented with and used infrequently or for various periods of time (the Amika was better for my hair when I was off at college and the water was harder due to it being less filtered, whereas at home I can use the shea moisture and it won’t weigh down my hair).\n\nI also have one of those water spray bottles that I have used on and off.\n\n3. I typically air dry my hair, brush it and go (wearing it straight but floofy). When I need to dress up, I will use heat to straighten it, but my hair doesn’t often take to maintaining this style- it will often wave/curl at the ends (especially if it is humid or at the slightest interaction with /exposure to water)\n\n4. I recently invested in a 100% silk pillowcase and bonnet due to my acne. Since then, I have noticed a huge positive change in the sense that my hair is way less frizzy. However, I find it so hard to get my hair in the bonnet, or to stay in the bonnet overnight. Any advice here would be welcome!\n\nI typically wear my hair down or half up. I most always wear it “straight”, which more often than not means floofy like seen in the pictures. \n\nI also have a slightly long nose, and natural cowlick in the front near my widow’s peak which I am very self conscious of and (in terms of the cowlick) don’t know how to hide / get rid of.\n\n\n*When it comes to the pictures, all but one are modern day. My hair has grown out now, but I included one picture from when I had bangs (which I had a love hate relationship with, but overall really liked them just didn’t know how to maintain them).*\n\n\nRight now I am thinking about growing out my hair, and cutting bangs again and/or getting a wolf cut. While my mother isn’t a fan of the bangs, it’s something that really boosted my confidence so there’s that haha.\n\nI appreciate everyone’s help!!\nThanks in advance to everyone who takes some time to help a girl get her hair game together :)",

Back then, my dermatologist recommended me isotretinoin and acne sol medication which worked wonders for me in the past. But it has stopped working for me this time. Fyi my dermatologist is in my hometown and currently I’m in a different and cannot go back for few months. Is there any way i can get rid of this? ",

I've never used hair products or styled it ever.\n\n- What products will help it lay flat?\n- I towel dried it after cutting, bad idea. If I leave it wet and put a hat or wrap or something on it, will it eventually lie flat?\n- Could a barber thin it or shape it or fade it into a more appealing shape? My friend tried to get it as even as possible, but they have zero training beyond shaving their own head.\n\nAssistance appreciated!

This happens even though I moisturize with Cetaphil face moisturizer after washing with cetaphil gentle face cleanser. So I only wash my face once in the afternoon. \n- At night and in the morning, I spray skinsmart antimicrobial facial cleanser on my face. I also spray my pillow and eye mask every night with it. \n- I used to use PanOxyl but couldn’t really tell much a difference so stopped.\n- I used to use tretinoin cream and it worked really well for a while and then randomly stopped working for me.\n\nI’m so tired of looking like I’m on meth with scabs and big red dots on my face all the time. They’re on my neck, chest, shoulders, and back too. I’m also unemployed after being laid off and I don’t think a face like this is helping me get another job. I also have OCD and obsessively pick at my skin which disrupts healing, but even when I am getting better with picking, pimples still appear.\n\nOther meds I’m on:\n- Adderall \n- Wellbutrin\n- Lexapro\n- Rx vitamin D\n- insulin\n\nAppreciate all help!!!",
