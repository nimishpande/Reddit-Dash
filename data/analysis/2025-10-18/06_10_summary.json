      "title": "skincare stuff i’ve learned from my dermant sister",
      "content": "1 - Stick to a routine. Doing CTM daily will give you better results than buying a 3,000 rs serum you use once a week.\n\n2 - If a product suits you, don’t switch just because some influencer said so. I’ve stuck to Clinique moisturiser for 5+ years and it still works.\n\n3 - What you eat shows up on your face. Avoid sugars and oils as much as you can.\n\n4 - CTM (Cleanse, tone, moisturise) is the best advice for most people. You don’t need 10 steps unless you're a professional whose career or work depends on having perfect skin. \n\n5 - Don’t fall for hype. everyone went crazy about that Dot &amp; Key Vitamin C serum and then forgot about it in 2 months? So stick to what has been working for others for years and not stuff that is trending.\n\n6 - Use sunscreen daily. SPF 30+ at least. The minimalist or Re’equil sunscreens are best.\n\n7 - Scrubs are not essential. and you should definitely not use them twice a week. Once every 8–10 days is enough unless you have blackhead-prone skin.\n\n8 - Buy for your skin type, depending on whether it is oily, dry, or a combo. Just because someone on Reddit said snail mucin is great doesn’t mean it’ll suit you.\n\n9 - Go for small sizes. Most people don’t even finish their products before they expire or oxidise which will do more harm than good (those damn vitamin C serums).\n\n10 - IMPORTANT: Don’t store skincare in the same bathroom as your regular shower. heat + steam is really bad for the shelf life of those products, if you must, keep them in a locked cabinet.\n\n11 - Mild cleanser &gt; harsh actives, unless you’re using something prescribed like AHA/BHA. Cetaphil and Simple are safe bets.\n\n12 - Drinking water is good, but it won’t clear your acne. That happens only with skincare + diet + hormones.\n\n13 - Don’t layer 6 products, the actives can clash. Stick to 3–4 max. Example: cleanser, serum, moisturiser, sunscreen.\n\n14 - New products take 3–6 weeks to show results.\n\n15 - Never sleep with makeup, not even tinted sunscreen. Just double clense and go to bed.\n\n16 - KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF YOUR FACE. Girl, you have no idea how dirt your phone is.\n\n17 - Sleep matters. Netflix binges will def show up on your skin.\n\n18 - DIY masks with lemon, toothpaste, or haldi ARE A BIG NO. Ayurvedic stuff is good but only in moderation, most natural chemicals are really bad for your skin because of how little you've been exposed to them.\n\n19 - Don’t blindly follow someone else’s routine. Make your own after experimentation and consultation from dermats.\n\n20 - Good skin isn’t flawless. it’s healthy, hydrated, and consistent. Stop chasing “glass skin” filters. That's marketing and especially for Indians, VERY HARD to achieve. Koreans can get that effect because of genetics and diet much more easily. Keep your peace girls, no need to obsess over something that's not right for you in the first place. \n\nHope this helped!!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

My hair seems to stick together throughout the day, I don’t brush it only in the shower and before styling with diffuser. My hair is wavy/curly long and a natural coarse texture. I have never had super soft hair, but it has been feeling a lot more dry over the past year or so so assuming that’s why it’s knotting. I did get a trim which didn’t help and I also have tried multiple deep conditioner treatments that never seem to provide enough hydration to prevent these knots from forming. Sometimes I can work through them and other times I end up having hair come out like pictured. Just want to spend less time on my hair and not loose anymore hair to knots. On top of loosing hair I damage my hair even more when I work through the knots as I try to separate the stands and end up snapping more hair. Any tips or suggestions product recommendations? I really don’t want to chop off all my hair so hoping I can find a solution without any major haircut. ",

(roughly 29 hrs ago) and the first pics are what i have rn, and the last pics are what i wanted. during the consultation, she said my hair was too short for the purple rods they’d normally use for a wavy perm and said she’d have to use gray rods and that over time the perm should loosen significantly. \n\nsome backstory, i did get it wet when i got home because i couldn’t stand the texture and she said the most it would do it loosen it some which is what i wanted. it was incredibly curly and i hated it. anyways, i went to bed (without a bonnet bc i haven’t found one that doesn’t give me a migraine) and it was frizzy and poofy and looked horrible so i wet it. idk how tf they expect you not to get it wet i would’ve went into work looking i got electrocuted if i hadn’t. my hair ended up getting frizzy and poofy through out my shift and it rlly started to bother me. i don’t know if this is just a curly haired thing, or if it’s the perm, but holy shit props to curly haired people. \n\ni got home from work and needed to take a shower. i googled it, and washing a perm isn’t recommended because it could ruin in and at this point i don’t even want it anymore. i feel like it’s way too curly, and the pictures are after i washed it and put in some curl defining leave in conditioner. it’s still way too curly. it looks alright wet, but then it springs up and becomes 10x more curly and i don’t like it. \n\ncan you guess how much more it’ll loosen? did i fuck it up by washing it or adding water? and by fucked up i mean will it stay this curly bc i don’t care if it falls out. the perm wasn’t super expensive and i hate the feeling of my hair when it’s dry now. \n\nanyways tips or advice is recommended 🫠",

      "content": "Hi, this is my first time posting and I read through many posts on a few different topics to try to get some of the info I’m looking for but hoping someone out there might have more specific advice on extremely irritated and sensitive skin reaction care.\n\nI’ve had pcos since I was in high school, my first and biggest clue was that not only did I have to shave off my mustache every morning but also coarse chin hairs too. It wasn’t too bad then but as I get older it has only gotten worse and it’s my biggest insecurity. I have to shave the second I wake up and midday the chin hairs are poking through my makeup. So if I don’t want to spend half of my day awkwardly covering the bottom half of my face sometimes I shave 1-3 more times - so that means my face is extremely irritated, sensitive, and filled with ingrown hairs each night. On days where I’m just staying at home and not seeing anyone I make sure to just keep my face clean and moisturized and don’t even look at acids or a razor. Right now from my chin down my neck and almost to my chest, the skin is raw and it looks like a rash almost but it’s just a bunch of ingrown hairs and skin that is really pissed off at me.\n\nRight now my most recent routine has been super simplified because I’m nervous to upset my skin even more. I use a gentle hydrating cleanser (the prequel gleanser + non drying salicylic acid cleanser) to wash before shaving, the medicube aha bha toner pads a couple times a week (sometimes just once or i skip it altogether if it’s gonna burn) and the byoma gel moisturizer. and honestly i usually slather on aquaphor too right before bed because at the end of the day my skin hurts. \n\nI know this seems like a pcos subreddit topic but I’ve been a part of it for years and I’ve scoured every post for someone who deals with this and knows how to handle the aftermath or has better preventative tips, which obviously they deal with this too but most of them seem to know how to shave daily without it being a big deal?? or just suggest laser hair removal which sounds great but not something in my budget right now. \n\ndoes anyone have any experience with perpetual broken, wounded skin filled with ingrown hairs that have found any routine or product to ease the pain and hassle??? i’m begging for relief ",

Although any brand I use has to be something that is actually quality.\n2. I use Redken Leave-In Deep Conditioner on my ends. I use many brands of mousse, sometimes Redken gel if I'm using my Denman brush. Sometimes I use oil on my ends, but I don't know the brand.\n3. I try to put products in, then put on a hair wrap for 15-30 min, then I'll usually let it air dry, because I don't have time to diffuse.\n4. I try to wear a bonnet to bed, but often forget. No satin or silk pillowcases because I don't like the way they feel.\n\nAlso, I don't have many good pictures of my hair, I'm sorry. But you can also see that towards my ends, I hardly have any hair. ):\n\nI have Irish curls, but most of it is a 3a curl pattern. My natural hair color is a medium auburn-tinged brown. Texture is dry, my hair follicles are thin, but I don't have thin hair in general. I'd say it's medium, but when I do wash my hair, SO much falls out. \n\nI have tried a million hair products, deep conditioners, serums, masks, prenatal vitamins, but my hair will not grow long. I was told that frequent trims help hair growth. All they did was cut the progress I made since the last appointment. I've seen multiple hairstylists hoping someone could give my hair the help it needs to grow. Not enough to think it's medical, but I just don't know where to turn. I've always wanted longer hair, especially with how pretty my curls would make it. Anyway, how much hair falling out every shower is considered normal??? lol Also, I feel like it's important to mention that I don't deal with a lot of split ends. Just my hair being dry. I did a porosity test with some of my hair, and the hair floated on the top, meaning low porosity. Does anyone have my same type of hair, and know products they LOVE?\n\nLong story short, I want long hair and healthy curls. Obviously, the curls won't get to perfection if I continue to get highlights, but I feel like my hair could still be SO much better and reach its full potential while still being blonde. I just don't know what to do. I would appreciate any and every advice I can get. Feel free to suggest any routines, products, hairdressers, etc.!!!! I'm located in North Fulton County in Georgia.\n\n  \nThank you so much!!!",

I’m going to a curly hair stylist tomorrow and I’m debating cutting a lot of hair off, like maybe a little below my shoulders.  I have no idea what I’m doing and I’m not entirely sure if my hair warrants a curly hair stylist, but I can’t figure out what to do with it.  Any thoughts?  Things I should ask or pay attention to with the stylist?  Would cutting it off help or harm my hair?  Should I shower tonight before I go?  If so, should I use products?  It doesn’t say on the website, but another stylist said come with day 1 hair?\n\nRoutine:\n\nProse shampoo and conditioner, use a wide toothed comb during conditioning and let it sit until the end of the shower, then rinse with cold water.  Curlsmith leave in conditioner, Prose curl cream, then scrunch out the water and plop in a microfiber towel for as long as I feel like and air dry. I sleep in a bonnet on a satin/silk (I honestly don’t know which one) pillowcase.  \n\n*I’m not a fan of the Prose products; I canceled my subscription and I’m just using it up at this point ",

      "title": "[Routine Help] I have two products with BHA, but serve different purposes. Can I use both in the same day?",
      "content": "Hello! I made a post a couple days ago asking about a new liquid exfoliant I got, which was the Naturium BHA Liquid Exfoliant 2%. Well, I happened to run out of my moisturizer today (Neutrogena Acne Moisturizer) and decided to switch to a new one, since it wasn't really helping the way I needed it to. I was recommended a new moisturizer, as well as the Cocokind Postbiotic Acne serum.  \nRight now I've only been using the Naturium every other night to get my skin adjusted, and I have to do the same for the Cocokind. I'm not too worried about the moisturizer, however I'm wondering if I'm able to use both the Naturium Liquid Exfoliant AND the Cocokind Acne Serum in one day? Both have BHA, however one is more focused on exfoliation while the other is to clear up acne. If I can't use both in one day, when should I use them? If it helps, I'm younger than 20 and these are the products I'm using currently/the theoretical schedule:\n\n\\- CeraVe Foaming Cleanser (aimed towards oily skin; twice daily)\n\n\\- Naturium Liquid Exfoliant (every other day, will switch to every night soon)\n\n\\- Cocokind Acne Serum (every other day, will switch to every day soon though not sure if I should do AM or PM) \n\n\\- Good Molecules Lightweight Moisturizer (every day, possibly twice daily) \n\n\\- SunBum Facial SPF (every morning)\n\n\\- Bubble Clay mask (twice a week, at nights; typically on these nights I wouldn't be using the liquid exfoliant, as recommended by some comments on my last post)\n\n(Note: I don't intend to switch out any of these products except the SunBum, just wondering when they should be used. If there's any affordable recommendations for SPF, I'd love to hear them! Right now I'm not loving the texture of the SunBum, hence why I'm considering switching.)\n\nBoth the Naturium and Cocokind are meant to eventually be used daily, but I also don't want to irritate my skin. Would it be possible to use the Cocokind in the mornings and Naturium at night? Extending my question of my last post, can I use the Cocokind on the same day as the clay mask? Or on those days should I just skip out on both the Cocokind and Naturium so I can use the clay mask at night? Any help is appreciated, and feel free to ask any clarification questions!",
