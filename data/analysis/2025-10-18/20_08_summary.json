      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

I then use OGX argan oil deep conditioning mask, followed by either Ever Pure or Redken All Soft conditioner.

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I took it out of my plop this morning after trying the “sleep with the cast” thing and I’m obsessed! I havnt scrunched out the cast yet, but most of my cast was scrunched out while I sleep. Kinda messy still but I love it anyway!\nMy routine: (Low porosity, Coarse Hair)\nWash upside down every other day with Aussie totally shampoo and conditioner. Scrunch to rinse both products. Once a week I use OGX rosemary and mint clarifying shampoo instead of Aussie. \nWhile still conditioning I detangle with a wide tooth comb before scrunching to rinse. \nApply products with dripping hair:\n-Argon Oil curl cream. Prayer hands with my head upside down, to one side (ear to shoulder), other side (also ear to shoulder). Scrunch in all three ways and then I do one more check\n-Olive Oil gel. Same process as above \nPlop with a dry t shirt for 30-45 minutes or until not dripping \nAir dry for at least 2 hours (my hair is thick as hell and takes at least 4 to dry but I’m too broke for a diffuser rn)\nReplop with a different DRY cotton t shirt and go to bed! \nWake up, take out the plop and let it dry whatever it needs to before scrunching out the cast. \nI bought some oil to scrunch out with to help it not feel so frizzy. I’ll let yall know how that goes! \n\n\n\n",

I started with clip ins that gave me bald spots then switched to a halo that has been my savior but it’s annoying seeing the wire and how they wiggle around on my head.

I've been considering doing an Arianna Grande style ponytail for cut 1, unicorn ponytail in middle of my hairline, and then another ponytail between the eyebrows for these cuts. I was also considering a ponytail at the nape of the neck to cut off damaged length. \n\nAppreciate any advice or tips, I'm using these methods due to disability and going to a salon is quite a painful process for me.",

So thought of creating a little experience and question repository here that might help everyone out. \nIf you have opted for LHR, I'd love to hear about your experience. \n\n1. Which clinic/ dermat did you opt for, which city? What type of lazer was used. What is your skin type (fair with dark hair/ darker complextion/etc)\n2. How many sessions did you sit for?\n3. How long as it been, and what are the results like? Completely bald/slow growth/ patchy/ still a yak🦬?\n4. How was the pain, compared to your pain tolerance.\n5. If you had your face (upper lips, chin etc) how was it? Was the pain bearable? Since hair here is generally finer, is it holding up or is it growing back?\n6. If you have gotten pregnant post LHR, is the pregnancy affecting the regrowth? \n7. If you have PCOS, is that affecting the results?\n8. Has anyone tried alternative laser treatments such as Urban company at home or IPL devices? How effective were there?\n9. Overall - HIT/ MISS? Should we splurge or keep going back to parlour didi?\n\nThese are just a few basic questions I had for anyone who's gone thru it. Please do elaborate on whatever you feel like and help a sister out ❣️",
