I didn’t curl each strand of hair individually, but I brushed parts of it upwards and shake that part out and then scrunch!! \n\nMy in-depth styling routine: \n1. I make sure my hair is completely wet (I didn’t wash my hair in the first pic bc I didn’t have time, so I just soaked it)\n2. I brush it fully out and take the upper part of my hair and put it in a bun on my head\n3. I use a styling creme from the curl company and spread it evenly throughout the mids and ends \n4. I scrunch my hair and after I did that I use curl jelly from umberto giannini and scrunch it again (use alot!! Not too much) \n5. I repeat this with the top part on my hair, but before i put anything in it i brush the top part all the way to the front of my face, then I separate pieces from the back to the front every piece I brush upward  and shake it out then scrunch (do this with all the pieces) \n6. When ur done go up side down w ur head and add more curl jelly and scrunch it upside down\n7. Plop!! I plopped my hair w a shirt for like 10 minutes, got dressed and did my makeup and then I carefully removed the shirt\n8. Diffuse!! Cold settings only, diffuse upside down and try to NOT TOUCH the hair!! Make sure you create a gel cast. After you fully blow dry grab some oil (i used the extraordinary oil from l’oreal paris) and scrunch out the curl cast and shake out the roots a bit and done!! \n\nMy hair has never looked this good and not frizzy!!! And the difference from the third pic is insane imo!!!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

He spends most of the day generally acting like an 18-month old boy. \n\nOur current routine:\nWash hair about once a week, sometimes with shampoo and sometimes with a co-wash. Comb out in bath with copious conditioner. Pat dry. Apply pureology leave in conditioner. Then add either Pillow Soft Curls or LA looks extreme sport gel. 1-2 times a week, brush out with water and lots of leave in conditioner which generally turns it into an Afro. \n\nMy son’s contribution to the routine: Add volume by rolling around on carpet daily. Redefine curls daily with sweat. Style with pasta sauce, melted cheese, or whatever is for dinner. Look adorable, encouraging friends and strangers to run their fingers through his hair effectively destroying any styling. \n\nIs there anything I can do to make his hair look a little less unkempt? I’m hesitant to cut it but is it better to go that route so it’s more manageable and detangles more easily? Could it help to just stop brushing it between washes?  \n\n",

I'm currently using Chemist at Play roll on for odour control and just saw it has 5% AHA. Other that that I've never used anything with such ingredients and have zero clue on what to do. \n\nCan people who've had similar issues help me out figure out a routine pls? Also, let me know if any of the following product is good enough:\n- Minimalist 8% Glycolic Acid Toner\n- Glyco 6 Cream\n- Be Bodywise AHA BHA Exfoliating Bodywash \n- Kojie San Soap \n\nI also read that Kunkumadi Tailam and Nalpamaradi tailam also helps in reducing tan.

I finally found sunscreen that works, but I'm looking for something to add to my routine that will help minimize some of the existing damage. \n\nI've tried an AHA, but not for long enough because I got frustrated that it was drying out my skin and I had a very hard time using a second BHA in combo with it (for routine reasons). I love my BHA that I use now, but it obviously isn't making the discoloration budge. I don't have significant dark spots, just noticeable discoloration on my forehead \n\n  \nI'm hoping to find a combo product that:   \n\\- works as an exfoliant   \n\\- also reduces sun damage   \n\\- Is under $100 (but ideally around $50) \n\nFor allergy reasons I can't use any products that contain:   \n\\- citric acid (any other acid is fine)   \n\\- dextrin   \n\\- cornstarch (highly doubt this will be in anything but just in case) \n\nIn addition to the allergies, I have eczema, so the dry skin issue is real and a nuisance. I moisturize, but if you have eczema, you know when I say it isn't always enough. \n\n  \nI have a very hard time keeping up with any extensive skin routine because I have a lot of other medical stuff that takes priority, so a combo product is really ideal here. I've looked into all the types of products that can help with sun damage, and I'd prefer to start on the lower end of intensity given my skin sensitivities (basically, holding off on retinoids if at all possible). \n\nAre there recommended combo AHA/BHA products out there? Or other products I can try before I try a retinoid?   \n",

I find I keep getting frustrated with my hair and can never make a decision. I slowly started bleaching my hair to let the gray blend in nicely, but now I'm not too sure how I feel about how it looks and how it will age my face. Should I go back to my medium ash brown and start covering my grays again, or let it go full gray? I feel like my hair is so damaged from all the dying. It's fine texture. The salon visits are expensive and id love to improve my hair health and not spend 300 a visit at the salon.\n\nAny advice would be helpful.",
