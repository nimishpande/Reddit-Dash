I’ve spent so long trying to maximize definition and force my now- bigger, looser curls into a perfectly defined coils with no frizz. I’ve finally accepted my curls are what they are and that while I can encourage their natural curl pattern to shine, I can’t force each curl to be tighter or smaller so I’d better just embrace what I’ve got! \n\n This is day 4 hair, and it tends to get flatter/ loose its bigness/ volume each day post wash day.. even with a bonnet. \n\nRoutine: \n I use OGX clarifying strength shampoo, super cheap from Amazon, innersense organics color radiance condition (their thicker conditioner is just a bit too heavy for my hair and weighs it down), miss Jesse‘s pillow, soft curls, and a bit of mop, top curly custard, but not too much\n\nThis past wash day, I air dried my hair, but it certainly gets bigger and more defined when I blow dry it with a diffuser… Just requires more work and I am a bit lazy ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "My hair has been getting worse and worse, and it makes me really depressed. I almost want to go back to straightening. The first pics are roughly a couple weeks after I stopped straightening. I have been using pretty much the same routine, save a change of shampoo here and there. Clarify with L'Oreal Ever Pure twice a week, if not clarifying, I use the Verb Ghost Shampoo (I cannot NOT shampoo at all, my hair looks like someone fried fish on the top of my head). I then use OGX argan oil deep conditioning mask, followed by either Ever Pure or Redken All Soft conditioner. Do not brush after that, put Fructis leave-in, OGX curl cream, and Fructis Pure Clean gel. Plop in a microfiber towel for 10-20 minutes, air dry, put a bit of Olaplex bonding oil. \n\nNot sure what my hair type is, definitely low porosity but not sure about thickness--always thought very coarse but have been questioning that lately. \n\nAny help would be really appreciated :(",

Kinda messy still but I love it anyway!\nMy routine: (Low porosity, Coarse Hair)\nWash upside down every other day with Aussie totally shampoo and conditioner. Scrunch to rinse both products. Once a week I use OGX rosemary and mint clarifying shampoo instead of Aussie. \nWhile still conditioning I detangle with a wide tooth comb before scrunching to rinse. \nApply products with dripping hair:\n-Argon Oil curl cream. Prayer hands with my head upside down, to one side (ear to shoulder), other side (also ear to shoulder). Scrunch in all three ways and then I do one more check\n-Olive Oil gel. Same process as above \nPlop with a dry t shirt for 30-45 minutes or until not dripping \nAir dry for at least 2 hours (my hair is thick as hell and takes at least 4 to dry but I’m too broke for a diffuser rn)\nReplop with a different DRY cotton t shirt and go to bed! \nWake up, take out the plop and let it dry whatever it needs to before scrunching out the cast. \nI bought some oil to scrunch out with to help it not feel so frizzy. I’ll let yall know how that goes! \n\n\n\n",

My skin does not respond to topicals too well and no matter what I do my acne always seems to come back (I’ve tried almost everything).\n\nI recently consulted a dermatologist and he prescribed me Benzoyl Peroxide 10% face wash, Tretinoin topical cream 0.025%, and Doxycycline hyclate 100mg twice a day. I am a bit worried about this because I did some research and saw that there are many side effects especially with the stomach, and I have a sensitive stomach. I also saw that it is not a permanent solution, and as soon as I get off the medication my acne will come back. The doctor has told me to use it for 3 months.\n\nShould I go with this? I just want to get rid of my acne and find a permanent solution, and I don’t know if this is it. I’m 18m btw.\n\n\nEDIT: should I ask for accutane instead of doxycycline?",
