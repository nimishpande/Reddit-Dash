      "title": "skincare stuff i’ve learned from my dermant sister",
      "content": "1 - Stick to a routine. Doing CTM daily will give you better results than buying a 3,000 rs serum you use once a week.\n\n2 - If a product suits you, don’t switch just because some influencer said so. I’ve stuck to Clinique moisturiser for 5+ years and it still works.\n\n3 - What you eat shows up on your face. Avoid sugars and oils as much as you can.\n\n4 - CTM (Cleanse, tone, moisturise) is the best advice for most people. You don’t need 10 steps unless you're a professional whose career or work depends on having perfect skin. \n\n5 - Don’t fall for hype. everyone went crazy about that Dot &amp; Key Vitamin C serum and then forgot about it in 2 months? So stick to what has been working for others for years and not stuff that is trending.\n\n6 - Use sunscreen daily. SPF 30+ at least. The minimalist or Re’equil sunscreens are best.\n\n7 - Scrubs are not essential. and you should definitely not use them twice a week. Once every 8–10 days is enough unless you have blackhead-prone skin.\n\n8 - Buy for your skin type, depending on whether it is oily, dry, or a combo. Just because someone on Reddit said snail mucin is great doesn’t mean it’ll suit you.\n\n9 - Go for small sizes. Most people don’t even finish their products before they expire or oxidise which will do more harm than good (those damn vitamin C serums).\n\n10 - IMPORTANT: Don’t store skincare in the same bathroom as your regular shower. heat + steam is really bad for the shelf life of those products, if you must, keep them in a locked cabinet.\n\n11 - Mild cleanser &gt; harsh actives, unless you’re using something prescribed like AHA/BHA. Cetaphil and Simple are safe bets.\n\n12 - Drinking water is good, but it won’t clear your acne. That happens only with skincare + diet + hormones.\n\n13 - Don’t layer 6 products, the actives can clash. Stick to 3–4 max. Example: cleanser, serum, moisturiser, sunscreen.\n\n14 - New products take 3–6 weeks to show results.\n\n15 - Never sleep with makeup, not even tinted sunscreen. Just double clense and go to bed.\n\n16 - KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF YOUR FACE. Girl, you have no idea how dirt your phone is.\n\n17 - Sleep matters. Netflix binges will def show up on your skin.\n\n18 - DIY masks with lemon, toothpaste, or haldi ARE A BIG NO. Ayurvedic stuff is good but only in moderation, most natural chemicals are really bad for your skin because of how little you've been exposed to them.\n\n19 - Don’t blindly follow someone else’s routine. Make your own after experimentation and consultation from dermats.\n\n20 - Good skin isn’t flawless. it’s healthy, hydrated, and consistent. Stop chasing “glass skin” filters. That's marketing and especially for Indians, VERY HARD to achieve. Koreans can get that effect because of genetics and diet much more easily. Keep your peace girls, no need to obsess over something that's not right for you in the first place. \n\nHope this helped!!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Hi, this is my first time posting and I read through many posts on a few different topics to try to get some of the info I’m looking for but hoping someone out there might have more specific advice on extremely irritated and sensitive skin reaction care.\n\nI’ve had pcos since I was in high school, my first and biggest clue was that not only did I have to shave off my mustache every morning but also coarse chin hairs too. It wasn’t too bad then but as I get older it has only gotten worse and it’s my biggest insecurity. I have to shave the second I wake up and midday the chin hairs are poking through my makeup. So if I don’t want to spend half of my day awkwardly covering the bottom half of my face sometimes I shave 1-3 more times - so that means my face is extremely irritated, sensitive, and filled with ingrown hairs each night. On days where I’m just staying at home and not seeing anyone I make sure to just keep my face clean and moisturized and don’t even look at acids or a razor. Right now from my chin down my neck and almost to my chest, the skin is raw and it looks like a rash almost but it’s just a bunch of ingrown hairs and skin that is really pissed off at me.\n\nRight now my most recent routine has been super simplified because I’m nervous to upset my skin even more. I use a gentle hydrating cleanser (the prequel gleanser + non drying salicylic acid cleanser) to wash before shaving, the medicube aha bha toner pads a couple times a week (sometimes just once or i skip it altogether if it’s gonna burn) and the byoma gel moisturizer. and honestly i usually slather on aquaphor too right before bed because at the end of the day my skin hurts. \n\nI know this seems like a pcos subreddit topic but I’ve been a part of it for years and I’ve scoured every post for someone who deals with this and knows how to handle the aftermath or has better preventative tips, which obviously they deal with this too but most of them seem to know how to shave daily without it being a big deal?? or just suggest laser hair removal which sounds great but not something in my budget right now. \n\ndoes anyone have any experience with perpetual broken, wounded skin filled with ingrown hairs that have found any routine or product to ease the pain and hassle??? i’m begging for relief ",

I also really really like my red that’s the other thing, as much as I want to try black again it feels hard leaving behind my red (especially because I get told it looks so nice on me) so gang let me hear it, is going black a good or bad idea?

I have no idea what I’m doing and I’m not entirely sure if my hair warrants a curly hair stylist, but I can’t figure out what to do with it.  Any thoughts?  Things I should ask or pay attention to with the stylist?  Would cutting it off help or harm my hair?  Should I shower tonight before I go?  If so, should I use products?  It doesn’t say on the website, but another stylist said come with day 1 hair?\n\nRoutine:\n\nProse shampoo and conditioner, use a wide toothed comb during conditioning and let it sit until the end of the shower, then rinse with cold water.  Curlsmith leave in conditioner, Prose curl cream, then scrunch out the water and plop in a microfiber towel for as long as I feel like and air dry. I sleep in a bonnet on a satin/silk (I honestly don’t know which one) pillowcase.  \n\n*I’m not a fan of the Prose products; I canceled my subscription and I’m just using it up at this point ",

Although any brand I use has to be something that is actually quality.\n2. I use Redken Leave-In Deep Conditioner on my ends. I use many brands of mousse, sometimes Redken gel if I'm using my Denman brush. Sometimes I use oil on my ends, but I don't know the brand.\n3. I try to put products in, then put on a hair wrap for 15-30 min, then I'll usually let it air dry, because I don't have time to diffuse.\n4. I try to wear a bonnet to bed, but often forget. No satin or silk pillowcases because I don't like the way they feel.\n\nAlso, I don't have many good pictures of my hair, I'm sorry. But you can also see that towards my ends, I hardly have any hair. ):\n\nI have Irish curls, but most of it is a 3a curl pattern. My natural hair color is a medium auburn-tinged brown. Texture is dry, my hair follicles are thin, but I don't have thin hair in general. I'd say it's medium, but when I do wash my hair, SO much falls out. \n\nI have tried a million hair products, deep conditioners, serums, masks, prenatal vitamins, but my hair will not grow long. I was told that frequent trims help hair growth. All they did was cut the progress I made since the last appointment. I've seen multiple hairstylists hoping someone could give my hair the help it needs to grow. Not enough to think it's medical, but I just don't know where to turn. I've always wanted longer hair, especially with how pretty my curls would make it. Anyway, how much hair falling out every shower is considered normal??? lol Also, I feel like it's important to mention that I don't deal with a lot of split ends. Just my hair being dry. I did a porosity test with some of my hair, and the hair floated on the top, meaning low porosity. Does anyone have my same type of hair, and know products they LOVE?\n\nLong story short, I want long hair and healthy curls. Obviously, the curls won't get to perfection if I continue to get highlights, but I feel like my hair could still be SO much better and reach its full potential while still being blonde. I just don't know what to do. I would appreciate any and every advice I can get. Feel free to suggest any routines, products, hairdressers, etc.!!!! I'm located in North Fulton County in Georgia.\n\n  \nThank you so much!!!",
