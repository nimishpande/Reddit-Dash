I didn’t curl each strand of hair individually, but I brushed parts of it upwards and shake that part out and then scrunch!! \n\nMy in-depth styling routine: \n1. I make sure my hair is completely wet (I didn’t wash my hair in the first pic bc I didn’t have time, so I just soaked it)\n2. I brush it fully out and take the upper part of my hair and put it in a bun on my head\n3. I use a styling creme from the curl company and spread it evenly throughout the mids and ends \n4. I scrunch my hair and after I did that I use curl jelly from umberto giannini and scrunch it again (use alot!! Not too much) \n5. I repeat this with the top part on my hair, but before i put anything in it i brush the top part all the way to the front of my face, then I separate pieces from the back to the front every piece I brush upward  and shake it out then scrunch (do this with all the pieces) \n6. When ur done go up side down w ur head and add more curl jelly and scrunch it upside down\n7. Plop!! I plopped my hair w a shirt for like 10 minutes, got dressed and did my makeup and then I carefully removed the shirt\n8. Diffuse!! Cold settings only, diffuse upside down and try to NOT TOUCH the hair!! Make sure you create a gel cast. After you fully blow dry grab some oil (i used the extraordinary oil from l’oreal paris) and scrunch out the curl cast and shake out the roots a bit and done!! \n\nMy hair has never looked this good and not frizzy!!! And the difference from the third pic is insane imo!!!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

He spends most of the day generally acting like an 18-month old boy. \n\nOur current routine:\nWash hair about once a week, sometimes with shampoo and sometimes with a co-wash. Comb out in bath with copious conditioner. Pat dry. Apply pureology leave in conditioner. Then add either Pillow Soft Curls or LA looks extreme sport gel. 1-2 times a week, brush out with water and lots of leave in conditioner which generally turns it into an Afro. \n\nMy son’s contribution to the routine: Add volume by rolling around on carpet daily. Redefine curls daily with sweat. Style with pasta sauce, melted cheese, or whatever is for dinner. Look adorable, encouraging friends and strangers to run their fingers through his hair effectively destroying any styling. \n\nIs there anything I can do to make his hair look a little less unkempt? I’m hesitant to cut it but is it better to go that route so it’s more manageable and detangles more easily? Could it help to just stop brushing it between washes?  \n\n",

Second pic is my hair after 3 days. \n\nI’ve had this problem since years so I finally wanna ask here, did someone have the same struggle and fixed it? Or any ideas? \n\nPeople have even asked me if I got a haircut, but it’s just my curls „contracting“ the longer I don’t wash. I usually wash every 5 days, they only look good on day 3-5. \n\nI’ve changed products often, especially the leave in products, tried adding or leaving things away, it’s still exactly the same. I make sure to only use silikone and sulfate free products usually as well. So I don’t even know what issue my hair has. \nIt also doesn’t matter if my hair is dyed or not, if it’s shorter or a bit longer or if I dry by air or use a blow dryer. \n\nUsually: I use shampoo twice, conditioner, out of the shower leave in conditioner and a little bit of gel. Basic routine. \n\nI love my hair but also it’s lowkey driving me insane. ",

Adam Milk Toner\nNip + Fab Vitamin C Gel Cream or LRP Cicaplast\nBeauty of Joseon Sunscreen SPF 50+\n\nPM:\n\nSkin 1004 Centella Oil Cleanser\nCentella Foam Cleanser or Jean &amp; Lean Gel Cleanser or COSRX Low pH Cleanser\nTorriden Dive In Serum\nSkin 1004 Tone Brightening Serum\nNip + Fab Ceramide Serum\nLRP Cicaplast\nOn active nights (1–2 times a week):\nAfter double cleansing, I’ll use Retinol, Tretinoin, or Biologique Recherche P50, followed by a Ceramide Serum and Cicaplast.\n\nMy main struggle is that my skin barrier feels weak — it doesn’t tolerate actives very well, and that makes it hard to make progress.\n\nAny advice or product recommendations would mean so much. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to help",

I finally found sunscreen that works, but I'm looking for something to add to my routine that will help minimize some of the existing damage. \n\nI've tried an AHA, but not for long enough because I got frustrated that it was drying out my skin and I had a very hard time using a second BHA in combo with it (for routine reasons). I love my BHA that I use now, but it obviously isn't making the discoloration budge. I don't have significant dark spots, just noticeable discoloration on my forehead \n\n  \nI'm hoping to find a combo product that:   \n\\- works as an exfoliant   \n\\- also reduces sun damage   \n\\- Is under $100 (but ideally around $50) \n\nFor allergy reasons I can't use any products that contain:   \n\\- citric acid (any other acid is fine)   \n\\- dextrin   \n\\- cornstarch (highly doubt this will be in anything but just in case) \n\nIn addition to the allergies, I have eczema, so the dry skin issue is real and a nuisance. I moisturize, but if you have eczema, you know when I say it isn't always enough. \n\n  \nI have a very hard time keeping up with any extensive skin routine because I have a lot of other medical stuff that takes priority, so a combo product is really ideal here. I've looked into all the types of products that can help with sun damage, and I'd prefer to start on the lower end of intensity given my skin sensitivities (basically, holding off on retinoids if at all possible). \n\nAre there recommended combo AHA/BHA products out there? Or other products I can try before I try a retinoid?   \n",

My face is a shade btw both and tbh I don't mind that at all.\n\nBut i wanna try and reduce the tan on my arms and also the hyperpigmentation on my knees.\n\nI went through a few posts and saw many recommending Glycolic acid and AHA BHA anol for this. I'm currently using Chemist at Play roll on for odour control and just saw it has 5% AHA. Other that that I've never used anything with such ingredients and have zero clue on what to do. \n\nCan people who've had similar issues help me out figure out a routine pls? Also, let me know if any of the following product is good enough:\n- Minimalist 8% Glycolic Acid Toner\n- Glyco 6 Cream\n- Be Bodywise AHA BHA Exfoliating Bodywash \n- Kojie San Soap \n\nI also read that Kunkumadi Tailam and Nalpamaradi tailam also helps in reducing tan. Is it really effective?\n\nI have a normal skin type- it gets dry during winter but stays fine in summer. ",

Once a week I use OGX rosemary and mint clarifying shampoo instead of Aussie. \nWhile still conditioning I detangle with a wide tooth comb before scrunching to rinse. \nApply products with dripping hair:\n-Argon Oil curl cream. Prayer hands with my head upside down, to one side (ear to shoulder), other side (also ear to shoulder). Scrunch in all three ways and then I do one more check\n-Olive Oil gel. Same process as above \nPlop with a dry t shirt for 30-45 minutes or until not dripping \nAir dry for at least 2 hours (my hair is thick as hell and takes at least 4 to dry but I’m too broke for a diffuser rn)\nReplop with a different DRY cotton t shirt and go to bed! \nWake up, take out the plop and let it dry whatever it needs to before scrunching out the cast. \nI bought some oil to scrunch out with to help it not feel so frizzy.

So thought of creating a little experience and question repository here that might help everyone out. \nIf you have opted for LHR, I'd love to hear about your experience. \n\n1. Which clinic/ dermat did you opt for, which city? What type of lazer was used. What is your skin type (fair with dark hair/ darker complextion/etc)\n2. How many sessions did you sit for?\n3. How long as it been, and what are the results like? Completely bald/slow growth/ patchy/ still a yak🦬?\n4. How was the pain, compared to your pain tolerance.\n5. If you had your face (upper lips, chin etc) how was it? Was the pain bearable? Since hair here is generally finer, is it holding up or is it growing back?\n6. If you have gotten pregnant post LHR, is the pregnancy affecting the regrowth? \n7. If you have PCOS, is that affecting the results?\n8. Has anyone tried alternative laser treatments such as Urban company at home or IPL devices? How effective were there?\n9. Overall - HIT/ MISS? Should we splurge or keep going back to parlour didi?\n\nThese are just a few basic questions I had for anyone who's gone thru it. Please do elaborate on whatever you feel like and help a sister out ❣️",

I have no idea what I’m doing and I’m not entirely sure if my hair warrants a curly hair stylist, but I can’t figure out what to do with it.  Any thoughts?  Things I should ask or pay attention to with the stylist?  Would cutting it off help or harm my hair?  Should I shower tonight before I go?  If so, should I use products?  It doesn’t say on the website, but another stylist said come with day 1 hair?\n\nRoutine:\n\nProse shampoo and conditioner, use a wide toothed comb during conditioning and let it sit until the end of the shower, then rinse with cold water.  Curlsmith leave in conditioner, Prose curl cream, then scrunch out the water and plop in a microfiber towel for as long as I feel like and air dry. I sleep in a bonnet on a satin/silk (I honestly don’t know which one) pillowcase.  \n\n*I’m not a fan of the Prose products; I canceled my subscription and I’m just using it up at this point ",

For the last few months the amount of hair I shed on my brush and my clothes seems absurd to me. I can’t tell if it’s a normal healthy amount or not. It’s tough to figure out by googling and I’m not close to any girls with hair like mine to talk to.    \n    \nMy routine: I do very little with my hair. I mostly wear it down and loose, just put it in a man bun to eat or when it’s windy or something. I wash it once or twice a week. I use shampoo (amarás) then gently wring out my hair a bit then put in conditioner (also amarás) and leave it in while i wash my body and whatever. Then I brush with a tangle teezer original detangling brush and rinse the conditioner out. For the rest of my showers I just rinse with water and conditioner. The brushing is never difficult and usually only takes a minute or two but i pull out what seems like a TON of hairs on the brush. I don’t use any leave-in product.    \n    \nMy hair: Blond and curly. Fine individual hairs but a lot of them. See attached. It never feels like there’s anything wrong with it and people say it looks healthy. Just worried about the shedding.    \n    \nI’d really just like advice on how to tell if i’m doing something wrong and how to find what to do instead. Thank you :)     \n    \nSome pics in various lightings and days-since-washing https://imgur.com/a/47U9jbA",
