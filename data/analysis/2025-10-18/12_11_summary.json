I didn’t curl each strand of hair individually, but I brushed parts of it upwards and shake that part out and then scrunch!! \n\nMy in-depth styling routine: \n1. I make sure my hair is completely wet (I didn’t wash my hair in the first pic bc I didn’t have time, so I just soaked it)\n2. I brush it fully out and take the upper part of my hair and put it in a bun on my head\n3. I use a styling creme from the curl company and spread it evenly throughout the mids and ends \n4. I scrunch my hair and after I did that I use curl jelly from umberto giannini and scrunch it again (use alot!! Not too much) \n5. I repeat this with the top part on my hair, but before i put anything in it i brush the top part all the way to the front of my face, then I separate pieces from the back to the front every piece I brush upward  and shake it out then scrunch (do this with all the pieces) \n6. When ur done go up side down w ur head and add more curl jelly and scrunch it upside down\n7. Plop!! I plopped my hair w a shirt for like 10 minutes, got dressed and did my makeup and then I carefully removed the shirt\n8. Diffuse!! Cold settings only, diffuse upside down and try to NOT TOUCH the hair!! Make sure you create a gel cast. After you fully blow dry grab some oil (i used the extraordinary oil from l’oreal paris) and scrunch out the curl cast and shake out the roots a bit and done!! \n\nMy hair has never looked this good and not frizzy!!!

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Hi, this is my first time posting and I read through many posts on a few different topics to try to get some of the info I’m looking for but hoping someone out there might have more specific advice on extremely irritated and sensitive skin reaction care.\n\nI’ve had pcos since I was in high school, my first and biggest clue was that not only did I have to shave off my mustache every morning but also coarse chin hairs too. It wasn’t too bad then but as I get older it has only gotten worse and it’s my biggest insecurity. I have to shave the second I wake up and midday the chin hairs are poking through my makeup. So if I don’t want to spend half of my day awkwardly covering the bottom half of my face sometimes I shave 1-3 more times - so that means my face is extremely irritated, sensitive, and filled with ingrown hairs each night. On days where I’m just staying at home and not seeing anyone I make sure to just keep my face clean and moisturized and don’t even look at acids or a razor. Right now from my chin down my neck and almost to my chest, the skin is raw and it looks like a rash almost but it’s just a bunch of ingrown hairs and skin that is really pissed off at me.\n\nRight now my most recent routine has been super simplified because I’m nervous to upset my skin even more. I use a gentle hydrating cleanser (the prequel gleanser + non drying salicylic acid cleanser) to wash before shaving, the medicube aha bha toner pads a couple times a week (sometimes just once or i skip it altogether if it’s gonna burn) and the byoma gel moisturizer. and honestly i usually slather on aquaphor too right before bed because at the end of the day my skin hurts. \n\nI know this seems like a pcos subreddit topic but I’ve been a part of it for years and I’ve scoured every post for someone who deals with this and knows how to handle the aftermath or has better preventative tips, which obviously they deal with this too but most of them seem to know how to shave daily without it being a big deal?? or just suggest laser hair removal which sounds great but not something in my budget right now. \n\ndoes anyone have any experience with perpetual broken, wounded skin filled with ingrown hairs that have found any routine or product to ease the pain and hassle??? i’m begging for relief ",
