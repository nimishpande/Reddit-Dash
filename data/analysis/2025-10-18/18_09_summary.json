Comb out in bath with copious conditioner. Pat dry. Apply pureology leave in conditioner. Then add either Pillow Soft Curls or LA looks extreme sport gel. 1-2 times a week, brush out with water and lots of leave in conditioner which generally turns it into an Afro. \n\nMy son’s contribution to the routine: Add volume by rolling around on carpet daily. Redefine curls daily with sweat. Style with pasta sauce, melted cheese, or whatever is for dinner. Look adorable, encouraging friends and strangers to run their fingers through his hair effectively destroying any styling. \n\nIs there anything I can do to make his hair look a little less unkempt? I’m hesitant to cut it but is it better to go that route so it’s more manageable and detangles more easily? Could it help to just stop brushing it between washes?  \n\n",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Second pic is my hair after 3 days. \n\nI’ve had this problem since years so I finally wanna ask here, did someone have the same struggle and fixed it? Or any ideas? \n\nPeople have even asked me if I got a haircut, but it’s just my curls „contracting“ the longer I don’t wash. I usually wash every 5 days, they only look good on day 3-5. \n\nI’ve changed products often, especially the leave in products, tried adding or leaving things away, it’s still exactly the same. I make sure to only use silikone and sulfate free products usually as well. So I don’t even know what issue my hair has. \nIt also doesn’t matter if my hair is dyed or not, if it’s shorter or a bit longer or if I dry by air or use a blow dryer. \n\nUsually: I use shampoo twice, conditioner, out of the shower leave in conditioner and a little bit of gel. Basic routine. \n\nI love my hair but also it’s lowkey driving me insane. ",

The first pics are roughly a couple weeks after I stopped straightening. I have been using pretty much the same routine, save a change of shampoo here and there. Clarify with L'Oreal Ever Pure twice a week, if not clarifying, I use the Verb Ghost Shampoo (I cannot NOT shampoo at all, my hair looks like someone fried fish on the top of my head). I then use OGX argan oil deep conditioning mask, followed by either Ever Pure or Redken All Soft conditioner. Do not brush after that, put Fructis leave-in, OGX curl cream, and Fructis Pure Clean gel. Plop in a microfiber towel for 10-20 minutes, air dry, put a bit of Olaplex bonding oil. \n\nNot sure what my hair type is, definitely low porosity but not sure about thickness--always thought very coarse but have been questioning that lately. \n\nAny help would be really appreciated :(",

So please don’t judge.\n\nI did 5 sessions of IPL to improve my skin tone and help with rosacea. It helped but the diffused pinkness stayed in areas like above eyebrows, cheeks, etc. Previously I had badly damaged skin barrier I think is now repaired (but correct me if I’m wrong). I am using gentle  products from cerave and Paula’s choice of acne skin and sometimes elidel for my eczema on my forehead and hylaricic acid and salicylic acid.\n\nAt this point I’m not sure what should be my next step. I’m bothered by my pores, skin tone,  and texture, skin texture, and how oily it gets. What should I focus on next? I am going to do microneedling for texture and Botox for forehead wrinkles soon but I’m not sure what should I change or improve or focus on to look better. Can you please judge what’s the first thing that needs to be addressed and advice what to do?",

So thought of creating a little experience and question repository here that might help everyone out. \nIf you have opted for LHR, I'd love to hear about your experience. \n\n1. Which clinic/ dermat did you opt for, which city? What type of lazer was used. What is your skin type (fair with dark hair/ darker complextion/etc)\n2. How many sessions did you sit for?\n3. How long as it been, and what are the results like? Completely bald/slow growth/ patchy/ still a yak🦬?\n4. How was the pain, compared to your pain tolerance.\n5. If you had your face (upper lips, chin etc) how was it? Was the pain bearable? Since hair here is generally finer, is it holding up or is it growing back?\n6. If you have gotten pregnant post LHR, is the pregnancy affecting the regrowth? \n7. If you have PCOS, is that affecting the results?\n8. Has anyone tried alternative laser treatments such as Urban company at home or IPL devices? How effective were there?\n9. Overall - HIT/ MISS? Should we splurge or keep going back to parlour didi?\n\nThese are just a few basic questions I had for anyone who's gone thru it. Please do elaborate on whatever you feel like and help a sister out ❣️",

Kinda messy still but I love it anyway!\nMy routine: (Low porosity, Coarse Hair)\nWash upside down every other day with Aussie totally shampoo and conditioner. Scrunch to rinse both products. Once a week I use OGX rosemary and mint clarifying shampoo instead of Aussie. \nWhile still conditioning I detangle with a wide tooth comb before scrunching to rinse. \nApply products with dripping hair:\n-Argon Oil curl cream. Prayer hands with my head upside down, to one side (ear to shoulder), other side (also ear to shoulder). Scrunch in all three ways and then I do one more check\n-Olive Oil gel. Same process as above \nPlop with a dry t shirt for 30-45 minutes or until not dripping \nAir dry for at least 2 hours (my hair is thick as hell and takes at least 4 to dry but I’m too broke for a diffuser rn)\nReplop with a different DRY cotton t shirt and go to bed! \nWake up, take out the plop and let it dry whatever it needs to before scrunching out the cast. \nI bought some oil to scrunch out with to help it not feel so frizzy. I’ll let yall know how that goes! \n\n\n\n",

Next day bumps started to form and soon after my lips were filled with tons of tiny bumps. This healed within a week or two with persistent application of CeraVe healing ointment and Vaseline. After that the corners of my lips became really dry and cracking. I kept them moisturized and that soon stopped. Now I’ve been left with two big discolored spots on both sides of my mouth. They looked identical to the same spots that can come and go on my face when dry/dehydrated. However these have been there for some months now. Just a week ago the middle of my lip have been dry and red. Any suggestions on what this is and if I should see a dermatologist or esthetician? Any suggestions on what routine I should be using to help with discoloration and my skin in general ? \n\nSo far I have been consistently applying CeraVe healing ointment, Vaseline and Aquaphor lip stuff that has spf in it. None of these seem to be helping with the disappearance of these eye sores. 😩",

      "content": "TLDR: long wavy hair, color/bleach processed, wash and use heat once a week. i’m extremely lazy but like looking somewhat put together. which of these options gives me the most “bang for my buck”?\n\n\ni can’t choose between the two! im debating between sticking to a blowout style consistently or diffusing consistently. i’m extremely lazy and low energy but i prioritize my hair being voluminous and decently put together.\n\na little about my hair: it’s wavy 2a/2b, partially color treated and bleached(my roots are super grown in by now but the bottom half is bleached), i’d say medium porosity overall with a decent amount of frizz naturally. the strands are fine but overall dense as in i have a lot of hair and it’s long. it gets tangled very easily. since its textured and generally dry, i only wash and use heat on it once a week. \n\nwhen i diffuse it i use heat protectant, hover over my hair on high heat/high power and then eventually lower the heat and drying power when im “scrunching” at my waves, this is the only time the dryer touches my scalp. at the end i give my hair a blast of cold air. between wash days after using the diffuser, i do very simple heatless curls/twists and refresh my \nhair with a little bit of water+gel frequently. \n\npros/cons to this: my waves are never consistent after wash days and getting them to look decently wavy is a chore that requires a little bit of water to refresh and scrunching. heatless curls are a little easier to maintain since i use a misting of water to dampen styles and lock them in overnight. i love the freedom of not being afraid of water! however, i hate not being able to brush my hair without it looking poofy. usually looks less put together, but volume is easier to maintain. frizz is much more obvious.\n\nwhen im doing a blowout i still use heat protectant, use the revlon volumizer hair dryer/hot air brush to give a blowout effect(also high heat), and then eventually give a blast of cold air at the end. \nbetween wash days, i sometimes also do simple heatless curls overnight but on dry hair. at most i’ll wet my bangs only since they require a bit of constant styling. \n\npros/cons to this: hair is much more consistent and easy to maintain. i can actually brush it while it’s relatively straight! i hate the fear of getting water on my hair because it disrupts the smoothness/straightness of the blowout. frizz is not an issue. tangled goes down/is way more manageable. volume becomes a little bit more flat throughout the week but i can supplement it using hair products.\n\neither way, i’m trying to get as much volume as humanly possible and i’m using the same amount of products. also, which of these styling techniques is more prone to damaging hair in the long run? that will also help me decide. if you got to the end of this, i seriously applaud you!\n\n",
