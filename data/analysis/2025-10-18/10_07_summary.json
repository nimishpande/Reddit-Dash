      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Hi, this is my first time posting and I read through many posts on a few different topics to try to get some of the info I’m looking for but hoping someone out there might have more specific advice on extremely irritated and sensitive skin reaction care.\n\nI’ve had pcos since I was in high school, my first and biggest clue was that not only did I have to shave off my mustache every morning but also coarse chin hairs too. It wasn’t too bad then but as I get older it has only gotten worse and it’s my biggest insecurity. I have to shave the second I wake up and midday the chin hairs are poking through my makeup. So if I don’t want to spend half of my day awkwardly covering the bottom half of my face sometimes I shave 1-3 more times - so that means my face is extremely irritated, sensitive, and filled with ingrown hairs each night. On days where I’m just staying at home and not seeing anyone I make sure to just keep my face clean and moisturized and don’t even look at acids or a razor. Right now from my chin down my neck and almost to my chest, the skin is raw and it looks like a rash almost but it’s just a bunch of ingrown hairs and skin that is really pissed off at me.\n\nRight now my most recent routine has been super simplified because I’m nervous to upset my skin even more. I use a gentle hydrating cleanser (the prequel gleanser + non drying salicylic acid cleanser) to wash before shaving, the medicube aha bha toner pads a couple times a week (sometimes just once or i skip it altogether if it’s gonna burn) and the byoma gel moisturizer. and honestly i usually slather on aquaphor too right before bed because at the end of the day my skin hurts. \n\nI know this seems like a pcos subreddit topic but I’ve been a part of it for years and I’ve scoured every post for someone who deals with this and knows how to handle the aftermath or has better preventative tips, which obviously they deal with this too but most of them seem to know how to shave daily without it being a big deal?? or just suggest laser hair removal which sounds great but not something in my budget right now. \n\ndoes anyone have any experience with perpetual broken, wounded skin filled with ingrown hairs that have found any routine or product to ease the pain and hassle??? i’m begging for relief ",

My face is a shade btw both and tbh I don't mind that at all.\n\nBut i wanna try and reduce the tan on my arms and also the hyperpigmentation on my knees.\n\nI went through a few posts and saw many recommending Glycolic acid and AHA BHA anol for this. I'm currently using Chemist at Play roll on for odour control and just saw it has 5% AHA. Other that that I've never used anything with such ingredients and have zero clue on what to do. \n\nCan people who've had similar issues help me out figure out a routine pls? Also, let me know if any of the following product is good enough:\n- Minimalist 8% Glycolic Acid Toner\n- Glyco 6 Cream\n- Be Bodywise AHA BHA Exfoliating Bodywash \n- Kojie San Soap \n\nI also read that Kunkumadi Tailam and Nalpamaradi tailam also helps in reducing tan. Is it really effective?\n\nI have a normal skin type- it gets dry during winter but stays fine in summer. ",

I also really really like my red that’s the other thing, as much as I want to try black again it feels hard leaving behind my red (especially because I get told it looks so nice on me) so gang let me hear it, is going black a good or bad idea?

As far as I understand, silicone somewhat smooths/seals the cuticle and forms a protective layer which would make it harder for other things to penetrate to the hair.\nSo is there any benefit (esp hair health benefit) on applying a non-silicone containing hair oil after a silicone containing leave-in and styler?",

      "content": "1. I use Amika Hydro Rush Intense shampoo and conditioner, but travel a lot, so I can't take my big bottles, so honestly, I use many different brands. Although any brand I use has to be something that is actually quality.\n2. I use Redken Leave-In Deep Conditioner on my ends. I use many brands of mousse, sometimes Redken gel if I'm using my Denman brush. Sometimes I use oil on my ends, but I don't know the brand.\n3. I try to put products in, then put on a hair wrap for 15-30 min, then I'll usually let it air dry, because I don't have time to diffuse.\n4. I try to wear a bonnet to bed, but often forget. No satin or silk pillowcases because I don't like the way they feel.\n\nAlso, I don't have many good pictures of my hair, I'm sorry. But you can also see that towards my ends, I hardly have any hair. ):\n\nI have Irish curls, but most of it is a 3a curl pattern. My natural hair color is a medium auburn-tinged brown. Texture is dry, my hair follicles are thin, but I don't have thin hair in general. I'd say it's medium, but when I do wash my hair, SO much falls out. \n\nI have tried a million hair products, deep conditioners, serums, masks, prenatal vitamins, but my hair will not grow long. I was told that frequent trims help hair growth. All they did was cut the progress I made since the last appointment. I've seen multiple hairstylists hoping someone could give my hair the help it needs to grow. Not enough to think it's medical, but I just don't know where to turn. I've always wanted longer hair, especially with how pretty my curls would make it. Anyway, how much hair falling out every shower is considered normal??? lol Also, I feel like it's important to mention that I don't deal with a lot of split ends. Just my hair being dry. I did a porosity test with some of my hair, and the hair floated on the top, meaning low porosity. Does anyone have my same type of hair, and know products they LOVE?\n\nLong story short, I want long hair and healthy curls. Obviously, the curls won't get to perfection if I continue to get highlights, but I feel like my hair could still be SO much better and reach its full potential while still being blonde. I just don't know what to do. I would appreciate any and every advice I can get. Feel free to suggest any routines, products, hairdressers, etc.!!!! I'm located in North Fulton County in Georgia.\n\n  \nThank you so much!!!",
