I had a major pimple breakout between the ages of 17 and 21. When things got worse I consulted a dermatologist and got on sebum medication. It worked but by then I had major pimple scarring. I did not do anything about it until now and I have started this skin care routine about a month ago. I am very new to this and even this routine I researched on reddit and started. I am not seeing any results but I feel better after doing this. Can you all suggest me what to do or how to tweak this or if I am even doing the right things and combinations? Thanks.",
