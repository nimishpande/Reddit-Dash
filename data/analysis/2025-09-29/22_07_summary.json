I had a major pimple breakout between the ages of 17 and 21. When things got worse I consulted a dermatologist and got on sebum medication. It worked but by then I had major pimple scarring. I did not do anything about it until now and I have started this skin care routine about a month ago. I am very new to this and even this routine I researched on reddit and started. I am not seeing any results but I feel better after doing this. Can you all suggest me what to do or how to tweak this or if I am even doing the right things and combinations? Thanks.",

Now, I am using deconstruct niacin-amide face wash and started avoiding soap on face. But ever since i started doing this, i am feeling like my face becoming more oily and greecy, making it look dull. Whereas, cintol would make my skin so clear and would keep it like that throughout the day.\n\nNow, i shifted to a routine, where i am using soap while taking bath in the morning, and using the face wash before sleep with a serum and a moisturiser.\n\nShould I continue what works for me, or should i use face wash only for my skin. \n",
