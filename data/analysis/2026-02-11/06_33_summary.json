      "title": "[Acne] Has anyone experienced a sudden, persistent break out like this?",
      "content": "Hi all! I’m F24 and looking for any insight into how my skin might have deteriorated so quickly in such a short amount of time.\n\nI went from oily acne prone but smooth skin to complete cystic, on entire face in 2-3 months. I’ve also had an outbreak of perioral dermstitis. I’m currently on accutane, but want to maybe understand what happened and how to prevent it in the future. I'm so sad I might have ruined my skin and might not be able to continue with the accutane due to other side effects.\n\n**Retracing my steps:**\n\nApologies for the Novel lol.\n\nI have always had oily, acne prone skin, and bad picking tendencies.\n\nI first went to a derm a year ago regarding a few too many pesky pimples that scared me. Looking back it was literally nothing but I hated having any bumps and knew I was best at not picking my skin when it was clear. The derm diagnosed me with rosacea, and prescribed me clindamyacin+benzoyl peroxide cream. It burned my face day 2 so I stopped using it and kind of considered her a dud.\n\nI continued using a gentle routine and occasionally BP or SA on spots with varying success.\n\nMy biggest focus was finding an SPF that worked for me: Any kind of chemical sunscreen would make my face flush and burn and break out. Zinc worked best, but it was heavy and often formulated with oils that caused CCs. I also struggled with removal- I had been double cleansing, once with oil, then again with regular face wash. I avoided washing my face in mornings to avoid stripping. I started a few vitamins and diet improvements hoping they would help my skin.\n\nEventually I just gave up on actives and just started using zinc cream on everything, and just washing at night and moisturizing. An spf I used over the summer was a suspect in causing a bunch of closed comedones, so I stopped using any spf once the UV hit 2 in my area.\n\nSeptember was also when I started feeling extremely stressed out due to a few different events in life, but they were silly and I didn’t expect them to change my life much. I also began a prescribed VitD supplement once a week.\n\nIn October of 2025, I experienced a break out of tiny red bumps all over my cheekbones. I thought it was rosacea type 2, panicked, immediatley went back to the derm (same one, she was just closest and covered by insurance)\n\nShe prescribed me Soolantra and metrogel. I was consistent with the Soolantra for 8 weeks but gave up when my skin barrier started feeling worse and I saw zero improvement, and an increase in cystic pimples.\n\nMy skin went down hill from there. My entire face erupted, despite keeping my routine extremely gentle, and the breakouts suddenly started leaving dark spot and red spots. This had never happened to me before.\n\nI went back to the derm, who suggested either spirolactone or accutane. I chose to start the iPledge process with accutane because the idea of having to take spirolactone indefinitely seemed unappealing to me. However, I was also PETRIFIED of accutane. I spent the entire month long waiting period crying and stressed about my skin, and starting the drug. Obviously my skin did not improve lol.\n\nI was given Clindamyacin for the POD, which has helped a lot. Did nothing for the acne though.\n\nI’m now on 20mg a day and constantly second guessing my choice. I was so sick of my skin freaking out at everything and just wanted to nuke it, but now I’m torturing my entire body with this drug.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\nMy rosacea makes my skin not tolerate so many things. I cannot use retinols or exfoliants because it just freaks my skin out. I can’t use chemical sunscreens. Anything vaguely comedogenic gives me closed comedones. It seems like accutane is my only option.\n\nI have tried cutting all kinds of things from my diet as well, but realized I was losing weight I could not afford to lose. So restricting is not really a viable option. I thought accutane could be a workaround so I don’t have to cut out eggs or cheese or bread.\n\n**Potential causes:**\n\nStress\n\nDiet\n\nDestroyed my barrier\n\nB12? (I stopped the b12 when my skin got worse, but it did not improve after 2 months, so probably not)\n\nHigh vitamin D dose? Or the deficiency?\n\nBad reaction to gentle products (S.Nature Rice Fomaing cleanser and Geek and Gorgeous Hydration Station)\n\n**More background:**\n\nI do not drink. I do not smoke. I don’t eat out more than 2x a month. I don't even drink coffee. I change my pillowcase daily. I use clean towels to dry my face. Clean hands for product application. Billions of pimple patches have been used. 6-9 hours of sleep a night, working on improving that. Zero drug use. I work out daily. Lots of yoga.\n\nI got my hormones tested right before starting accutane as well, came back healthy and clean and whatnot. My thyroid is fine, all my blood work is fine other than Ferretin and Vit D which I take supplements for.\n\n***Thank you*** to anyone who took the time to read or even skim this. Any relatable stories are also greatly appreciated. I can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel right now and appreciate any answer or comments",

I'm a 22F with sensitive, dry, acne prone skin struggling on and off for a few months now with acne along my lower cheeks and jawline (like [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/rgdwuh/acne_never_used_to_be_breakout_prone_but_all_of_a/#lightbox) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3uemi8/acne_i_have_never_in_my_life_even_had_a_blemish/)) and I don't know how to get rid of it. So far, even with my routine, the only way for me to actually get rid of these closed comedones(???) is by squeezing [these little things](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/91ee2u/acne_anyone_else_extract_bulb_like_sack_things/) out which ends up giving me really bad hyperpigmentation that takes forever to fade. Is it something in my routine that's giving me these or is it something else? (mold exposure possibly from my new apartment, diet but that hasn't changed since high school, lack of sleep and/or stress, menstrual cycle hormone changes, pillowcase???) Please help me and let me know if there are better/more effective products that I can use 🙏 Any advice and opinions are appreciated!",

I’ve recently noticed how heat damaged my hair is. There’s split ends everywhere, which is why I want to stop using heat tools on my hair. The only thing is that I don’t know which products are best for my hair, and that I know my hair will look ridiculous for a little while because of how damaged it is. I want to train my hair back to its natural pattern. This is my air dried hair after sleeping with no products in it whatsoever, so I don’t really have a routine. I don’t use a fancy pillowcase and I have a bonnet but don’t usually use it. I washed my hair with the Tresemme Flawless Curls Conditioner and the Tresemme 24 Hour Volume Shampoo. All advice to start my hair healing journey is appreciated!!",

It is less curly, much darker, and generally looks greasy (see second), despite my efforts. I had not been maintaining my own hair at the time the first picture was taken, so I was hoping someone would share a routine that could get it back into shape.\n\nCurrent routine:\nI wash daily before bed with Ouidad moisture restoring shampoo. In the morning, I condition with Ouidad cleansing conditioner and detangle with a wide-tooth comb. I have been using curlsmith strong hold gel, dividing my hair evenly into two sections and applying to the scalp as well. Finally, I apply strictly curls mousse and diffuse.\n\nThe routine is certainly not great. As a guy, I was never really taught how to treat my hair properly. I want to take back some of my personal agency and really improve the way my curls look. Anything helps!",

It helps with softness, but my hair sometimes ends up looking a bit heavy or lifeless. Pomade keeps things more controlled, but it also seems to flatten out my waves.\n\nMy hair is around 2a/2b and takes a long time to dry. I wash regularly because my hair tends to build up easily, even when I’m not using many styling products. I air dry my hair and rarely use a blow dryer. I’m trying to find a routine that brings out more wave definition and volume without weighing my hair down. \n\nAny styling tips or product suggestions would be appreciated.",
