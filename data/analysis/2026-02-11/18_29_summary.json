      "title": "Updated curly hair routine, in the hopes it will help someone! Can be found under the photo",
      "content": "Hello hello! If you're here then I'm assuming you've come to look for my hair routine and what I do to get results like these, and you've come to the right place!! It's taken me over a year to figure out how to look after my hair because I'm the only one in my family with curly hair, but thanks to my lovely friends and tiktok of course, I've been able to get better at doing it! I've got a long way to go to find what works for me but here is my latest curl routine.\n\n1. I start by wetting my hair in the shower. Then I detangle. I only ever do it when it's wet and as soon as I'm able to run a brush through my hair without it catching, that's when I know I'm good! \n\n2. I then double shampoo, the first time being to get rid of any gunk or whatever on my hair, the second time to actually clean my hair properly. The first time, I use head and shoulders because that's what my dad buys and it cleans my scalp nicely, and the second time, I go in with a hydrating shampoo. Currently I'm using the one by Phyto. \n\n3. I go in with some Sukin Hydrating Conditioner.Thiw is an Australian brand so you may not have it where you are, but I find this works for me really well. If not though any old hydrating conditioner will do. \n\n4. Depending on how dry my hair feels, I sometimes go in with a bit of a hair mask by Tsubaki. I'm not really sure which one or where to get that because it was a random one my mum didn't want and have me but as with all my other products and things I use, any old hair mask will do! \n\n5. Sometimes I like to use a Denman brush to brush style in the shower. I do this and then make sure I don't disturb the curl clumps before I get out of the shower. Recently though I've taken to using a dupe of the Bounce curl brush that I found at City Beach for $10. If you decide to use that, it can be done in or out the shower, but if out the shower, it should be done after resetting and applying leave in and curl cream. \n\n6. After getting out of the shower, I use a bit of Garnier Aloe Vera leave in conditioner. I don't like to use too much because I don't like when my hair feels product heavy but feel free to experiment with how much you need! \n\n7. Then, curl cream. I like the one by Hask. I only ever use the teeniest tiniest amount to again prevent my hair being product heavy, we're talking a literal smudge for each section of hair. I don't always section but if I do, then it's into top and bottom and left and right. if not though I just use a slightly bigger smudge of curl cream and add it into my hair \n\n8. I plop my hair in a t shirt until it's 50% dry. I don't own a diffuser and don't intend to get one because I don't like the idea of heat damage, but I do fine without one anyway! Plopping helps my hair hold its shape a bit before I add gel to set it \n\n9. After plopping, I go in with gel. I use a decent amount on each side because of course I've taken my hair out of its sections and it's just left and right, and I'd describe it as how much you'd put if the gel were moisturiser for your face if that makes sense? And I never rake it through. I use praying hands and then scrunch my hair to really get it in there. Lately I've been using the one by Umberto Giannini but I also love the one by Cake! It smells absolutely delicious \n\n10. I leave my hair to air dry and then I'm done! I try to avoid touching it as much as possible. Then once it's dry I scrunch out the gel cast with my hands and separate any huge curl clumps. And that's all! I typically wash my hair every four days because I can't stand leaving it any longer but it lasts me well provided I take the time to do a good job\n\nI hope this helps someone here!! Any questions feel free to ask me!! ",

      "content": "Hey Tressless fam,\n\nLong-time lurker, finally ready to share my experience. I'm 6 months post-op from my hair transplant in Turkey and wanted to share my research process since I see a lot of questions about going abroad.\n\n**Background:** 28M, Norwood 3, been on fin for 2 years which stabilized things but wanted to address the temples. Got quotes from 3 US clinics ranging from $12k-$15k for \\~2500 grafts. That's when I started researching Turkey.\n\n**My Research Process:**\n\nI spent 3 months comparing options. Here's what I looked at:\n\n**Turkey Options I Researched:**\n\n* **Smile Hair Clinic (Istanbul)** \\- 4.9/5 on multiple platforms, 4900+ reviews\n* **Vega Hair Clinic (Antalya)** \\- Solid reputation, beach location was tempting\n* **MediHairs (Istanbul)** \\- Good reviews, slightly higher price\n* **ꓧеаꓲtһꓧор packages** \\- Found them through Reddit actually, they work with vetted clinics and handle all the logistics ([https://healthhop.com/hair-transplant-turkey-exclusive-package/](https://healthhop.com/hair-transplant-turkey-exclusive-package/))\n\n**What I compared:**\n\n* Surgeon credentials (this is CRITICAL - don't just go for cheapest)\n* Actual before/after photos (not stock images)\n* What's included (hotel, transfers, aftercare)\n* Technique (FUE vs DHI)\n* Reviews from multiple sources (Reddit, RealSelf, Google)\n\n**My Decision:**\n\nEnded up going through ꓧеаꓲtһꓧор's all-inclusive package ($2,700 vs their regular $3,300 - caught a promotion). Here's why:\n\n1. They pre-vetted the clinics (saved me anxiety)\n2. Everything coordinated - hotel, transfers, translator\n3. 24/7 support (used it twice, super helpful)\n4. Same surgeon did my entire procedure (some clinics use techs)\n\n**What was included:**\n\n* 3 nights at a legit 4-star hotel\n* All transportation (they picked me up at airport)\n* The actual procedure (\\~2800 grafts, they went higher than estimate)\n* Post-op kit and meds\n* Follow-up care\n\n**6 Month Results:**\n\nNot gonna lie, months 2-4 were rough (shock loss, ugly duckling phase). But now at 6 months I'm seeing real density. My hairline looks natural, not pluggy. Still have 6+ months of growth to go but already worth it.\n\n**Cost Breakdown:**\n\n* Turkey (ꓧеаꓲtһꓧор): $2,700 all-in\n* Flight: \\~$800\n* Extra expenses: \\~$300\n* **Total: \\~$3,800**\n\nvs US quote: $12,000+ (just the procedure, no hotel/travel included)\n\n**Saved: \\~$8,200**\n\n**Would I do it again?** 100% yes. But DO YOUR RESEARCH. Not all Turkish clinics are equal. Some are hair mills. I spent hours reading Tressless posts, checking doctor credentials, and comparing options.\n\nHappy to answer questions. Also still on fin (1mg daily) and added min to the routine post-op.\n\n**TL;DR:** Did extensive research, went with vetted Turkey clinic through medical tourism coordinator, saved $8k+ compared to US, 6 months in and results looking solid.",

Welp, the results are in the third picture. The top isn’t good either, but the ends were horrible, they were greenish-black. I needed to get rid of it fast. This was on last saturday. Next day I did the Head&amp;Shoulders method to try to get the color off but it didn’t work completely, seen on the 4th picture.\n\nFifth&amp;Sixth&amp;Seventh picture: today I did Color B4 hair color remover which mind you leaved my hair COMPLETELY BOTCHED like there are so many dark pieces it’s horrible. \n\nPlease tell me how to fix this 😭😭 \n\nMy questions are: \n\nHow long do I need to wait until I can color my hair again? \n\nWhat box dye should I use?

      "content": "(Btw first picture is how my curls looked in the summer, second is how it looks now, and third is all the products i use. Oh and this isn’t my hair, i’m a hijabi so I can’t show my hair but this is very very similar to how my hair looks and looked)\n\nSo I have what I think are 3a curls. For my whole life, I just thought I had frizzy straight hair until people told me I should try a curl routine. Last summer, I finally tried curl cream and mousse. Surprise, surprise, it actually looked nice for the first time ever! I went down a total rabbit hole wanting to define my curls even more. Since my hair was down to my butt, I decided to get a layered cut to help with definition.\n\nI went to a hairstylist while on vacation in my home country. I only asked for a layered cut, but she ended up pressuring me to blow dry and straighten my hair. I caved and did it, even though it totally defeated the purpose of me going to the salon. When I got back and washed it, I expected my curls to bounce back, but they didn’t, they just stayed straight. I waited, thinking they’d come back, but fast forward seven months and my hair is still only slightly wavy and barely curly compared to how it was last summer.\n\nI don’t think it’s heat damage because my hair is still very soft, I get regular trims, and I haven't used heat since I was 10 years old until that one day. Before the cut, my hair was straight in length and I had plenty of bouncy ringlets. Even before my hair dried, the curls would be pretty prominent. Now that I have the U/V shape layers, it’s done the opposite of what I wanted. I have maybe 2 ringlets in the front of my shirt that falls flat as well after a few hours. I’ve been told by some people that it’s the cut, and by others that the salon straightening ruined my pattern.\n\nAt this point, I’m just trying to make my curls look good again. Whenever I style it, it looks okay ish right after I put products in, but after a few hours of air drying, it falls flat and looks more wavy than curly. I sleep in a bonnet using the pineapple method, but by the second or third day, it falls even flatter. By day four or five, it looks like 2a waves if I'm lucky. It’s so frustrating.\n\nFor my routine, I shampoo twice, use a hair mask for 20 minutes, and then the blue Skala conditioner. Out of the shower, I use the orange Skala leave in, curl cream, style with the Bounce Curl brush, and finish with mousse.\n\nBack in the summer when my hair looked best, I only used cream and mousse, no masks or leave ins. so I don't know if I'm weighing it down or if it's the lack of a diffuser and gel. My mom won't let me buy or use gel because she’s convinced it bad for your hair.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to make my hair hold its shape for more than a few hours? Thanks 🥹🙏",

      "content": "Hi, first time posting here. Hope i’m tagging this correctly! \n\nSo lately i’ve been getting these ridiculous cluster whiteheads on my chin and around my mouth for the last 2 months. Every day there is a new whitehead. I’m no stranger to whiteheads and sebaceous filaments and i can usually get them under control, but this amount with this much frequency is new. Every day there is a new pimple. I’ll put a pimple patch on before bed and wake up and they’re gone, but then later that night they’re back, sometimes reoccurring in the same problem spots or creating new problem spots. \n\nI have oily/combo skin. I’m not new to skincare and i have kept the same routine pretty consistently for the last few years with small tweaks here and there where needed. I used to have great skin and now it’s just…. This.\n\nI am currently dealing with some major life stressors but idk if that could contribute? \n\nMorning: \n\nCerave sa cleanser\n\nCosrx blackhead toner (every second day, mostly nose + chin)\n\nCosrx galactomyces 95\n\nSkin1004 bakuchiol eye cream\n\nAnua rice glow milky toner\n\nBeauty of joseon relief sun aqua fresh\n\nNight:\n\nCerave sa cleanser\n\nCosrx blackhead toner\n\nCosrx galactomyces 95\n\nHada labo hyaluronic acid \n\nSome by mi retinol eye cream\n\nCerave blemish control resurfacing retinol serum\n\nDr althea 345 relief cream\n\nIs it hormonal?

Is it okay to have such noticeable difference between face and chest?\n\nAlso, when I visited a dermatologist, ,initially she suggested me some chemical peels and hydra facial etc also earlier I used to have some acne. So first we treated the acne now acne is gone. She Told me to apply some tropical like nicinamide and retinol serum because as per my dermatologist i have hyperpigmentation , so I have been using nicinamide for quite some time now, like it's been eight months. yet I still feel that my face has been burned and there are no such changes in my skin texture tone. So recently I visited my dermatologist again after seven months, so she said that I have a lot of acne  scars. That is why this problem is looking more dominant and again, she suggested me to use retinol and asked me to done have some procedures done like micro needling  and chemical peels and also said only applying topical will not help me. I should go for some chemical treatment as well.\n\nShould I change my dermatologist and consult someone else? Or stick to this one and apply the topicals like retinol and nicinamide which are prescribed and i also use sunscreen daily .\n\nMy primary goal is to have an even skin texture and tone, like I want my face skin tone to be somewhat similar to my natural skin, which is on my chest and other body parts.\n\nSuggest me what should i do!",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm 29 and for the past 3 years I've been struggling with deep forehead lines. I've had them for at least 8 years but I feel they've been worse for the last 2-3. They also seem to be much worse in the winter. I work outdoors and wear sunscreen daily (there were a couple years in there where I didn't... I know, not good) but haven't seen a change. I also tried Tret for about 6 months and OTC retinol for 6 months but didn't see any changes, and I've tried Frownies for about 6 mo-1yr and would see a smooth forehead for an hour or two, and then they'd be back, even if I didn't make any expressions. I also moisturize every day and night using Palmer's cocoa butter lotion (might be crazy, but my skin likes it) -- other than that and sunscreen, I don't typically put anything on my face.\n\nI feel like the lines take over my whole face in certain lighting, so I'm pretty self conscious of them. Any ideas for topicals or treatments that could help? I'm not really open to Botox, so any other suggestions would be super helpful :) I've also been working on self-acceptance and I'm okay with most things (grey hairs, even), but these drive me NUTS!\n\n3 pics are attached!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4o3jbnriwig1.jpg?width=1567&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd69cabd32f0beceff8c64e46ebcc73d3922c131\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9lwq6bnriwig1.jpg?width=3697&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f43b7dd96252ba1bf38237e7d69f84aa65d4a6e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dazf6bnriwig1.jpg?width=1336&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fbe701dccacbd577a0408a4ecfa19028906ef4b\n\nThanks so much in advance!!!",

I've done so many different things the past 10 years to make my hair look acceptable somehow (we're nkt even talking good..) but nothing seemed to work out. Since we moved to an apartment with very hard water 2 years ago, everything got even worse.\nThe routine that makes my hair look like in the picture:\n- L'oreal Glycolic Gloss Shampoo, Conditioner and 5-minute intense hair lamination\n- Brush hair with conditioner in it, Plopping and  then air dry\n(From one of my other posts in this community I was being told that I maybe use too many after shower products (incl gel) and should focus on shower care and masks and maybe try something with Glycolic acid to help with the hard water issues. Thats why I skipped all hold products to see the \"ground state\" of my hair, which is Hagrid..)\n\nI have issues with my scalp so I can't do the cgm without shampoo or just co-wash since my scalp is falling off from this (tried several times within the past 10 years). My hair also dries sooooooo slowly (10-14 h) and if I add hold products like gel it takes even longer. Once there is slight humidity outside, my curls basically look like the picture again. Since I have a very busy work week and also do cardio several times per week, I usually only get 2-3 hours per day after work, I just gave up on these extensive curl routines after showering because they were draining the life out of me even more 😅\n\nIm just so fed up of never having a real hairstyle and never really being able to wear my hair down. I feel like my hair just massively downgrades my overall looks which is dragging on me lately 😅\n\nIs there really no solution to make my hair somehow look acceptable without having to spend tons of money or invest many hours per week? If anyone has been at my point and can offer any advice, I would be so thankful..",
