Afterward (yes, I know 😅) I watched a Mel tutorial and ended up doing pretty much exactly what she did.\n\nRoutine: I washed my hair three days ago with Elvive dream length shampoo and conditioner, used taft heat protection, scrunched in moroccanoil mousse and taft gel, then diffused. Today I refreshed by wetting my hair and using heat protection, mousse and gel and diffusing. I sleep with a bonnet at night but I also ordered a silk scarf because I’m really not pleased with the bonnet head I have to deal with in the morning ",

Cleansing: Previously Based Bodyworks shampoo and Bouclème Hydrating Shampoo/Conditioner (full scalp/length application).\n\n2.  Other products: Bouclème styling gel/cream (applied to soaking wet hair via praying hands + \n\nscrunch).\n\n3.  Drying: Air-dried only (no diffusing/heat).\n\n4.  Other notes: Trying a modified Curly Girl approach but struggling with oiliness, buildup, and curl consistency. No consistent bonnet/silk pillowcase use.\n\nHas anyone found evidence-based or well-tolerated natural-ish products/routines for curly hair that provide good moisture without heaviness, maintain strong curl pattern, minimize buildup, and have neutral/mild scents? Please share what worked for you (products, brands, application tips). Thank you!",

      "title": "[DIY] I Fell Down the Fermented Rice Water Rabbit Hole (And Now I'm Questioning Everything)",
      "content": "So three weeks ago, I stumbled across this post from a woman who swore by fermented rice water for shrinking her pores. Like, genuinely swore by it. The kind of enthusiasm that makes you stop scrolling and actually pay attention. I'm 23, male, and I've been dealing with visible pores and some lingering hyperpigmentation from a previous breakout, so I figured why not? What's the worst that could happen? That question is now keeping me up at night.\n\nI did what any rational person would do: I went full research mode. A couple hours of reading about how rice water fermentation has been used for centuries across Asia, how the process supposedly increases bioavailability of beneficial compounds, how it's been a beauty staple passed down through generations. The science seemed sound enough. The anecdotal evidence was overwhelming. I was sold.\n\nHere's the thing though. I study biotechnology, so I know enough to be paranoid about contamination. I wasn't about to follow some recipe blindly and end up culturing something nasty on my face. So I developed what I'd call an obsessively sterile protocol.\n\nMy process goes like this: one cup of rice, one cup of water. First rinse gets discarded to remove any surface impurities. Second wash is where the magic happens. I rub and massage the rice between my hands for a good while, really working it to release as much as possible. Hands freshly disinfected with alcohol, nails trimmed short. The rice water sits with the grains for about an hour to extract the good stuff, then I transfer only the liquid to a glass bowl and let it ferment in a dark spot at stable room temperature for exactly 24 hours. After that, it goes into a spray bottle that's been thoroughly cleaned with soap and disinfected with 70% alcohol. Then straight to the fridge.\n\nEvery utensil gets the same treatment. Soap first, then 70% alcohol spray, let it evaporate completely. I'm trying to minimize external contamination while letting the rice's native microorganisms do their thing. The whole batch gets used within a week, then I start fresh. New batch, newly sanitized bottle, the whole routine. I read that making it with genuine koji spores can extend shelf life to two weeks, but I don't have access to those, so I play it safe.\n\nCost wise? It's almost laughable how cheap this is. In Mexico, 250 grams of rice runs me maybe 30 to 40 cents USD. The value proposition is honestly insane.\n\nNow here's where it gets interesting. For two weeks, this stuff has been really good for my skin. My pores look noticeably smaller. My skin feels calmer, especially helpful since I use tretinoin. That stubborn hyperpigmentation seems to be fading. The smell after 24 hours of fermentation is distinctive but not at all unpleasant. If it ever smelled bad, I'd toss it immediately, but that's never happened.\n\nSo naturally, feeling good about my discovery, I decided to dig deeper into Reddit to see what others were experiencing. And that's when I found the other side of the story. People breaking out. Posts about fungal acne. Warnings about contamination. Someone who fermented theirs for a full week and said it smelled like actual shit (which, yeah, that tracks). The contrast is stark. On one hand, centuries of traditional use and my own positive experience. On the other, people claiming it wrecked their skin.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what's different. The woman in the original post ferments hers for a week and doesn't mind the strong smell. I stop at 24 hours specifically to avoid that. She doesn't refrigerate. I do. Maybe that's the difference? Maybe the fermentation sweet spot is narrower than people think? Or maybe some skin types just don't play well with this, regardless of how it's prepared?\n\nI want to believe the sterile technique matters. That my biotech background is actually helping me do this safely. But I also know that even with perfect aseptic practices, fermentation is inherently unpredictable when you're working with wild cultures. Every batch could be slightly different. Every person's skin microbiome is different.\n\nSo here I am, genuinely conflicted. Part of me wants to keep going, the other part thinks maybe I should quit. What do you all think? Should I keep riding this wave or jump ship before something goes wrong? Has anyone else had success with shorter fermentation times? Or am I just playing Russian roulette with my face and getting lucky?\n\nI'd genuinely love to hear from people who've tried this, whether it worked or bombed. Because right now I'm stuck between traditional wisdom and modern horror stories, and I honestly don't know which side to trust.",

I'm a 22F with sensitive, dry, acne prone skin struggling on and off for a few months now with acne along my lower cheeks and jawline (like [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/rgdwuh/acne_never_used_to_be_breakout_prone_but_all_of_a/#lightbox) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3uemi8/acne_i_have_never_in_my_life_even_had_a_blemish/)) and I don't know how to get rid of it. So far, even with my routine, the only way for me to actually get rid of these closed comedones(???) is by squeezing [these little things](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/91ee2u/acne_anyone_else_extract_bulb_like_sack_things/) out which ends up giving me really bad hyperpigmentation that takes forever to fade. Is it something in my routine that's giving me these or is it something else? (mold exposure possibly from my new apartment, diet but that hasn't changed since high school, lack of sleep and/or stress, menstrual cycle hormone changes, pillowcase???) Please help me and let me know if there are better/more effective products that I can use 🙏 Any advice and opinions are appreciated!",

I have combination skin and super dry on my t zone while still being oily. It wreaks havoc on my makeup and I've tried so many primers with no luck. I always prep my skin well and started using a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid that I got from a beauty subscription. It's fantastic but I'm almost out. I can't find the brand in Canada and I'm not paying an outrageous amount to get it from the states. So anyway, help me out?! Please?! ✌️🫶",

I do a lot of outdoor sports and forget to reapply sunscreen. I wear a headscarf and the difference is obvious between the part of my face that is covered and the part that is not (see pictures for reference).\n\nThe routine is as follows: \n\n* Eucerin dermopure cleanser\n* Centella oil cleanser only for days when I wear makeup (and I rarely do)\n* Eucerin dermopure moisturizer\n* HT CEUTIC depigmentation cream : applied every other evening\n* Differine (adapalene) : applied every other evening (alternating with the depigmentation cream)\n* La roche vitamin C12 : applied on the hyperpigmented spots in the morning\n* La roche anthelios sunscreen (oil control gel-cream) : reapply every 2 hour (I try lol)\n\n  \nThe dermatologist said that my skin leans towards the oily skin type. \n\nIn the past week I noticed my skin peeling in my nose, under my eyebrows, and now my cheeks. I don't see a visible change in the hyperpigmented spots yet. \n\nSometimes when I apply the vitamin C12 serum, if I touch or try to apply something on top of it it just rolls of as a layer of dirt.\n\nAm I doing something wrong? Or is this a normal process of the skin healing itself? \n\nYour input would be much appreciated!\n\n",
