      "content": "Hi all! I’m F24 and looking for any insight into how my skin might have deteriorated so quickly in such a short amount of time.\n\nI went from oily acne prone but smooth skin to complete cystic, on entire face in 2-3 months. I’ve also had an outbreak of perioral dermstitis. I’m currently on accutane, but want to maybe understand what happened and how to prevent it in the future. I'm so sad I might have ruined my skin and might not be able to continue with the accutane due to other side effects.\n\n**Retracing my steps:**\n\nApologies for the Novel lol.\n\nI have always had oily, acne prone skin, and bad picking tendencies.\n\nI first went to a derm a year ago regarding a few too many pesky pimples that scared me. Looking back it was literally nothing but I hated having any bumps and knew I was best at not picking my skin when it was clear. The derm diagnosed me with rosacea, and prescribed me clindamyacin+benzoyl peroxide cream. It burned my face day 2 so I stopped using it and kind of considered her a dud.\n\nI continued using a gentle routine and occasionally BP or SA on spots with varying success.\n\nMy biggest focus was finding an SPF that worked for me: Any kind of chemical sunscreen would make my face flush and burn and break out. Zinc worked best, but it was heavy and often formulated with oils that caused CCs. I also struggled with removal- I had been double cleansing, once with oil, then again with regular face wash. I avoided washing my face in mornings to avoid stripping. I started a few vitamins and diet improvements hoping they would help my skin.\n\nEventually I just gave up on actives and just started using zinc cream on everything, and just washing at night and moisturizing. An spf I used over the summer was a suspect in causing a bunch of closed comedones, so I stopped using any spf once the UV hit 2 in my area.\n\nSeptember was also when I started feeling extremely stressed out due to a few different events in life, but they were silly and I didn’t expect them to change my life much. I also began a prescribed VitD supplement once a week.\n\nIn October of 2025, I experienced a break out of tiny red bumps all over my cheekbones. I thought it was rosacea type 2, panicked, immediatley went back to the derm (same one, she was just closest and covered by insurance)\n\nShe prescribed me Soolantra and metrogel. I was consistent with the Soolantra for 8 weeks but gave up when my skin barrier started feeling worse and I saw zero improvement, and an increase in cystic pimples.\n\nMy skin went down hill from there. My entire face erupted, despite keeping my routine extremely gentle, and the breakouts suddenly started leaving dark spot and red spots. This had never happened to me before.\n\nI went back to the derm, who suggested either spirolactone or accutane. I chose to start the iPledge process with accutane because the idea of having to take spirolactone indefinitely seemed unappealing to me. However, I was also PETRIFIED of accutane. I spent the entire month long waiting period crying and stressed about my skin, and starting the drug. Obviously my skin did not improve lol.\n\nI was given Clindamyacin for the POD, which has helped a lot. Did nothing for the acne though.\n\nI’m now on 20mg a day and constantly second guessing my choice. I was so sick of my skin freaking out at everything and just wanted to nuke it, but now I’m torturing my entire body with this drug.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\nMy rosacea makes my skin not tolerate so many things. I cannot use retinols or exfoliants because it just freaks my skin out. I can’t use chemical sunscreens. Anything vaguely comedogenic gives me closed comedones. It seems like accutane is my only option.\n\nI have tried cutting all kinds of things from my diet as well, but realized I was losing weight I could not afford to lose. So restricting is not really a viable option. I thought accutane could be a workaround so I don’t have to cut out eggs or cheese or bread.\n\n**Potential causes:**\n\nStress\n\nDiet\n\nDestroyed my barrier\n\nB12? (I stopped the b12 when my skin got worse, but it did not improve after 2 months, so probably not)\n\nHigh vitamin D dose? Or the deficiency?\n\nBad reaction to gentle products (S.Nature Rice Fomaing cleanser and Geek and Gorgeous Hydration Station)\n\n**More background:**\n\nI do not drink. I do not smoke. I don’t eat out more than 2x a month. I don't even drink coffee. I change my pillowcase daily. I use clean towels to dry my face. Clean hands for product application. Billions of pimple patches have been used. 6-9 hours of sleep a night, working on improving that. Zero drug use. I work out daily. Lots of yoga.\n\nI got my hormones tested right before starting accutane as well, came back healthy and clean and whatnot. My thyroid is fine, all my blood work is fine other than Ferretin and Vit D which I take supplements for.\n\n***Thank you*** to anyone who took the time to read or even skim this. Any relatable stories are also greatly appreciated. I can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel right now and appreciate any answer or comments",

I’m very grateful for it and now trying to fully **embrace my natural curls** as it continues to grow.\n\nI’ve always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with my hair. It was wavy when I was younger and became curly in my 20s, but I struggled with frizz and lack of definition. In the past, I often kept it short, but this time I’d like to let it grow and learn how to take care of it properly without relying on heat.\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n1) Cleanse\n   * *Cantu Sulfate-Free Cleansing Cream Shampoo*\n   * Alternated with a hard water shampoo (used occasionally for buildup)\n2) Condition\n   * *Acure Smooth &amp; Shine Conditioner\n   * Applied mainly to mid-lengths and ends, then rinsed out\n3) Styling (on soaking-wet or very damp hair):\n   * *Cantu Curl Activator Cream* **or**\n   * *SheaMoisture Curl Mousse* (lighter option)\n   * *Aveda smoothing cream used in the past, not very effective.*\n4) Application technique:\n   * Products applied with hands using light raking, followed by scrunching\n   * No brushes used for styling\n5) Drying:**\n   * Air-dry in summer\n   * In colder months, partial dry mixed with diffusing\n\n The photo I’m referencing is a day post-wash and my curls still look messy and undefined to me.\n\n**Hair &amp; Lifestyle Info**\n\n* Fine, curly hair (post-chemo regrowth)\n* Side sleeper\n* Full-time job + kids\n* Prefer a **simple routine under 20 minutes**\n\n**What I’m Looking For**\n\nI’d love recommendations for:\n\n* Products that give **better curl definition** for fine hair\n* Lightweight gels, mousses, or creams that help reduce frizz\n* Tips for improving **day-1 and next-day curls**\n* Low-effort nighttime protection options\n\nThank you so much in advance — any advice is truly appreciated 💛",

I started my curly hair journey around 6 months ago and I’ve been experimenting a lot, but I’m still struggling with the same issue:\n\nMy problem\n\nThe top and mid sections of my hair curl okay, but the lower parts and ends always stay straight.\n\nMy hair history\n\nDuring my teenage years, I didn’t know how to style my hair, because as soon as I brushed it, it would turn into a lion’s mane. So I used regular keratin treatments to straighten it. I stopped doing keratin 2.5–3 years ago. Since then, I’ve cut my hair multiple times, but the ends still look straight and weird, whereas the roots come out curly, so it means the keratin isnt the problem as I have chopped off the part that was straightened by the Keratin.\n\nI also haven’t used any heat styling or straightening in over 6 months.\n\nMy current routine:\n\nShampoo/Conditioner: Head &amp; Shoulders \n\nLeave-in: Garnier Method for Curls mask\n\nCantu Shea Butter Wave Whip Curling Mouse\n\nCantu Shea Butter Moisturizing Twist Lock &amp; Curl Gel\n\nMethod: Scrunch, then use a microfiber towel to scrunch more\n\nDrying: Air dry a bit, then diffuse\n\nFinishing: Aussie Work That Curl lightweight oil\n\nMy question\n\nWhat can I do to help my ends curl?\n\nDo I even have curly hair, or is it hopeless?\n\nWhy do the ends stay straight even after months of no heat and regular cutting?\n\nAny help or suggestions would be amazing. Thank you!",

My hair in these photos- I used some eco gel, serum, and John Frieda heat protector spray, and let it dry in a towel for about 30 minutes before applying the product and diffusing (usually I will let it air dry almost completely then diffusing). Before these pics I also did a hair food banana mask.\n\nI know I won’t get neat curls or ringlets because my hair is wavy. But I’d like it to feel a bit more presentable and not frizzing up.

I’m aware it’s a bone structure issue, and I also have thinner under eye skin and some discoloration.\n\nI know I can’t use topical products to dramatically alter appearance as it is a bone structure issue. But I’m wondering if there are any products that can plump up the under eyes a bit and reduce the discoloration I have. Would love to hear from others who also have sunken eyes - what all have you guys tried? Not looking for invasive options like fillers at this time, but I am open to any product recommendations like natural, Korean beauty, etc or even just a note of helpful ingredients",

I've had terrible acne forever, but this August after using TO retinol in squalane I got closed comedones all over my face. These pics are from my journey back to clear skin. Sorry for the weird face I'm making sucking in my lips but it's the best way to actually see the closed comedones.\n\nMy routine varied a lot, but currently it's: \n\nAM\n- Rinse\n- Anua Azelaic 10 \n- Cosrx snail 92\n- Mixsoon Bean eye cream \n\nPM\n- Quo makeup remover or Life hydrating gel cleanser (CeraVe dupe)\n- Anua Azelaic 10 \n- cosrx Aha power liquid (2x a week)*\n- cosrx BHA power liquid (2x a week)*\n- cosrx snail 82\n- haruharu Black Rice bakuchiol eye cream \n- Vaseline on my forehead and undereyes\n\n*These don't currently do much for me, but I'm just using them up. I used them 3-4x a week initially and I think that's why you can see my skin look a lot drier and more peeling in pics #3 and #4. \n\n Between pics 3 &amp; 4 I took a course of collagen supplements (vitality glow marine collagen + biotin, which also has vitamin C). Between pics 4 and 5 my naturopath prescribed me supplements which I've currently been taking for one month. I'm supposed to take then for 3 months and then reevaluate. Honestly the supplements have done the most for me overall. \n\nI have done extensive testing of my hormones and have no issues there. I also went to a dermatologist for 3-4 years before going to a naturopath out of pure desperation. Every derm visit I would show up, my derm would look at me for 1 minute, give me a prescription and rush out. I would take the prescription, it would do nothing for me, and I would get side effects. So I would go back to the derm and he'd do something different with a different drug. \n\nI also tried cutting out all dairy completely for 3 months. That also didn't do much for me. The supplements have honestly been a godsend but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say which ones they are or if it's a good idea bc my naturopath (naturopathy is licensed and regulated where I live and naturopaths can prescribe many medications as well as supplements) prescribed them with me in mind, and I don't want anyone to hurt themselves.
