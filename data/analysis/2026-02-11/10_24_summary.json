I'm a 22F with sensitive, dry, acne prone skin struggling on and off for a few months now with acne along my lower cheeks and jawline (like [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/rgdwuh/acne_never_used_to_be_breakout_prone_but_all_of_a/#lightbox) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3uemi8/acne_i_have_never_in_my_life_even_had_a_blemish/)) and I don't know how to get rid of it. So far, even with my routine, the only way for me to actually get rid of these closed comedones(???) is by squeezing [these little things](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/91ee2u/acne_anyone_else_extract_bulb_like_sack_things/) out which ends up giving me really bad hyperpigmentation that takes forever to fade. Is it something in my routine that's giving me these or is it something else? (mold exposure possibly from my new apartment, diet but that hasn't changed since high school, lack of sleep and/or stress, menstrual cycle hormone changes, pillowcase???) Please help me and let me know if there are better/more effective products that I can use 🙏 Any advice and opinions are appreciated!",

Since then, it has grown quite a bit, although it’s noticeably **finer than it used to be**. I’m very grateful for it and now trying to fully **embrace my natural curls** as it continues to grow.\n\nI’ve always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with my hair. It was wavy when I was younger and became curly in my 20s, but I struggled with frizz and lack of definition. In the past, I often kept it short, but this time I’d like to let it grow and learn how to take care of it properly without relying on heat.\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n1) Cleanse\n   * *Cantu Sulfate-Free Cleansing Cream Shampoo*\n   * Alternated with a hard water shampoo (used occasionally for buildup)\n2) Condition\n   * *Acure Smooth &amp; Shine Conditioner\n   * Applied mainly to mid-lengths and ends, then rinsed out\n3) Styling (on soaking-wet or very damp hair):\n   * *Cantu Curl Activator Cream* **or**\n   * *SheaMoisture Curl Mousse* (lighter option)\n   * *Aveda smoothing cream used in the past, not very effective.*\n4) Application technique:\n   * Products applied with hands using light raking, followed by scrunching\n   * No brushes used for styling\n5) Drying:**\n   * Air-dry in summer\n   * In colder months, partial dry mixed with diffusing\n\n The photo I’m referencing is a day post-wash and my curls still look messy and undefined to me.\n\n**Hair &amp; Lifestyle Info**\n\n* Fine, curly hair (post-chemo regrowth)\n* Side sleeper\n* Full-time job + kids\n* Prefer a **simple routine under 20 minutes**\n\n**What I’m Looking For**\n\nI’d love recommendations for:\n\n* Products that give **better curl definition** for fine hair\n* Lightweight gels, mousses, or creams that help reduce frizz\n* Tips for improving **day-1 and next-day curls**\n* Low-effort nighttime protection options\n\nThank you so much in advance — any advice is truly appreciated 💛",

      "title": "Best Human Hair Extensions for Medical Hair Loss? My Honest Take",
      "content": "When my alopecia started getting worse and my crown hair began thinning, I could literally see my scalp in photos. It was heartbreaking. My scalp was becoming visible, especially under bright light, and no hairstyle could properly hide it. Because of my medical issue, I was losing confidence day by day. That’s when one of my close friends recommended Gemeria Hair, calling it one of the best human hair extension brands for real and natural-looking hair toppers.\n\nInstead of ordering online directly, I decided to visit the Gemeria Hair studio, and honestly, that made a huge difference in my experience. The team there was extremely helpful and understanding about alopecia and medical hair thinning. They didn’t rush me at all. First, they carefully checked my crown area and explained which size and base type would work best for my hair loss pattern.\n\nThe best part? They made me try different kinds of hair toppers, silk base, mono base, smaller coverage, and even slightly larger coverage options. I could actually see the difference in volume and scalp coverage in real time. It helped me understand what looks natural on me instead of just guessing.\n\nI finally chose a human hair topper that blended perfectly with my natural hair texture and color. Since it’s made from 100% real human hair, it feels soft, smooth, and completely natural. No one can tell I’m wearing anything. The scalp illusion looks so real that even I forget sometimes.\n\nWhat I really love is how lightweight and breathable it is. I can part my hair freely, style it with heat tools, and even tie a low ponytail without worrying. It instantly covers my visible scalp and gives natural volume to my crown area.\n\nFor someone dealing with alopecia and crown hair loss due to a medical issue, finding the right solution is emotional. But visiting the studio, trying different toppers, and getting proper guidance made the process comfortable and confidence-boosting.\n\nIf you’re searching for the best human hair extensions or a natural-looking hair topper, I personally recommend Gemeria Hair. For me, it wasn’t just a product, it was a confidence comeback.",

      "title": "[DIY] I Fell Down the Fermented Rice Water Rabbit Hole (And Now I'm Questioning Everything)",
      "content": "So three weeks ago, I stumbled across this post from a woman who swore by fermented rice water for shrinking her pores. Like, genuinely swore by it. The kind of enthusiasm that makes you stop scrolling and actually pay attention. I'm 23, male, and I've been dealing with visible pores and some lingering hyperpigmentation from a previous breakout, so I figured why not? What's the worst that could happen? That question is now keeping me up at night.\n\nI did what any rational person would do: I went full research mode. A couple hours of reading about how rice water fermentation has been used for centuries across Asia, how the process supposedly increases bioavailability of beneficial compounds, how it's been a beauty staple passed down through generations. The science seemed sound enough. The anecdotal evidence was overwhelming. I was sold.\n\nHere's the thing though. I study biotechnology, so I know enough to be paranoid about contamination. I wasn't about to follow some recipe blindly and end up culturing something nasty on my face. So I developed what I'd call an obsessively sterile protocol.\n\nMy process goes like this: one cup of rice, one cup of water. First rinse gets discarded to remove any surface impurities. Second wash is where the magic happens. I rub and massage the rice between my hands for a good while, really working it to release as much as possible. Hands freshly disinfected with alcohol, nails trimmed short. The rice water sits with the grains for about an hour to extract the good stuff, then I transfer only the liquid to a glass bowl and let it ferment in a dark spot at stable room temperature for exactly 24 hours. After that, it goes into a spray bottle that's been thoroughly cleaned with soap and disinfected with 70% alcohol. Then straight to the fridge.\n\nEvery utensil gets the same treatment. Soap first, then 70% alcohol spray, let it evaporate completely. I'm trying to minimize external contamination while letting the rice's native microorganisms do their thing. The whole batch gets used within a week, then I start fresh. New batch, newly sanitized bottle, the whole routine. I read that making it with genuine koji spores can extend shelf life to two weeks, but I don't have access to those, so I play it safe.\n\nCost wise? It's almost laughable how cheap this is. In Mexico, 250 grams of rice runs me maybe 30 to 40 cents USD. The value proposition is honestly insane.\n\nNow here's where it gets interesting. For two weeks, this stuff has been really good for my skin. My pores look noticeably smaller. My skin feels calmer, especially helpful since I use tretinoin. That stubborn hyperpigmentation seems to be fading. The smell after 24 hours of fermentation is distinctive but not at all unpleasant. If it ever smelled bad, I'd toss it immediately, but that's never happened.\n\nSo naturally, feeling good about my discovery, I decided to dig deeper into Reddit to see what others were experiencing. And that's when I found the other side of the story. People breaking out. Posts about fungal acne. Warnings about contamination. Someone who fermented theirs for a full week and said it smelled like actual shit (which, yeah, that tracks). The contrast is stark. On one hand, centuries of traditional use and my own positive experience. On the other, people claiming it wrecked their skin.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what's different. The woman in the original post ferments hers for a week and doesn't mind the strong smell. I stop at 24 hours specifically to avoid that. She doesn't refrigerate. I do. Maybe that's the difference? Maybe the fermentation sweet spot is narrower than people think? Or maybe some skin types just don't play well with this, regardless of how it's prepared?\n\nI want to believe the sterile technique matters. That my biotech background is actually helping me do this safely. But I also know that even with perfect aseptic practices, fermentation is inherently unpredictable when you're working with wild cultures. Every batch could be slightly different. Every person's skin microbiome is different.\n\nSo here I am, genuinely conflicted. Part of me wants to keep going, the other part thinks maybe I should quit. What do you all think? Should I keep riding this wave or jump ship before something goes wrong? Has anyone else had success with shorter fermentation times? Or am I just playing Russian roulette with my face and getting lucky?\n\nI'd genuinely love to hear from people who've tried this, whether it worked or bombed. Because right now I'm stuck between traditional wisdom and modern horror stories, and I honestly don't know which side to trust.",

I’m aware it’s a bone structure issue, and I also have thinner under eye skin and some discoloration.\n\nI know I can’t use topical products to dramatically alter appearance as it is a bone structure issue. But I’m wondering if there are any products that can plump up the under eyes a bit and reduce the discoloration I have. Would love to hear from others who also have sunken eyes - what all have you guys tried? Not looking for invasive options like fillers at this time, but I am open to any product recommendations like natural, Korean beauty, etc or even just a note of helpful ingredients",
