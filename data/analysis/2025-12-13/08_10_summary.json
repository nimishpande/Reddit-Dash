      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Or is there anything I should stop doing? \n\nThanks for your feedback and suggestions!",

Shampoo twice (Head &amp; Shoulders, then Ors creamy Aloe Shampoo), then conditioner (currently I use SheaMoisture curl conditioner and Aussie deep conditioner in rotation). \n\n2. I apply curl cream (SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie) into really wet hair, think seaweed hair. I brush it through completely. Then I apply Herbal Essences Volumizing Mousse and brush it through completely. It is my favorite hold product.\n\n3. I brush style it in sections and carefully scrunch afterwards.\n\n4. Sometimes I apply a gel cast after brush styling, but this time I didn't do it. If I do, I would mix Aussie Instant Freeze Gel with water in my hands and carefully apply it all over my hair.\n\n5. Diffuse carefully. First 10 mins hover diffusing upside down, then a mix of pixie diffusing and cup diffusing until dry.\n\n6. When my hair is 100% dry, I rub hair oil (Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine) in between my hands and gently scrunch my hair and shake out my roots.\n\nIn order to keep my hair looking like that pretty much throughout the week, I use a silk pillowcase and just carefully flip my hair over from underneath when sleeping. When taking a shower, I put my hair in a ponytail, fix it with a clip and then use a shower cap.",

I've had quite sensitive red-ish back acne for nearly 3 years now, I feel like I've tried everything and I wanted to ask before I went to a dermatologist. It usually goes through cycles of bad flaring up for about a month then calms down for a while and is usually worse on my upper back and shoulders, but its been pretty heavily scarred throughout the years.  I shower twice a day after any exercise, exfoliate my back with a net scrubber that I change out every 2-3 weeks, eat relatively clean, change my bedsheets every 2 weeks and drink a good amount of water. The only real \"products\" if you can call them that are different bodywashes/bodyscrubs so any recommendations on what to try from here before I go to a derm would be awesome, thanks!

In between, I wet her hair down with a water spray bottle and a few spritz of detangler and brush with her tangle teezer brush, then use a pea sized amount of curl defining style cream and scrunch and zhoosh her hair a bit.

Water soluable is a MUST HAVE for us.

It doesn’t really affect how the hair looks so I don’t mind, but the amount of damage and shedding is not nice to deal with.\n\n  \nI do think I’m using my hair to hide myself a little too.

      "title": "Specific situation, Accutane advice needed [Acne]",
      "content": "Hi all, I’m looking for advice on whether or not starting accutane will help me in my specific situation. 20F :)\n\nI’ve had quite bad acne from around the age of 11 and have always had oily skin genetically. My cystic acne started around age 15 and always left dark scars, I was 170cm 58kg/127lbs at that time and for pretty much most of my life (this will be important later). Anyway, it was quite bad to the point that I went to see a dermatologist at 17 and actually got a script for accutane ***(photos 1-4)***. I decided not to take it as I wanted to see whether I could try out other acne products, exfoliators, cleansers, moisturisers etc before making a permanent change to my body.  \n\nI tried using a bunch of different cleansers (with salicylic acid, what-have-you…), treatments (vitamin c, niacinamide), exfoliators (bha), and many different moisturisers (mattifying, very light hydrating ones…) and eventually with some treatment my acne actually subsided and my scars cleared up a bit ***(photos 5-6)***. At least I thought it was because of the treatments, because I’ve now realised that it must have been because of my hormones; at age 18-20 I was diagnosed with anorexia, my lowest weight was about 45kg/99lbs at 170cm/5’7 but I hovered around 48kg/105lbs for a couple years. I’ve now recovered to around 53kg/116lbs, and I’m noticing that my cystic acne and oily skin is starting to reappear ALREADY ***(photo 7)***. Despite never stopping any of the cleansers/treatments I was doing!! My endocrinologist said that my hormones had essentially shut down (I lost my period for that whole time but have regained one recently) and are starting back up again, so it’s entirely plausible that my acne disappeared because of a lack of the hormones and not because of my treatments, and because I’m regaining weight my hormones are coming back, and so is the acne.\n\nMy dilemma is this: my cystic acne has ALREADY started to reappear, and my doctor tells me I have to go from 53 -&gt; 58kg. To be even just on the lower end of a healthy weight, I have no choice. I thought I had fixed my acne problem but I’m genuinely scared at the thought of it ever getting that bad and uncomfortable again — it’s already started to come back and my hormones aren’t even at their full capacity (I have only gotten ONE period and have missed the past 3, for example). I know my acne isn’t quite what it used to be, but given my history, I’m inclined to believe it’ll return to that state sooner than later once I return to my normal weight. Is there any advice anyone could give me on whether accutane would be right in my situation given my history, or any similar experiences anyone could share?? And whether it would be best to maybe start it asap to minimise new scarring? (Because, side note, I’m supposed to start hydroxychloroquine for an autoimmune disease, UCTD, I developed in the past couple years as well. I could perhaps push it back for a year while I’m on accutane if taking them at the same time isn’t ideal, because I’ll be taking hydroxychloroquine probably for life. So it’d be now or never I guess?)\n\nI’m seeing the same dermatologist in a few days that I saw those few years ago who previously gave me the accutane script in order to get a new one, because I’m leaning towards starting it. Anything you can say is appreciated! Thank you.",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I'm hoping to get some help on what to buy my bf to help him get (and keep) his hair healthier. He's finally become open to trying a new shampoo and conditioner and asked me to figure out what he should use. \n\nHis hair is mid-back length. He has never gotten a trim since he started growing it out 6 years ago. His current routine is as follows: \n\n1. Wash hair as needed (maybe 2x a week) with Head &amp; Shoulders 2-in-1\n2. Wrap hair in a bath towel while he does other things (I'm trying to get him to switch to a t-shirt or microfiber towel)\n3. (Sometimes) dry it with a blowdryer (no diffuser)\n4. Finger comb it dry over the next several days. When he gets down to tiny knots, pull the hair until it breaks out of the knot. You can hear it snap. (I have been trying to educate him on how bad this is, he thinks it's the only way to get the knots out...)\n\n[Pictures of his hair here](https://imgur.com/a/MUXXZ6j). From L to R: fresh out of the shower 1.5 years ago (it's gotten more damaged looking since then), a few hours post-shower (more recent), 1 day out, and maybe 1.5 days out. By the end of day 2, that ponytail is one large knotted mass. You can see that it starts out looking nice and curly fresh out of the shower, and then slowly becomes more dry, straight, frizzy, and matted looking.\n\nHis hair tangles very easily and is constantly a pile of knots, to the point that it does sometimes mat. He spends significant time each day \"unknotting\" it, leaving piles of hair everywhere in the process. The bottom 6-8 inches always looks much dryer and frizzier than the hair above it, and idk if that's from damage, his handling the hair to detangle it, or both.\n\nI did finally convince him to get a trim to get rid of any damage he may have with my haircutter next Wednesday (she is not a curl specialist), and she understandably asked that we try and get many of the knots out before the appointment. I'm planning to lather him with conditioner and brush it out with my Wet Brush while the conditioner is still in, as per the guide. I expect this to take multiple hours and may take multiple sessions.\n\nHere are some of the reasons I'm struggling with picking products for him:\n\n- his hair seems to be low porosity (it's tough to get it wet and it takes forever to dry on its own), so it seems co-washing is not recommended\n- it also looks like it's really dry, but all the low porosity recommendations are less moisturizing\n- He gets dry skin flakes (at least that's what I think it is, he won't see a derm). Head &amp; Shoulders seems to help but is not enough to stop it \n- He's extremely sensitive to textures and hates the idea of being able to feel any kind of film or waxiness or build-up in his hair post-shower. He is against using gels for this reason as well\n\nI've read the wiki but between all of the above and the low likelihood of him doing anything but the simplest of routines, I don't know where to start. Any product tips or advice?",

My routine is l’oréal elvive color safe wash, and verb ghost conditioner, then when soaking wet I use the curlsmith flexi jelly all over with praying hands and lightly scrunch. I usually diffuse a little and then mostly air dry. Sometimes I use the rizos curl cream instead of gel! I also clarify using ouais clarifying shampoo once a week. \n\nPic 2 is what my hair looks like day 2 no matter what. I have tried satin pillow case, pineapple and no matter what I get straight pieces that look kind of fried and I always end up completely re wetting to make it look decent. \n\nPic 3 is what my hair looks like when photographed and I’m hoping for haircut advice so it looks less flat? I’ve never gotten a curl specific hair cut but I really like the shag style cuts where it gets rid of the triangle shape. Any advice is welcomed!\n\nTo note: I have fine hair, but a lot of it (I think??) I color my hair with level 10 developer but I am sure that I probably have some damage related to that. I’m open to any advice!!!",

      "content": "The sunscreen applies very smoothly and feels lightweight initially. It gives a nice dewy finish right after application, which looks good on camera or in indoor lighting.\n\nHowever, after some time, it tends to make my skin look oily and slightly dull. In real-life lighting (not cameras), the dewy finish doesn’t translate well and instead looks greasy on my combination skin. If layered over a moisturiser, it feels too heavy and oil-like for me.\n\nThat said, I cannot deny its sun protection. I’ve used it during peak June summers and it genuinely helped prevent sunburn and tanning. The protection is solid and reliable.\n\nOverall, I think this sunscreen works better as a high-protection option for harsh summers or prolonged sun exposure, rather than an everyday sunscreen for combination skin. It’s a good product, but the hype didn’t work out for me personally.\n\nWould love to hear others’ experiences or recommendations for combo/oily skin sunscreens with a more natural finish and budget friendly :)",
