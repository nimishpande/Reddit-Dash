      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi all. I have extremely thick curly hair, type 3a / possibly 3b about halfway down my back in length, and decently healthy/taken care of. However, I'm at my wits end trying to manage the physical pain that it brings me. \n\nIt feels like everything I do with my hair brings me pain. My wash-day brushouts hurt like hell and take me near an hour each time. Putting my hair up to protect it after a wash hurts, taking a clip or scrunchie out of my hair to take it down hurts, sleeping with the weight of my hair on top of my head hurts, anyone touching my hair hurts-- it just never stops. \n\nI've gotten a mat in my hair twice in the past two months, both times from simply sleeping with my hair in a low ponytail for one night. Those both led to me struggling to brush it out for an hour plus (sectioning all the other hair away, brushing from bottom to top) and eventually just cutting a small chunk out of my hair to make the pain stop. \n\nIf anyone has advice for how to help at all, it would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to cut my hair short again, as this is the longest it's been since I was a kid, but I really don't know how much more I can handle. \n\nMy care routine is:\n- Wash my hair 2-3 times a week using Mielle rosemary+mint shampoo and Marc Antony Simply Curls conditioner \n- Brush my hair out with a wetbrush in the shower every wash when soaking wet and full of conditioner.\n- put up in a towel for about 10 minutes and then bundle it all in a claw clip on the very top of my head to sleep.\n\nI typically wear my hair up in large claw clips, in two low braids, or in a scrunchie/low bun when close to wash day. I feel like these are pretty protective styles, but it feels like no matter what I do, I get endless tangles. \n\nI have tried sleeping in a tie-front silk bonnet but it won't reliably stay on my head overnight. \n\nI'm not someone who does well with long care routines or tons of products as I just simply don't have the time and energy to devote so much more to my hair than I already do. \n\nAny advice/suggestions/ideas/anecdotes welcomed. Thank you!! ",

Shampoo twice (Head &amp; Shoulders, then Ors creamy Aloe Shampoo), then conditioner (currently I use SheaMoisture curl conditioner and Aussie deep conditioner in rotation). \n\n2. I apply curl cream (SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie) into really wet hair, think seaweed hair. I brush it through completely. Then I apply Herbal Essences Volumizing Mousse and brush it through completely. It is my favorite hold product.\n\n3. I brush style it in sections and carefully scrunch afterwards.\n\n4. Sometimes I apply a gel cast after brush styling, but this time I didn't do it. If I do, I would mix Aussie Instant Freeze Gel with water in my hands and carefully apply it all over my hair.\n\n5. Diffuse carefully. First 10 mins hover diffusing upside down, then a mix of pixie diffusing and cup diffusing until dry.\n\n6. When my hair is 100% dry, I rub hair oil (Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine) in between my hands and gently scrunch my hair and shake out my roots.\n\nIn order to keep my hair looking like that pretty much throughout the week, I use a silk pillowcase and just carefully flip my hair over from underneath when sleeping. When taking a shower, I put my hair in a ponytail, fix it with a clip and then use a shower cap.",

The ‘routine’ i have includes washing my hair twice a week, the first with a suave clarifying shampoo until it suds, rinse and then I do the same thing with a Herbal Essences rose hips shampoo, rinse and then Herbal Essences rose hips conditioner, i’ll put some on either side of my head and brush it out with my fingers, and then with a wet brush. I put it in a bun and rinse it out 20 minutes later. The second wash of the week is the same, just without the first clarifying shampoo. I don’t put any product in (don’t know where to start for my hair type), I air dry (i’m lowkey scared of blowdryers but it’s a fear i could get over) and that’s it. \nSome sections get ringlets, some twist and turn in on itself and a curl starting clockwise ends counter clockwise, i’m struggling with “brushing my hair makes it lose everything that was holding it close to my head” but the people that say it looks unkempt don’t know when they tell me to just brush it, it makes the problem 10x worse. \nI’d like to know my curl pattern and any tips!

My routine is l’oréal elvive color safe wash, and verb ghost conditioner, then when soaking wet I use the curlsmith flexi jelly all over with praying hands and lightly scrunch. I usually diffuse a little and then mostly air dry. Sometimes I use the rizos curl cream instead of gel! I also clarify using ouais clarifying shampoo once a week. \n\nPic 2 is what my hair looks like day 2 no matter what. I have tried satin pillow case, pineapple and no matter what I get straight pieces that look kind of fried and I always end up completely re wetting to make it look decent. \n\nPic 3 is what my hair looks like when photographed and I’m hoping for haircut advice so it looks less flat? I’ve never gotten a curl specific hair cut but I really like the shag style cuts where it gets rid of the triangle shape. Any advice is welcomed!\n\nTo note: I have fine hair, but a lot of it (I think??) I color my hair with level 10 developer but I am sure that I probably have some damage related to that.

It only blocks type 2 of the 5 alpha reductase enzyme leading to around a 60% reduction in serum DHT levels while Dutasteride blocks both type 1 and type 2 of the enzyme leading to an over 90% reduction in serum DHT. Dutasteride is frequently prescribed off label for hair loss and may be an option for those who are a little more aggressive with balding where finasteride would not be enough. For those who have taken Dut what was your experience?  To me it seems if you go little harder with the DHT blocking effects you may see more results or regrowth compared to Finasteride with the drawback that you have a higher risk of experiencing adverse effects.

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "The sunscreen applies very smoothly and feels lightweight initially. It gives a nice dewy finish right after application, which looks good on camera or in indoor lighting.\n\nHowever, after some time, it tends to make my skin look oily and slightly dull. In real-life lighting (not cameras), the dewy finish doesn’t translate well and instead looks greasy on my combination skin. If layered over a moisturiser, it feels too heavy and oil-like for me.\n\nThat said, I cannot deny its sun protection. I’ve used it during peak June summers and it genuinely helped prevent sunburn and tanning. The protection is solid and reliable.\n\nOverall, I think this sunscreen works better as a high-protection option for harsh summers or prolonged sun exposure, rather than an everyday sunscreen for combination skin. It’s a good product, but the hype didn’t work out for me personally.\n\nWould love to hear others’ experiences or recommendations for combo/oily skin sunscreens with a more natural finish and budget friendly :)",

I want to get something specific, but I can't find any images that I could give my hairdresser for reference. \n\nWhat I'm looking to get is (I'm a girl btw):\n- in the front, front of the ear basically, I want two long dense strands of hair on each side and bangs (long bangs across my forehead that reach my eyebrows maybe? that connect to the two strands)\n- in the back, behind the ear, I want the hair to be maybe like a pixie cut, to be very short at the nape(can't stand the feeling of hair on my neck) and get progressively longer towards the top, and with layers and textured\n\nI literally cannot envision what that would look like very well. I'm open to suggestions or alternatives that might look better if anyone more experienced has any ideas. \n\nLast time I tried explaining verbally to the hairdresser, and I basically ended up with a bob (for some reason when some salon ladies hear short hair on girls it automatically translates to bob cut to them) and the long strands of hair in the front and curtain bangs. She even asked me beforehand with this concerned judgy look if this is what I really wanted and I was so tempted to sarcastically say \"nah, lady, I lost a freaking bet\" after I tried to explain to her my idea very meticulously and detailed. 🥲\n\nAnyway, thank you in advance for any help!
