      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hi all. I have extremely thick curly hair, type 3a / possibly 3b about halfway down my back in length, and decently healthy/taken care of. However, I'm at my wits end trying to manage the physical pain that it brings me. \n\nIt feels like everything I do with my hair brings me pain. My wash-day brushouts hurt like hell and take me near an hour each time. Putting my hair up to protect it after a wash hurts, taking a clip or scrunchie out of my hair to take it down hurts, sleeping with the weight of my hair on top of my head hurts, anyone touching my hair hurts-- it just never stops. \n\nI've gotten a mat in my hair twice in the past two months, both times from simply sleeping with my hair in a low ponytail for one night. Those both led to me struggling to brush it out for an hour plus (sectioning all the other hair away, brushing from bottom to top) and eventually just cutting a small chunk out of my hair to make the pain stop. \n\nIf anyone has advice for how to help at all, it would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to cut my hair short again, as this is the longest it's been since I was a kid, but I really don't know how much more I can handle. \n\nMy care routine is:\n- Wash my hair 2-3 times a week using Mielle rosemary+mint shampoo and Marc Antony Simply Curls conditioner \n- Brush my hair out with a wetbrush in the shower every wash when soaking wet and full of conditioner.\n- put up in a towel for about 10 minutes and then bundle it all in a claw clip on the very top of my head to sleep.\n\nI typically wear my hair up in large claw clips, in two low braids, or in a scrunchie/low bun when close to wash day. I feel like these are pretty protective styles, but it feels like no matter what I do, I get endless tangles. \n\nI have tried sleeping in a tie-front silk bonnet but it won't reliably stay on my head overnight. \n\nI'm not someone who does well with long care routines or tons of products as I just simply don't have the time and energy to devote so much more to my hair than I already do. \n\nAny advice/suggestions/ideas/anecdotes welcomed. Thank you!! ",

We’re posting to provide clarification following a post shared yesterday that has resulted in false and misleading allegations about our business. Unfortunately, the situation has escalated online, with details being altered across multiple posts, which has caused confusion and led to negative commentary from people who were not involved in the appointment. \n\nWe want to outline what actually occurred from start to finish so the full context is available, as the facts of the appointment have not changed.\n\nThe client booked in for a full head of foils/ on scalp bleach, the starting price for this is from $420 \nDuring the consultation, the client had shown how she wished for her hair to look. The only way to achieve those results were with bleach (as booked). Visible banding was identified, which meant the service required to be changed to a colour correction rather than a standard full head of foils/ on scalp bleach. This is where the price changed to $520.\nAll our pricing and booking conditions can be found on our website. \n\nThe pricing was discussed in full during the consultation and prior to beginning any work. \nthe total cost was shown on our iPad including a break down of each service, alternative options were offered had this price been out of the clients budget\nA toner-only option was explained as a lower-cost alternative, with the clear understanding that the banding would reappear once the toner faded, for this we would not be liable as her existing colour was not done by us. \n\nDue to the condition of the hair, a k18 package treatment was recommended as an optional add-on, which the client agreed to. A haircut and styling were also included. The final total reflected the services discussed and confirmed prior to commencing. \n\nThe appointment took approximately 4.5 hours and involved two hairdressers working together. The service performed included on-scalp bleach, as well as through the mids due to banding, root tap, toner, k18 treatment, haircut and curls. This is not comparable to a simple tone and cut, which generally takes significantly less time.\n\nPayment options were discussed beforehand, including Afterpay and Zip Pay, and the client chose how they wished to proceed. No services were added without consent, and no pricing was presented after the fact.\n\nWe’re sharing this to provide full context and factual information, not to engage in arguments. We understand everyone’s budget is different, which is why we are upfront with pricing and always confirm details before proceeding\n\n",

According to the usual advice, you’re supposed to wait at least 4 hours before washing your hair or doing anything that might disturb it. That puts you at 11 am or later. By then, you’re probably not even at home anymore. You’re at work or outside.\n\nThen before you know it, it’s 7 pm and you’re supposed to apply the second dose. Once again, you’re waiting hours before you can wash, style, or touch your hair, and the day is basically over.\n\nSo for most of the day, if not all of it, your hair is messy, unstyled, and often dry, since a lot of people get dryness from minoxidil. It doesn’t smell great either. And this isn’t temporary. This is every day, forever.\n\nSo when exactly are you supposed to enjoy your hair?",

In between, I wet her hair down with a water spray bottle and a few spritz of detangler and brush with her tangle teezer brush, then use a pea sized amount of curl defining style cream and scrunch and zhoosh her hair a bit. She refuses to wear a bonnet to bed but we do have satin pillowcases for her.\n\nWe currently use cantu products that are not curly girl method approved or water soluable so I need help finding something new. Water soluable is a MUST HAVE for us. Her hair texture is very fine but she will likely have lots of hair (I need to get my hair thinned every 3 months). \n\nAny recommendations are appreciated, but try to keep it cheap if possible or a product that is good watered down to extend it's use.

I do wear an huge visor at the park and try to remain in shade whenever possible.\n\n* AM Routine\n* CeraVE Hydration Cleanser \n* Ordinary Buffet + Peptides \n* Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% \n* Sunday Riley Vitamin C Cream \n* Clinique Anti-Gravity \n* Clinique Moisture Surge \n* Summer Friday Tinted Moisturizer OR Dr Jarts Cicapair Color Correcting Treatment\n\nPM\n\n* CeraVE Hydration Cleanser \n* Ordinary Multipeptide Serum \n* Clinique Anti Gravity \n* Clinique Moisture Surge \n* Sunday Riley Luna Retinol Oil (or once a week I’ll do \n* Ordinary .2% Retinol and give my face a break) \n* More moisture \n* Dr Jarts Ceramidin Skin Sometimes Aquaphor on top of it at night.\n\nI started drinking Vital Collagen at night, and I’m desperately trying to hydrate all day.

My routine is l’oréal elvive color safe wash, and verb ghost conditioner, then when soaking wet I use the curlsmith flexi jelly all over with praying hands and lightly scrunch. I usually diffuse a little and then mostly air dry. Sometimes I use the rizos curl cream instead of gel! I also clarify using ouais clarifying shampoo once a week. \n\nPic 2 is what my hair looks like day 2 no matter what. I have tried satin pillow case, pineapple and no matter what I get straight pieces that look kind of fried and I always end up completely re wetting to make it look decent. \n\nPic 3 is what my hair looks like when photographed and I’m hoping for haircut advice so it looks less flat? I’ve never gotten a curl specific hair cut but I really like the shag style cuts where it gets rid of the triangle shape. Any advice is welcomed!\n\nTo note: I have fine hair, but a lot of it (I think??) I color my hair with level 10 developer but I am sure that I probably have some damage related to that. I’m open to any advice!!!",

      "content": "The sunscreen applies very smoothly and feels lightweight initially. It gives a nice dewy finish right after application, which looks good on camera or in indoor lighting.\n\nHowever, after some time, it tends to make my skin look oily and slightly dull. In real-life lighting (not cameras), the dewy finish doesn’t translate well and instead looks greasy on my combination skin. If layered over a moisturiser, it feels too heavy and oil-like for me.\n\nThat said, I cannot deny its sun protection. I’ve used it during peak June summers and it genuinely helped prevent sunburn and tanning. The protection is solid and reliable.\n\nOverall, I think this sunscreen works better as a high-protection option for harsh summers or prolonged sun exposure, rather than an everyday sunscreen for combination skin. It’s a good product, but the hype didn’t work out for me personally.\n\nWould love to hear others’ experiences or recommendations for combo/oily skin sunscreens with a more natural finish and budget friendly :)",

      "title": "Specific situation, Accutane advice needed [Acne]",
      "content": "Hi all, I’m looking for advice on whether or not starting accutane will help me in my specific situation. 20F :)\n\nI’ve had quite bad acne from around the age of 11 and have always had oily skin genetically. My cystic acne started around age 15 and always left dark scars, I was 170cm 58kg/127lbs at that time and for pretty much most of my life (this will be important later). Anyway, it was quite bad to the point that I went to see a dermatologist at 17 and actually got a script for accutane ***(photos 1-4)***. I decided not to take it as I wanted to see whether I could try out other acne products, exfoliators, cleansers, moisturisers etc before making a permanent change to my body.  \n\nI tried using a bunch of different cleansers (with salicylic acid, what-have-you…), treatments (vitamin c, niacinamide), exfoliators (bha), and many different moisturisers (mattifying, very light hydrating ones…) and eventually with some treatment my acne actually subsided and my scars cleared up a bit ***(photos 5-6)***. At least I thought it was because of the treatments, because I’ve now realised that it must have been because of my hormones; at age 18-20 I was diagnosed with anorexia, my lowest weight was about 45kg/99lbs at 170cm/5’7 but I hovered around 48kg/105lbs for a couple years. I’ve now recovered to around 53kg/116lbs, and I’m noticing that my cystic acne and oily skin is starting to reappear ALREADY ***(photo 7)***. Despite never stopping any of the cleansers/treatments I was doing!! My endocrinologist said that my hormones had essentially shut down (I lost my period for that whole time but have regained one recently) and are starting back up again, so it’s entirely plausible that my acne disappeared because of a lack of the hormones and not because of my treatments, and because I’m regaining weight my hormones are coming back, and so is the acne.\n\nMy dilemma is this: my cystic acne has ALREADY started to reappear, and my doctor tells me I have to go from 53 -&gt; 58kg. To be even just on the lower end of a healthy weight, I have no choice. I thought I had fixed my acne problem but I’m genuinely scared at the thought of it ever getting that bad and uncomfortable again — it’s already started to come back and my hormones aren’t even at their full capacity (I have only gotten ONE period and have missed the past 3, for example). I know my acne isn’t quite what it used to be, but given my history, I’m inclined to believe it’ll return to that state sooner than later once I return to my normal weight. Is there any advice anyone could give me on whether accutane would be right in my situation given my history, or any similar experiences anyone could share?? And whether it would be best to maybe start it asap to minimise new scarring? (Because, side note, I’m supposed to start hydroxychloroquine for an autoimmune disease, UCTD, I developed in the past couple years as well. I could perhaps push it back for a year while I’m on accutane if taking them at the same time isn’t ideal, because I’ll be taking hydroxychloroquine probably for life. So it’d be now or never I guess?)\n\nI’m seeing the same dermatologist in a few days that I saw those few years ago who previously gave me the accutane script in order to get a new one, because I’m leaning towards starting it. Anything you can say is appreciated! Thank you.",
