      "title": "My 4100 Grafts hair transplant surgery update.",
      "content": "\n\n\nHey everyone,\n\nAfter reading so many transformation stories here, I finally gathered the confidence to share my own. It’s been a full 12 months since my journey began, and honestly, choosing to go ahead with a hair transplant has been one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nI’m a 41-year-old doctor, but for years I looked much older than my actual age. I had a very large forehead, strong frontalis muscle activity, and a badly receding hairline. It affected me more than I’d like to admit. I avoided mirrors, disliked being photographed, and slowly my confidence started fading. I run a small hospital, so looking constantly tired or stressed didn’t help either.\n\nThe Surgery &amp; Choosing the Right Doctor\nI had been thinking about a hair transplant for a long time, but time was always an issue. Traveling to another city felt exhausting, and I was very clear about one thing—I didn’t want a “hair mill” setup where technicians do everything. I wanted a qualified doctor who personally performs the procedure.\n\nThrough one of my colleagues, I came across a doctor in Patna, and from the very first consultation, I felt comfortable. What impressed me most was that he didn’t just talk about the number of grafts—he talked about aesthetics. He carefully studied my face, age, muscle movement, and skin laxity, and explained why my case needed a customized approach.\n\nFirst Sitting &amp; Setbacks\nMy first surgery involved 3,500 grafts. Unfortunately, soon after the procedure, I went through a very stressful personal phase. Because of that, I couldn’t follow the post-op routine properly—diet, supplements, and overall care were not ideal for almost six months. Naturally, this affected the results.\n\nBy the 8th month, the outcome was decent, but deep down I felt something was still missing.\n\nSecond Sitting – A Grateful Moment\nWhen I discussed this with my doctor, he was incredibly understanding. He agreed to a second sitting for refinement—free of charge, except for a minimal OT cost. I wanted a slightly lower hairline and better density, and around 1,800 additional grafts were added to enhance the hairline peak and blend everything naturally. I’m genuinely grateful for his honesty and support.\n\nHairline Design – The Game Changer\nThis is what truly changed everything.\n\nInstead of giving me a straight, artificial-looking hairline, he designed a:\n\nTriangular, age-appropriate hairline\n\nOne that perfectly matches my face shape and muscle movement\n\nNot too low, not too youthful—just natural and balanced\n\nThe Real Journey (No Sugarcoating)\nMonths 1–3: Shedding, anxiety, stress, and poor aftercare\n\nMonths 4–6: Early signs of growth\n\nMonth 7: Good density, but I wanted a lower hairline\n\nMonth 8: Second surgery for refinement (1,800 grafts)\n\nMonth 12: Major transformation\n\nSome areas are still improving, and since it’s only 4 months after the second sitting, I feel I might gain another 20–30% density.\n\nHow I Feel Today\nFor the first time in years, I don’t look constantly stressed or older than my age. I finally see a version of myself that feels right. The confidence this has given me—both personally and professionally—is something I can’t put a price on.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nA hair transplant isn’t just about getting hair back—it’s about getting your confidence back.\n\nIf you’re thinking about it:\n\nChoose a doctor who designs, not just implants\n\nBe patient—it’s a long journey\n\nTrust the process\n\nI’m finally at a place where I truly like how I look, and that feeling is priceless.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or share pictures if anyone wants",

      "content": "Hi all. I have extremely thick curly hair, type 3a / possibly 3b about halfway down my back in length, and decently healthy/taken care of. However, I'm at my wits end trying to manage the physical pain that it brings me. \n\nIt feels like everything I do with my hair brings me pain. My wash-day brushouts hurt like hell and take me near an hour each time. Putting my hair up to protect it after a wash hurts, taking a clip or scrunchie out of my hair to take it down hurts, sleeping with the weight of my hair on top of my head hurts, anyone touching my hair hurts-- it just never stops. \n\nI've gotten a mat in my hair twice in the past two months, both times from simply sleeping with my hair in a low ponytail for one night. Those both led to me struggling to brush it out for an hour plus (sectioning all the other hair away, brushing from bottom to top) and eventually just cutting a small chunk out of my hair to make the pain stop. \n\nIf anyone has advice for how to help at all, it would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to cut my hair short again, as this is the longest it's been since I was a kid, but I really don't know how much more I can handle. \n\nMy care routine is:\n- Wash my hair 2-3 times a week using Mielle rosemary+mint shampoo and Marc Antony Simply Curls conditioner \n- Brush my hair out with a wetbrush in the shower every wash when soaking wet and full of conditioner.\n- put up in a towel for about 10 minutes and then bundle it all in a claw clip on the very top of my head to sleep.\n\nI typically wear my hair up in large claw clips, in two low braids, or in a scrunchie/low bun when close to wash day. I feel like these are pretty protective styles, but it feels like no matter what I do, I get endless tangles. \n\nI have tried sleeping in a tie-front silk bonnet but it won't reliably stay on my head overnight. \n\nI'm not someone who does well with long care routines or tons of products as I just simply don't have the time and energy to devote so much more to my hair than I already do. \n\nAny advice/suggestions/ideas/anecdotes welcomed. Thank you!! ",

Over time my acne has spiraled out of control I feel like my dermatologist doesn't know what she's doing anymore.\n\nFor some context, I have seborrheic dermatitis and\nvery sensitive skin. Benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid and salicylic acid all gave me really bad chemical burns, so my routine currently is just a gentle cerave cleanser and a hydrating cream to repair the damage the last treatment did. Both topical and oral antibiotics don't really do anything.\n\nI can't lower my testosterone dose any further, as I'm already on the lowest dose that keeps my levels within the acceptable range. I can't take accutane due to a prolonged history with suicidality and psychiatric hospitalizations.\n\nI do everything right. I wash my face properly, I change my pillowcases often, I don't touch my face with dirty hands and don't let anything else touch it either. I am lactose intolerant so there is absolutely no dairy in my diet. I do shave my face and neck everyday because I prefer the clean shaven look, but I use a high quality electric shaver that doesn't irritate my skin.\n\nI'm looking for product recommendations and just general advice.",

Like Merida from the movie Brave. I do not remember off the top of my head what shampoo she uses (I know I should). She uses a lot of oils on her hair and I know she talks a lot about how important it is to moisturize. That is as far as I know for her routine.\n\nDoes anyone with similar hair have any good hair diffuser that I could get her for Christmas? Preferably found on Amazon. I'm willing to spend good money on this for her so I just really care about the quality. After searching on Amazon, I saw that some of them did not get hot enough (she complains about this with her current hair dryer), and some other ones got too hot to the point where it burns hair and melts.\n\nI don't know much about haircare, especially with her hair because she is really careful with what she uses.

      "content": "Hi, I’m the guy who posted a week ago after getting a breakout from Nizoral. I want to thank everyone who replied to my last post.\n\nMy skin has improved since then. I’ve been using only SVR Topialyse Gel Lavant, and at this point I’m confident that my acne (or folliculitis) is bacterial.\n\nIf you look closely at the photos, you can see many small, skin-colored bumps. I suspect they might be closed comedones (what do you think?), and that they could be contributing to bacterial overgrowth and inflammation.\n\nWhere I live, I can’t find benzoyl peroxide washes, only gels. Also, because of the bleaching issue, BP wouldn’t have been my first choice anyway.\n\nI was thinking of trying salicylic acid to help exfoliate my skin. Do you think it could be effective in reducing new pustules?\n\nI’m leaning toward a salicylic acid wash because toners might be inconvenient to use on such a large surface. I’m just worried that washes might not be as effective.\n\nI’ve been looking at CeraVe Blemish Control Cleanser, which contains 2% salicylic acid. Are there better options?\n\nI also think my skin is quite dry (can you tell from the photos? I’m having a hard time finding out my skin type), although it doesn’t feel tight or itchy. I’m aware that salicylic acid can be drying, so I was thinking of starting by using the cleanser every other night and eventually increasing the frequency if necessary.\n\nI’d also start using a moisturizer. I was thinking of Purito Oat-in Calming Gel Cream or Purito Bamboo Panthenol Cream. I bought both, and I plan to apply one on my right pec and the other on my left for a week before starting the salicylic acid wash, just to make sure they don’t break me out. I’d also like to hear your opinion on these moisturizers and any recommendations for better ones in my situation.\n\nSorry for the wall of text. I really hope this situation improves because it’s frustrating.",

It only blocks type 2 of the 5 alpha reductase enzyme leading to around a 60% reduction in serum DHT levels while Dutasteride blocks both type 1 and type 2 of the enzyme leading to an over 90% reduction in serum DHT. Dutasteride is frequently prescribed off label for hair loss and may be an option for those who are a little more aggressive with balding where finasteride would not be enough. For those who have taken Dut what was your experience?  To me it seems if you go little harder with the DHT blocking effects you may see more results or regrowth compared to Finasteride with the drawback that you have a higher risk of experiencing adverse effects.

Shampoo twice (Head &amp; Shoulders, then Ors creamy Aloe Shampoo), then conditioner (currently I use SheaMoisture curl conditioner and Aussie deep conditioner in rotation). \n\n2. I apply curl cream (SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie) into really wet hair, think seaweed hair. I brush it through completely. Then I apply Herbal Essences Volumizing Mousse and brush it through completely. It is my favorite hold product.\n\n3. I brush style it in sections and carefully scrunch afterwards.\n\n4. Sometimes I apply a gel cast after brush styling, but this time I didn't do it. If I do, I would mix Aussie Instant Freeze Gel with water in my hands and carefully apply it all over my hair.\n\n5. Diffuse carefully. First 10 mins hover diffusing upside down, then a mix of pixie diffusing and cup diffusing until dry.\n\n6. When my hair is 100% dry, I rub hair oil (Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine) in between my hands and gently scrunch my hair and shake out my roots.\n\nIn order to keep my hair looking like that pretty much throughout the week, I use a silk pillowcase and just carefully flip my hair over from underneath when sleeping. When taking a shower, I put my hair in a ponytail, fix it with a clip and then use a shower cap.",

I'm open to suggestions or alternatives that might look better if anyone more experienced has any ideas. \n\nLast time I tried explaining verbally to the hairdresser, and I basically ended up with a bob (for some reason when some salon ladies hear short hair on girls it automatically translates to bob cut to them) and the long strands of hair in the front and curtain bangs. She even asked me beforehand with this concerned judgy look if this is what I really wanted and I was so tempted to sarcastically say \"nah, lady, I lost a freaking bet\" after I tried to explain to her my idea very meticulously and detailed. 🥲\n\nAnyway, thank you in advance for any help!

And I know lots of people use polyester satins, or silk in other fabric weaves (twill, etc) too. \n\nI can't find any kind of evidence/study/etc comparing fabrics or comparing weaves when it comes to haircare, honestly not even much anecdotal comparisons either. I'm sure both factors work together on some level, but do we have more information here?  \n  \nEspecially since it's almost winter, I'm wondering if any softer wool-like material like cashmere or merino would protect hair if it's in a fine weave or just soft to the touch, for example.  \n  \nOr if a knit beanie with a high silk content in the yarn would be gentle on hair, even though it's in a yarn/chunky knit form?\n\nWhat would you look for if you're expanding beyond silk and satin? Or should we really not expand much beyond those?\n\nThank you!",

Then at night I wash face again and use a dark spot removing serum which probably contains some retinol.\n\nCan you guys recommend some skin care routine? I am exposed to the sun, when I go for lunch and stuff but nothing excessive.\n\nMy skin looks okay right after washing and stuff but later starts to look dirty or just errm dead. The last photo is like 1 hour mins after washing, the first 3 are 6 hours after washing, i went to the mall, did some walking (no sun) I live in a tropical country where its always hot (no winter)\n\nI am new to this and the subreddit let me know if I should add any additional information.",
