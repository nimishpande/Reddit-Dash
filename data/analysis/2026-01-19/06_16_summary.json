      "content": "Now on the presumably \"tail end\" of my logarithmic reaction to my hair routine. Here's my stack and some commonly asked questions from my updates a quarter ago.\n\nRoutine:\n\n- .3% Finasteride, 6% Minoxidil topical combination. Applied originally via four .25ml sprays. Moved to a dropper bottle at month 4. Applied nightly 6x per week right before bed, have only missed 2 nights total.\n- Dermastamp (microneedle) 1mm once weekly before bed. Temples and scalp. I skip the topical on this night. \n- Keta shampoo, normal concentration, 3 mins on scalp once or twice a week.\n\nOther Considerations people asked about (probably didn't have much of a hair-effect):\n\n- I religiously take a multivitamin, fish oil, magnesium glycinate, and 5g of creatine daily.\n- I lift 4x weekly and play team sports once or twice weekly.\n- I sleep 8.5 hrs per night consistently.\n- I drink socially most weekends. In the back half of my 20s.\n- I am not sponsored, so I will not provide the brand name of the topical. It is safe to assume that it is the largest US men's hair regrowth company.\n- Receded lightly through college then thinned consistently for a year before deciding to do something about it.\n\nI have had zero side effects. None whatsoever. I know that is individual to myself but no need to ask in the comments, I promise I don't miss issues with my body when they arise.\n\nHappy to answer any remaining Qs or take any advice for further temple regrowth!\n",

No one taught me how to take care of my hair, and I just found out that my hair type is “Irish curls”? Which is apparently 2 hair types. Yotta yotta. Straighter on the top curler on the underneath. \n\nMy routine-\n\nNormally I just brush my hair before I shower, right now I’ve been using the Monday shampoo and conditioner and at first I really liked it with the first washes but now my hair is starting to feel a bit more dry and I’ve already trimmed my dead ends off once since buying it and I need to trim again. I think I started using it in October. I have a wide tooth comb for wet hair I just bought 2 weeks ago and I normally just wrap my hair up in a towel for a sec, then air dry.\n\nWhat are some good products that you can swear by that don’t damage or weigh down my hair? And any advice on how to get it to have more shine and less friz? Thank you for any suggestions. \n\nThe first photo is my hair after my last recent trim, I style my bangs with a straighter, forgot to mention that above. And the second one is before my trim. I haven’t taken recent photos. But my hair pretty much looks like the second photo rn. Maybe worse honestly ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Lately my pores(or blackheads?) have become really horrible, used to be just on my nose but now it’s also chin, forehead and cheeks. My skin is oily on my T-zone but the rest is pretty dry and flaky, which is lately causing lots of issues if I am wearing makeup.\n\nI am currently using the medicube zero pore 1day serum, b-bomb (niacinamide &amp; B12) from Geek&amp;gorgeous, hyaluronic acid from the ordinary and Neutrogena hydroboost water gel. Occasionally I use retinol from cerave, vitamin C from Geek&amp;gorgeous and Copper peptides from The Ordinary. Three times a week I use red light mask.\n\nI’m not sure if any of the products can be worsening my pores since I feel like this is the worst they have ever been plus I get a lot of what I think is clogged pores or pimples but they are just skin colored and never get red or become whiteheads. Noticed I get some milia under my eyes or on my cheeks as well lately. I do not use the b-bomb every day as I feel like it does have a tendency to cause some dryness so I use it occasionally or just as spot treatment on any pimples. For cleansing I use Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and micellar water. My skin is pretty sensitive.\n\nI have considered trying Curology as one of my friends recommended it, but I don’t really trust that they make it actually custom plus feel like they would try to give me more and more expensive things just to make money. Anyone have experience with that?\n\nThank you for any advice!",

I’ve always had those little dots everywhere though. I’ve never really known much about skincare because when I was on birth control my skin was flawless with no work, but I wanna fix the root issue rather than just taking the pill again. \n\nRight now I use Vanicream gentle facial cleanser usually just at night or whenever I shower, and then I moisturize with laroche posay moisturizer. I am sure there is something I could add or a better product I could use but I am completely at a loss! Any recommendations would be appreciated. :)",

I got a small patch of hair on my neck and the mustache hair is a bit darker. I’m stressed. My skin has gotten so bad.

      "content": "I recently went to the dermatologist to discuss options for acne scar treatment. She suggested something called Airgent to help with the “dents” in my skin. It costs $500 per treatment and would take a minimum of 2 treatments spread by about 3 months apart from each other. However she said that it was important that my acne had gone away. After 3 months of Seysara and 9-10 months of Cabtreo (which I still take along with Eucerin Radiant Tone to help with scarring) my acne has significantly improved and I feels like it has gone away, because I don’t remember the last time I had any cystic acne. She brought up possibly going on a cycle of Accutane before doing the treatment, and I was wondering if I should do that or go directly to getting the Airgent? Also any additional information on how well Airgent works would be greatly appreciated! 😁",

Lately, past couple months, my hair has been real weird. You can see that it some of the other pictures, though I don’t have any pictures of the worst days. Doesn’t want to lay right, it’s flat, and part of it wants to go in like the complete opposite direction than it should. How should I fix this? I really know very little about the hair world. And no, I’m not looking for attention because of the stage pics, the only time I take pictures of myself really is when I’m getting a promo picture for a show. It’s just frustrating, especially when it doesn’t even want to go the way it’s supposed to, it kind of really puts a dampener on my day. I feel like it’s easy to make my hairstyle look really bad. I just need some help, I don’t know what to do. I use a Revlon Brush dryer pro if that helps. Thank you for any and all advice or tips given.",

      "content": "Current Routine:\n\n* CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser, once daily\n* CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (the kind in the jar w/the pump)\n* Sometimes I use the CeraVe SA Cream as a spot treatment only\n\nDuration: About 6 years give or take\n\nThis routine was amazing for me at first, but at some point I seems like it just stopped working. My acne is still better than it was, but I feel like i should have seen more progress with this routine by now. I'm not sure if I need to switch up my all my products, or if I just need to add an extra step. I have been thinking about trying azelaic acid. (And I know I should be using a sunscreen.)\n\nMy skin is oily, sensitive, and easily irritated. It's hard to find things that don't burn me or overly dry me out. It's become so dry lately that even the thick moisturizing cream doesn't feel like enough.\n\nI know the deep scars need professional intervention. I can live with them for now. I'm wondering if there's more I can do at home for the persistent closed comedones, blackheads, and hyperpigmentation. And I can't tell if the situation on my chin is sebaceous filaments or comedones.\n\nI was prescribed tretinoin in my teens, but it burned my skin really bad even at the lowest percentage. I tolerated retinol better, but had to stop after becoming pregnant and didn't get to see how I tolerated it long term. PanOxyl dried me out so bad. I've tried so many other cleansers and lotions I can't even remember tbh.",
