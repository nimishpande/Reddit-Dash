If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands. As in, the hair will get extremely tangled or will remain damp around the scalp. ",

      "content": "Hello dear curly heads!\n\nI have grown my hair long for about 4 years now and I think it suits me way better than the very short hair I had all the years before. I didn't use conditioner back than, so they were very dry.\n\nBUT: Sometimes it really gets on my nerves. If they are open, they tend to hang in my face. I cannot see anything left and right of me and it is annoying in my opinion. It also is not good in my job (videographer, I have to often change my head position, put on headphones etc.). That's why I have them to a half bun like seen in the pictures most of the time. This was also my main goal a while ago: The Jon Snow style. And I think I wear it pretty well. They are just way too long in the back, right? I also think the top might be too long, because the bun is very big (but that could be because of the curls?). \n\nMy problem is, that I tend to look too female with longer hair. I am thin and also big. With long hair, I often get the feeling of not beeing looked at as a man and that's making me feel uncomfortable (especially with open hair).\n\nMy routine:\n\n\\- Wash 2x per week\n\n\\- I use shampoo 2x (Alverde, a cheap one from DM in Germany without any bad things in it)\n\n\\- Conditioner (also the same company) and brush my hair with it in\n\n\\- Dry it a bit with a t-shirt or microfibre\n\n\\- Put in Aloe Vera leave in conditioner (Herbal Essences)\n\n\\- Put in gel and scrunch (I now have one of Rossmann, Isana)\n\n\\- Dry with a diffusor and I try to keep my hair not in the face but back. I sometimes put in a hair band)\n\n\\- I don't dry it completely because I tend to get frizz that way. So I let it air dry the rest.\n\n\\- I sleep with not fully dry hai and I do not use a satin pillow, but I don't think that makes any big problems here.\n\n\\- Sometimes I make them wet and use a product like leave in in the morning.\n\nSo here comes my question:\n\nDo these long hair suit me better than the short ones? Are they TOO long? Should I just cut those in the back a bit more? \n\nOr should I shorten them even more? \n\nThank you everyone!",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Straighter on the top curler on the underneath. \n\nMy routine-\n\nNormally I just brush my hair before I shower, right now I’ve been using the Monday shampoo and conditioner and at first I really liked it with the first washes but now my hair is starting to feel a bit more dry and I’ve already trimmed my dead ends off once since buying it and I need to trim again. I think I started using it in October. I have a wide tooth comb for wet hair I just bought 2 weeks ago and I normally just wrap my hair up in a towel for a sec, then air dry.\n\nWhat are some good products that you can swear by that don’t damage or weigh down my hair? And any advice on how to get it to have more shine and less friz? Thank you for any suggestions. \n\nThe first photo is my hair after my last recent trim, I style my bangs with a straighter, forgot to mention that above. And the second one is before my trim. I haven’t taken recent photos. But my hair pretty much looks like the second photo rn. Maybe worse honestly ",

In the PM, I follow a short-contact method prescribed by my dermatologist — I apply Aziderm Plus for 1 hour, wash it off, then use only a moisturizer and sleep. I’m trying to keep my routine barrier-friendly. For active acne i use tea tree oil and its working benzoyl peroxide didn’t work for me\n\nWhat can I safely add to help with hyperpigmentation, acne scars, and ongoing acne without damaging my barrier again?\n\nI heard Sugandha advanced serum is good not sure though ",

FYI i pick at my acne pretty compulsively, so most of the redness you’re seeing comes from that.\n\nany tips would be so greatly appreciated, ive had clear skin all my life and this has been so stressful trying to figure out. its taken a real hit to my confidence",

      "content": "I look a bit silly in the photos, but the difference is so clear in the before, and after. The first photo is from September, the last two are taken yesterday For context:\n\nI’ve had hormonal acne for about 15 years (I’m 27 now). Last year, I started getting super frustrated with it and extremely insecure because it has lasted so long. I did two rounds of Accutane, I’ve tried antibiotics, different diets and I have a great skin care routine and nothing worked.\n\nBasically everything would break me out and my acne would get super bad the week before my period and then need the next three weeks to recover when the cycle started again. I also had some other hormone related issues like frequent migraines, and severe cramps during my period as well as heavy bleeding. Unfortunately, when I tried the combined pill, my migraines got super severe so I didn’t consider birth control pills and option until now.\n\nI actually learned about this specific brand of pill from ChatGPT and I don’t like ChatGPT, but I’m so grateful that I used it for research. I asked my doctor and I was prescribed it and have been using it for the last three months., since early October.\n\nMy skin has already improved massively, I only have a few small pimples, and if it stays at the level it currently is, I’m happy with it, but I honestly think it’s gonna get even better. I’m used to waking up with like five new pimples every day so this has been so great. I did have some annoying bleeding for the first two months but that’s slowly going away now. When I’ve had a migraine, it has only been one at a time. Usually my migraines recur over the course of 1-2 weeks so this is also an improvement. oh, I take the pill without break so my hormones are completely stable and I don’t have a period anymore which is amazing!!!!\n\nWhat also helped my skin a liiiiiiittle bit is to take omega-3 supplements daily and 2 to 3 times a week I take a zinc supplement. Also, the cicaplast serum from La Roche Posay has been really helpful.\n\nI’m also getting a nose surgery this year, so hopefully all my insecurities quiet down a bit. Hope this is helpful to some of you xoxo.",

Wondering how well my highlights would translate and if it would look good, and when it begins to fade if it'll look bad or not. I do really like my hair as-is but I think I want to try something new 😭 not sure if there's anything else to consider curl wise but if anyone here has dyed their curly hair before and has some advice or product recommendations, would be much appreciated!\n\nim getting a mean red warning for posting this without including my routine so ill put that here aswell ig.\n\nTRESemme Shampoo / Conditioner, Purple Shampoo once a month. 1st photo no product, 2 photo unsure since it was just whatever my hair dresser used when the photo was taken, but I get similar results with got2b curl spray",

It's right in the middle of my chest and since I'm so pale it looks so prominent. The redness hasn't gone away. \n\nI've been using Cetaphil Acne Relief body wash on it, but since it's not really acne anymore it's probably not helping. It's not really a scar either though so idk. I just try to leave it alone and hope it fades away but it's been 4 months and no change.\n\nHow do I get rid of it? 😭",
