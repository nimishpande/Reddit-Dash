This journey is just one of many that I am doing as part of my goal of being a better stewart of my body. In this post I will focus on Skincare. My current routine is the following:\n\nAM: Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser, Peach Slices Hypochlorous Acid, My iN.gredients Snail Mucin Serum\\*, CeraVe Skin Renewing Eye Cream, CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Lotion.\n\nPM: CeraVe SA Cleanser, Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser, Peach Slices Hypochlorous Acid, My iN.gredients Snail Mucin Serum\\*, CeraVe Skin Renewing Eye Cream, CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion.\n\n\\*I ran out and switched to COSRX.\n\nThe 1st picture is from the beginning of the month and the second is from today. My skin is starting to look better!\n\nI'm thinking of getting La Roche Posay's Cicaplast B5 Spray as I live in Interior Alaska. I am also thinking of getting Peach Slices Azelaic Acid Serum? Or a Toner pad from Kbeauty? Not sure yet. Any advice?",

      "content": "Hello dear curly heads!\n\nI have grown my hair long for about 4 years now and I think it suits me way better than the very short hair I had all the years before. I didn't use conditioner back than, so they were very dry.\n\nBUT: Sometimes it really gets on my nerves. If they are open, they tend to hang in my face. I cannot see anything left and right of me and it is annoying in my opinion. It also is not good in my job (videographer, I have to often change my head position, put on headphones etc.). That's why I have them to a half bun like seen in the pictures most of the time. This was also my main goal a while ago: The Jon Snow style. And I think I wear it pretty well. They are just way too long in the back, right? I also think the top might be too long, because the bun is very big (but that could be because of the curls?). \n\nMy problem is, that I tend to look too female with longer hair. I am thin and also big. With long hair, I often get the feeling of not beeing looked at as a man and that's making me feel uncomfortable (especially with open hair).\n\nMy routine:\n\n\\- Wash 2x per week\n\n\\- I use shampoo 2x (Alverde, a cheap one from DM in Germany without any bad things in it)\n\n\\- Conditioner (also the same company) and brush my hair with it in\n\n\\- Dry it a bit with a t-shirt or microfibre\n\n\\- Put in Aloe Vera leave in conditioner (Herbal Essences)\n\n\\- Put in gel and scrunch (I now have one of Rossmann, Isana)\n\n\\- Dry with a diffusor and I try to keep my hair not in the face but back. I sometimes put in a hair band)\n\n\\- I don't dry it completely because I tend to get frizz that way. So I let it air dry the rest.\n\n\\- I sleep with not fully dry hai and I do not use a satin pillow, but I don't think that makes any big problems here.\n\n\\- Sometimes I make them wet and use a product like leave in in the morning.\n\nSo here comes my question:\n\nDo these long hair suit me better than the short ones? Are they TOO long? Should I just cut those in the back a bit more? \n\nOr should I shorten them even more? \n\nThank you everyone!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hi reddit!\n\nLaura Bailey from Critical Role is my goal in all things. I'm finally starting to leave the house again after years of COVID-induced remote work and social isolation, and I'm trying to level myself up. My hair is a similar length and colored similarly to hers, though I'm not sure how close we are in terms of texture and thickness.\n\nI'm obsessed with the wavy hairstyle in these screenshots (in the light blue/purple sweater). How would I get my hair to look like this? I bought one of those three-barrel wavers, and while it gets close, it's not exactly right, but that might be user error. From wet hair--how do I get her look?\n\nI also like the look in the third picture (flannel shirt). Similarly, how do I get this look? I can curl my hair...but I'm not sure I'm placing the curls right or have the right size curler to get this look. What do you recommend?\n\nAlso, if you're feeling generous--how do I maintain throughout the week? Even if I style one day, I don't know how to keep it up the next day. I often end up straightening (because it's fast and easy) or putting it back in a claw clip.\n\nThank you for helping this clueless Redditor with any hair help!",

The redness hasn't gone away. \n\nI've been using Cetaphil Acne Relief body wash on it, but since it's not really acne anymore it's probably not helping. It's not really a scar either though so idk. I just try to leave it alone and hope it fades away but it's been 4 months and no change.\n\nHow do I get rid of it? 😭",

Im pretty sure taking a pill as soon as I wake up is something I can just do for the rest of my life. \n\nPutting on some sort of foam on my head and rubbing it in twice a day, that is going to be tough to do forever.\n\nSo I guess my question is, should I just start on the finasteride. If it works, then all good. I'll stick with it. If not then I'll look into minoxidil?\n\nIt sounds like finasteride is the drug with the time pressure. That is the earlier you start is better because you want to get to it before your hair follicles die off.\n\nThe minoxidil sounds like it's more cosmetic and you can start and restart that anytime (noting it takes months to work), it won't have any effect long term struggle to do forever.",

Thank you so much in advance! i think i have fine/medium hair, and it absorbs water very quickly. i've been doing this routine to bring my waves back:\n\nShampoo by alama, curl line\n\nconditioner by alama curl line\n\ni used to comb in the shower after the conditioner, but lately i've been brushing it before showering and i've noticed i've been losing a lot less hair compared to when i brushed it in the shower.\n\nAfter the shower i put curl amplifier always by alama, mousse and gel and then scrunch with a cotton shirt, and then plop, i used to plop for a little and then diffuse but lately i've been plopping overnight and it works wonderfully for me. but before i plop overnight I diffuse the roots a lot and do some normal diffusing. then i'll plop and use the hair drier on top without the diffuser until it's dry. i usually do this before dinner so it makes sense to just sleep on the cotton shirt instead of removing the hair and putting it in the bonnet.  \n\nALSO there's one side of my head that does not curl the same and it's a lot more flat, do you think maybe cutting that side more will make them grow more wavy?
