      "content": "Now on the presumably \"tail end\" of my logarithmic reaction to my hair routine. Here's my stack and some commonly asked questions from my updates a quarter ago.\n\nRoutine:\n\n- .3% Finasteride, 6% Minoxidil topical combination. Applied originally via four .25ml sprays. Moved to a dropper bottle at month 4. Applied nightly 6x per week right before bed, have only missed 2 nights total.\n- Dermastamp (microneedle) 1mm once weekly before bed. Temples and scalp. I skip the topical on this night. \n- Keta shampoo, normal concentration, 3 mins on scalp once or twice a week.\n\nOther Considerations people asked about (probably didn't have much of a hair-effect):\n\n- I religiously take a multivitamin, fish oil, magnesium glycinate, and 5g of creatine daily.\n- I lift 4x weekly and play team sports once or twice weekly.\n- I sleep 8.5 hrs per night consistently.\n- I drink socially most weekends. In the back half of my 20s.\n- I am not sponsored, so I will not provide the brand name of the topical. It is safe to assume that it is the largest US men's hair regrowth company.\n- Receded lightly through college then thinned consistently for a year before deciding to do something about it.\n\nI have had zero side effects. None whatsoever. I know that is individual to myself but no need to ask in the comments, I promise I don't miss issues with my body when they arise.\n\nHappy to answer any remaining Qs or take any advice for further temple regrowth!\n",

Right after drainage, it has left behind this pink/red bump since then after it closed/healed. It's stayed the same appearance pretty much, though I think at one point around December it got irritated a bit and enlarged a little but it went back down on its own to what it looks like in the picture now. \n\nI assume the scar tissue left behind can't grow any more hair hence why this hair seems to be stuck in this length? I'm scared to pull it out cause it might invite bacteria in and I really don't want a repeat of what happened last time. \n\nI have an appointment with my PCP who can hopefully refer me to a derm but it won't be for another 2 weeks, so just looking for advice here in the meantime.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

A ponytail would maybe have the circumference of a US quarter? In the summer, I clipped all of it down to 1/4 in and have just let it do its own thing since. Not sure if I need a trip to a salon to tidy up my cut for the best outcome. For my routine, I tend to just use some cheap VO5 shampoo and conditioner about 2/3 times a week. Showers happen daily, but I don't clean my hair every time. For drying, I use a normal towel and let it air out, then brush and comb afterwards. Thank you in advance for any tips! I'm sorry if my hair type doesn't look very curly, but I promise it makes giant full spirals as it gets longer. I just would always straighten it in the past. ",

I was not very aware of how this treatment works so when I noticed very good results (after ≈ 6 months ) I stopped the treatment, thinking my hair were going to stay like that for my entire life (lol). 6 months after, I started losing my hairs again and this time I took oral minoxidil (2,5%) because it was easier. Now it’s been 6 months, and I don’t have huge results. Maybe my hairs falls a bit less than before, but I still notice that I loose density days after days. Has anyone had the same experience ? What would you guys recommend ? I’m thinking of keeping this treatment for another 6 months so I can see his real potential but I’m also very worried. \n\nThanks",
