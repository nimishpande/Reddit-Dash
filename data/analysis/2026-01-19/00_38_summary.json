      "content": "Now on the presumably \"tail end\" of my logarithmic reaction to my hair routine. Here's my stack and some commonly asked questions from my updates a quarter ago.\n\nRoutine:\n\n- .3% Finasteride, 6% Minoxidil topical combination. Applied originally via four .25ml sprays. Moved to a dropper bottle at month 4. Applied nightly 6x per week right before bed, have only missed 2 nights total.\n- Dermastamp (microneedle) 1mm once weekly before bed. Temples and scalp. I skip the topical on this night. \n- Keta shampoo, normal concentration, 3 mins on scalp once or twice a week.\n\nOther Considerations people asked about (probably didn't have much of a hair-effect):\n\n- I religiously take a multivitamin, fish oil, magnesium glycinate, and 5g of creatine daily.\n- I lift 4x weekly and play team sports once or twice weekly.\n- I sleep 8.5 hrs per night consistently.\n- I drink socially most weekends. In the back half of my 20s.\n- I am not sponsored, so I will not provide the brand name of the topical. It is safe to assume that it is the largest US men's hair regrowth company.\n- Receded lightly through college then thinned consistently for a year before deciding to do something about it.\n\nI have had zero side effects. None whatsoever. I know that is individual to myself but no need to ask in the comments, I promise I don't miss issues with my body when they arise.\n\nHappy to answer any remaining Qs or take any advice for further temple regrowth!\n",

To start, I know next to nothing about skincare, and it's always been trial and error for what works and what doesn't. I used to have oily skin, then went on accutane (8 years ago) and now have very dry skin.  I use several products from the CosRX line, but by the end of the day, my skin is scaly and almost painful it's so dry. I'm 27, and I'm starting to notice my skin aging faster than it should. I drink almost a gallon of water a day, and I use the pictured products in that order, with the vitamin E serum being every 2 days.  I do have acne scars, and very sensitive skin. I've tried asking for advice from the Ulta workers, but they always have something they're earning commission on and will recommend that whether it will work for me or not. I had an allergic reaction the last time they recommended me something, so now I'm a little more hesitant to ask for their advice. Any advice is super appreciated!!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

My skin is so very sensitive I had to stop using a razor (I had to switch to an electric one) because I would get severe razor burns for days.\n\nI've heard that retinol can be a bit harsh, and I don't know what to buy to start. I was thinking of the 2% from The Ordinary, but I'm not sure it's the best option. Can someone help me?\n\nAlso, I should use it during my night routine after cleansing but before moisturizing, right?\n\nThanks to everyone who will answer.\n\nIf you need more info, just write the question in a comment.",

I’ve been using Anua foaming cleanser for a while now and have been using beauty of joseon toner and creams but haven’t seen it make a noticeable difference to my skin.\n\nSo lately I switched to Centella and started using their skin1004 range including both the oil and foaming cleanser, toner, ampoule and cream, but again, haven’t seen any difference. If anything, the oil cleanser could be the reason I have had a recent breakout on my chin.\n\nWhat I really need are products that will really work to get rid of my red marks and scarring. That’s what bothers me the most. My skin looks dull and the blemishes are all over the place. This photo was taken a good few weeks ago where my skin wasn’t acting up so bad. At the moment I’m having a bad chin breakout and my skin is dryyyy from winter and artificial heating from my place of work.\n\nCan anyone recommend a good routine that’ll work for me? Thank you :)",

I was not very aware of how this treatment works so when I noticed very good results (after ≈ 6 months ) I stopped the treatment, thinking my hair were going to stay like that for my entire life (lol). 6 months after, I started losing my hairs again and this time I took oral minoxidil (2,5%) because it was easier. Now it’s been 6 months, and I don’t have huge results. Maybe my hairs falls a bit less than before, but I still notice that I loose density days after days. Has anyone had the same experience ? What would you guys recommend ? I’m thinking of keeping this treatment for another 6 months so I can see his real potential but I’m also very worried. \n\nThanks",

A ponytail would maybe have the circumference of a US quarter? In the summer, I clipped all of it down to 1/4 in and have just let it do its own thing since. Not sure if I need a trip to a salon to tidy up my cut for the best outcome. For my routine, I tend to just use some cheap VO5 shampoo and conditioner about 2/3 times a week. Showers happen daily, but I don't clean my hair every time. For drying, I use a normal towel and let it air out, then brush and comb afterwards. Thank you in advance for any tips! I'm sorry if my hair type doesn't look very curly, but I promise it makes giant full spirals as it gets longer. I just would always straighten it in the past. ",

This has been a constant struggle for me despite trying new products (more products vs. less products, creams vs. lotions, mousse vs. gel, liquid oil vs. dry oil etc.), different methods (air drying, diffusing, plopping, scrunch &amp; pulse, shake &amp; rake, prayer hands, you name it), experimenting with protein vs. hydration, and anything else that seems like it might make a difference.\n\nI am really looking to enhance my natural wave pattern without weighing my hair down, but it seems like my hair ends up gritty and greasy, &amp; not “touchably soft” even if I use the smallest amount of product, plop, diffuse, sotc. My waves look awesome for a good 5 minutes after I finish my routine before the weight takes over &amp; makes everything look strung out.\n\nAs far as I can tell, I have 2b, low-porosity hair. I have very thick hair and fine individual strands. My hair is long, reaching my middle-lower back. My scalp isn’t particularly oily, but my ends are dry. I have lots of layers in my hair, and the underneath is thicker/more wiry, while the top layer of my hair gets frizzy &amp; bulks up like crazy.\n\nCurrently my routine looks like:\n\nWash (twice a week):\n\n\\* NYMN Tahitian Gardenia &amp; Mango Butter Curl Defining Shampoo &amp; Conditioner (I cleanse twice &amp; condition once)\n\n\\* Garnier Fructis Pure Clean Shampoo (used once a week to remove product build up)\n\n\\* Amika Hydrorush Hair Mask (used once a week for deep conditioning)\n\nStyle:\n\n\\* Ouidad Moisture Lock Whipped Curls (applied while hair is soaking wet in sections \\*just a little, about a silver dollar’s worth in all!\\*)\n\n\\* Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Heat &amp; Humidity Gel (applied right after while hair is still wet &amp; in sections \\*just a little, about a nickel’s worth for each 1/4 section\\*)\n\n\\* Hover diffuse before regular diffusing\n\n\\* Scrunch out the crunch with OGX Moroccan Argan Oil\n\nI refresh with Bumble &amp; Bumble Curl Refresh mixed with water in a spray bottle, scrunch, diffuse, oil the ends. I also sleep in a satin bonnet overnight.\n\nOut of frustration on my last wash, I only applied the Whipped Curls &amp; STILL my hair feels greasy &amp; dirty. I’m lost.\n\nI feel my biggest challenge is the low porosity part(?) &amp; getting my moisture just right, but honestly I am lost and am open to any and all advice.",
