Long story short, I didn't have the styling for a shaggy cut down for quite some time, as I was used to do a lot for my hair. I think I finally got it down, first picture is before cut, second picture after cut but styling struggles, last one is the final result. Routine, wash and condition with Q+A curl defining shampoo, and conditioner. Styling, Curlshow curlstyle milk, Curlshow multi use styling cream, Curlshow Curl Creator. Refresh, Curlshow curl style mousse. So, I rake the products with my fingers through my hair, scrunch, hover dry with diffuser, cast starts forming, diffuse, cast gets a little harder, start scrunching it out. Diffuse, hair dries more, cast start forming again, scrunch it out. I repeat this until it's as good as 95% dry. Little bit of black castor oil, rub it in the palm of my hands, apply to hair using praying hands method. ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

The brief reportedly asked them to make it look “organic” while targeting certain brands.\n\nHonestly, it’s getting hard to know which Indian sunscreen brands to trust anymore — should we just pay the premium and stick to Korean or Western ones?\n\nFeels super misleading to the audience.\nStory credits: @riaspeaks\n\n(Screenshots attached)\n",

Got highlights for the first time right before turning 17 to get rid of the ”red/orange” color that wouldnt leave my hair after dyeing it very dark brown. HATED the blonde, felt super washed out. \n\nLater on started liking to then loving the blonde and continued to highlight it once a year. My hair is super fine and pretty thin I’d say. The blonde made my hair less greasy, it however got pretty dry and started tangling like crazy, I also haven’t been able to grow it out due to it breaking from being dry etcetc. \n\nSo I thought that I’d get lowlights to match my natural haircolor. The the lowlights ended up making me feel and look gray. So I hated it, went back to blonde like 6 months later and then now I’m currently light brown with a bit of more warmth to it. And it’s way better than last time, but I honestly can’t stop thinking and looking at the blonde. At the same time people keep saying that your natural hair color always looks the best blah blah blah, but my natural literally makes me look gray, GRAY. \n\nSo please gaslight me however much needed into being okay with the darker color I have currently even though it’s more orange than my natural. Because I’m trying SO hard not to bleach damage my hair any more but it’s so hard when it looks SO goood.😭🙏\n\nFirst pictures is my current, middle is my natural/the lowlights and the blonde (my true love) at the end.\n\nAnd please don’t make any comments besides my hair, I’m a sensitive soul🥹🙏\n",

My arms and upper body are much darker compared to my legs and inner areas. It is starting to make me feel insecure, especially because I want to start a fitness Instagram page, but this uneven skin tone is holding me back.\n\nI cannot visit a dermatologist right now. To be honest, I have never done any skincare before. I have only ever used a simple soap. No face wash, no sunscreen, nothing. I know it is my fault for being ignorant and not taking care earlier, but I am ready to learn and stay consistent now.\n\nI am not expecting overnight results. I am not looking for how to get \"fair\", I just want to get my original skin tone back. I am okay with working on my skin for months or even years if needed. I just want to start properly and stay committed.\n\nPlease help me with:\n\n- A beginner skincare routine (AM and PM) that actually works to reduce tanning and even out skin tone\n\n- I need help with getting rid of tan from both face and upper body\n\n- What ingredients or habits to avoid\n\n-What helped you personally reduce tanning and regain your natural tone \n\n(Excuse me if the picture is inappropriate. I just wanted to clearly show the contrast I am referring to. Hope that is okay.) \n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

Every reel or post I see is advertising a different product, and somehow everything seems to work for everyone else.\n\nRight now, my skincare routine is pretty simple: \n\n• Cleanser: CeraVe face wash \n\n• Moisturiser: Simple moisturiser \n\n• Sunscreen: Shiseido \n\n• Serum (sometimes): Niacinamide + Zinc from Superdrug\n\nRecently, I’ve noticed my skin feels more textured and I have some hyperpigmentation. I also have leftover red acne scars on my cheeks from past breakouts. I thought about shopping for new skincare, but every time I try, I get overwhelmed by the options. I read tons of reviews, scroll Reddit, and end up not buying anything because I don’t want to waste money on something that might not work.\n\nI’ll admit I’m not the most consistent person with my routine, so that might be part of the issue too.\n\nSo, I guess my questions are: \n\n• How do you decide what to buy when there are so many choices? \n\n• Are there any products or ingredients you’d recommend for texture and acne scarring/hyperpigmentation (especially for someone with sensitive skin)?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice from people who’ve been in the same spot.\n\nThanks!",

When I first started getting cystic acne, I saw an esthetician for a year and tried just about everything: mandelic acid, vitamin A, vitamin C, chemical peels, etc. Unfortunately, nothing helped - most treatments made my skin worse.\n\nEventually, I decided to see a dermatologist. We first tried spironolactone, but I experienced unpleasant side effects. My dermatologist then prescribed Clindamycin, Winlevi, and Tretinoin 0.025%, and that combination worked beautifully. My skin was completely clear for about a year and a half.\n\nHowever, around six months ago, the cystic acne started to return. I had stopped using Clindamycin and Winlevi for a while and was only using Tretinoin. I’ve since increased my Tretinoin to 0.05% and restarted Winlevi, but I’m noticing raised acne again. I’m wondering if the flare-up could be due to the higher Tretinoin concentration bringing more sebum to the surface.\n\nI’m not currently using any other actives, should I be? I’d really appreciate any advice or recommendations.",

It is starting to make me feel insecure, especially because I want to start a fitness Instagram page, but this uneven skin tone is holding me back.\n\nI cannot visit a dermatologist right now. To be honest, I have never done any skincare before. I have only ever used a simple soap. No face wash, no sunscreen, nothing. I know it is my fault for being ignorant and not taking care earlier, but I am ready to learn and stay consistent now.\n\nI am not expecting overnight results. I just want to get my original skin tone back. I am okay with working on my skin for months or even years if needed. I just want to start properly and stay committed.\n\nPlease help me with:\n\n- A beginner skincare routine (AM and PM) that actually works to reduce tanning and even out skin tone\n\n- I need help with getting rid of tan from both face and upper body\n\n- What ingredients or habits to avoid\n\n-What helped you personally reduce tanning and regain your natural tone \n\n(Excuse me if the picture is inappropriate.

      "content": "Hi!! I need some help with a good styling routine for my hair. I find that I just can't keep the waves through out the day, as they tend to fall easily.\n\nI have fine and thin hair. I'm pretty sure my hair is high porosity because it absorbs water quickly but also dries quickly. My hair really loved humid days!!\n\nI've also had a history of bleaching my hair, but I have been bleach free for almost 2 years now, and have only done bleach-free hair dyes.\n\nI'd like to establish a good routine the fits my wash schedule. Because my hair is so fine, my hair looks oily really easily, so it weighs down my roots really easily and just makes me look like a mess. \n\nMy normal wash routine is to wash every other day unless:\n- i need to go out and my oily roots are not presentable\n- post-gym session\n\nI only wash my hair during the day/morning, because I find I sweat a lot at night and my roots end up looking oily and weight down the next morning. I have tried training my scalp before, but ultimately, it never helped significantly and my hair also got smelly (not sure if high porosity makes it easier at picking up scents...) I'm also naturally a super sweaty gal so my roots get gross quickly. Updos can only hide my oily roots so much, and I find I feel more hot and sweaty if my second day hair is significantly more oily than usual. Not sure how to describe it, but essentially if I'm on my second day hair and it looks decent before I go out, I find I feel more sweaty and hot at my roots and end up looking super greasy while I am out. I've even had some embarrassing comments asking if my hair is still wet from my shower... which just shows how bad my hair and roots look even on the second day.... \n\nMy current hair routine is:\n- shampoo with gentle cleanser (double shampoo sometimes too stripping, and moisturizing shampoo sometimes too heavy)\n- squish and detangle with moisturizing conditioner \n- squish to wring out water\n- apply curl cream and squish waves\n- towel dry with squish method\n- dry with wide tooth comb attachment (occasionally diffuser but it causes more frizz)\n- finish with lightweight oil to seal cuticles \n\nI try to keep my routine a bit simple since I have to wash my hair more often. But would love some suggestions on a different routine that may hold my waves better. Affordable product recommendations would be greatly appreciated as well.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n(fyi tried to post on r/wavyhair but couldn't get it to post - sorry my hair isn't really curly!)",

The rest of my face has improved a lot, but this part stays the same.\n\nI actually had the same bumps when I first hit puberty, and now I’m 20 and they’ve been back for about 1.5–2 years.\n\nMy routine right now:\n\t•\tMakeup remover (if I wear makeup): Micellar water with a bit of oil\n\t•\tCleanser: Biodermal Sensitive Micellar Cleansing Gel (I use this after the micellar water)\n\t•\tMoisturizer: The Ordinary Hydrating HA Cream (no oils or actives — I apply it on slightly damp skin)\n\t•\tExfoliant: Salicylic acid exfoliator from Paula’s Choice, about once a week\n\nMy skin is usually normal, but around my period or when the weather changes it can get a bit oilier on my nose and forehead.\nI’m also autistic, so I prefer keeping my routine really simple — no long routines or multiple serums.\nAnd just in case it’s relevant: I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis about a year ago, so I’m wondering if that could play a role too.\n\nDoes anyone know what could cause this or how to deal with it without adding too many products? Could it be clogged pores, fungal acne, or something else?",

I know that the easiest way is to just slug overnight and wake up hydrated, but this usually STILL doesn't leave me hydrated enough to prevent a whole bunch of seperation/texture issues with my foundation. And sealing my hydration with a good occlusive in the morning DOES make my foundation glide on beautifully, but I am super duper greasy just an hour later, and nothing ends up lasting.\n\nI've been told that I can just skip the occlusive layer altogether, and just use a few layers of humectants, but wouldn't that make everything evaporate and end up being a huge waste of time and money?\n\nAnyway, super sorry for the crap formatting (I'm on my phone) and if this is hard to read, thank you in advance everyone! :D",
