Long story short, I didn't have the styling for a shaggy cut down for quite some time, as I was used to do a lot for my hair. I think I finally got it down, first picture is before cut, second picture after cut but styling struggles, last one is the final result. Routine, wash and condition with Q+A curl defining shampoo, and conditioner. Styling, Curlshow curlstyle milk, Curlshow multi use styling cream, Curlshow Curl Creator. Refresh, Curlshow curl style mousse. So, I rake the products with my fingers through my hair, scrunch, hover dry with diffuser, cast starts forming, diffuse, cast gets a little harder, start scrunching it out. Diffuse, hair dries more, cast start forming again, scrunch it out. I repeat this until it's as good as 95% dry. Little bit of black castor oil, rub it in the palm of my hands, apply to hair using praying hands method. ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

      "content": "Tbh I think I’m cooked and the only way to get rid of these is probably botox but I do want to work on preventing them from getting anymore obvious since I’m still pretty young. \n\nI suspect this could be mostly sun damage (my left side is much more advanced than the right side- driver side window may be the culprit) but I am very expressive and don’t have prominent facial structure features to balance out the movement- slim jaw, small cheekbones. \n\nI’ve been working outdoors for the past 3.5 years and only started wearing sunscreen daily for the past 1.5 years. I’ve been wearing sunglasses daily for the past 1.5 years - I lagged because I require prescription lenses. When I work I usually have a baseball cap on. I drink a minimum of 2L of water during the day and even more at night. I hardly drink alcohol, don’t smoke cigarettes but do smoke weed. I take a few daily medications- the only one that might have a negative impact is Seroquel, which I take to help with nasty dreams. I have a go to moisturizer but have been pretty meager with it because keeping my skin more on the dry side has kept my acne manageable but I’m now realizing that may have contributed to the lines. \n\nIn the past year my go-to routine has mostly been:\n\nAM\nCeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser \nStridex pads (red box) - all over face \nNeutrogena Clear Face serum sunscreen SPF 60+  \n\nPM \nCeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser \nStridex pads (red box) - all over face \nHumanrace humidifying cream \n\nNow that I’m panicking over aging I’ve been researching and buying new products to build a new routine. So far I have:\n\nAM\nCeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser\nStridex pads (red box) - spot treatment, away from eyes \nThe Ordinary Multi-Peptide + Hyaluronic Acid\nCOSRX Snail Mucin Peptide Under Eye Cream\nHumanrace humidifying cream \nNeutrogena Clear Face serum sunscreen SPF 60+ - if I’m going outside OR\nAquaphor slugging around eyes if I’m staying inside\n\nPM\nCeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser\nStridex pads (red box) - spot treatment, away from eyes \nThe Ordinary Multi-Peptide + Hyaluronic Acid\nThe Ordinary Retinol 0.2% in Squalane (only tried once 2 nights ago, my face isn’t too dry so I’m going to apply again tonight) \nCOSRX Snail Mucin Peptide Under Eye Cream (not sure if this should go before or after retinol)\nHumanrace humidifying cream \nAquaphor slugging around eyes\n\nI’m brand new to retinol so I chose what seems to be a relatively gentle option. From research it sounds like I’ll have to work up to tretinoin to make any kind of difference. I haven’t gone to a dermatologist since high school and health insurance has been inconsistent as of lately so I’m not sure how soon I can get in. So any and all advice/suggestions/recommendations would be much appreciated!\n\n\n\n\n",

I started retinol to help with this.\n\nI had been using the CeraVe retinol for around 3 months, then swapped to the KSecret Seoul 1988 Retinal face serum and eye cream roughly 2 weeks ago.\n\nMy skin looks mostly clear of everything now except my wrinkles seem to have gotten worse, and my forehead bumps look to have basically stayed the same.\n\nMy current skincare routine is as follows;\n\nMorning:\n- Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil OR Dr Althea Pore Refresh Cleansing Balm\n- Shiseido Senka Perfect Whip Collagen Face Wash\n- EQQUALBERRY Swimming Pool Toner\n- EQQUALBERRY Vitamin Illuminating Serum\n- Weleda Skin Food Light\n- BOJ Sunscreen\n\nNight: \n- Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil OR Dr Althea Pore Refresh Cleansing Balm\n- Shiseido Senka Perfect Whip Collagen Face Wash\n- VT Reedleshot 100\n- EQQUALBERRY Swimming Pool Toner\n- KSecret Seoul 1988 Retinal Face Serum\n- EQQUALBERRY Bakuchiol Plumping Serum\n- VT PDRN Essence\n- Weleda Skin Food (regular)\n- KSecret Seoul 1988 Retinal Eye Cream\n\nIs this too many products? Am I using them in the wrong order? How long does it take for retinal to work? My skin never purged on the retinal it just feels like I can see my wrinkles more now.\n\nCould I skip the double cleanse in the morning?

My hope is to push for ample skin turn over and possible fullness and tightening of skin to avoid wrinkles. I'd like to also avoid the sagging and leather texture that occurs with Asian skin as we get older, so any further recommendations, serums, or treatments would be welcome. Also being a male, I tend to forget and miss self care also skin care quite often. I really miss the fullness/plumpness of my skin in my younger years and if there is a product that can help with that, do share.\n\nBelow are the products below that I've researched against in this group and in [r/SkincareAddiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/) [r/Skincare\\_Addiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/Skincare_Addiction/) , but unsure of the application of all on a schedule. I wasn't too sure of the Seoul 1988 items and use case one over the other so I purchased both.\n\nI somewhat recall Glycolic Acid if tolerated 1-2 times a week after face wash and before bed. Hyaluronic Acid daily to moisturize? Do I layer Hyaluronic Acid then Retinal Liposome 2% over it daily? Will I need a face creme or lotion on to top of this? Do I need to avoid the sun?\n\n1. The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner\n2. The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5\n3. Seoul 1988 Creme: Retinal Liposome 1% + Fermented Rice\n4. Seoul 1988 Serum: Retinal Liposome 2% + Black Ginseng\n\nThanks!",

I have radically different skin (rosacea, sensitive skin) than my partner and I’m just trying to help ‘em. \n\nMy partner is a black AMAB who normally has flawless skin with zero skincare routine (go figure lol), has trouble breaking out when they use regular razors, to the point where they’ve had cysts at least twice. Electric razors *usually* do not cause break outs, but two weeks ago they went to visit their uncle and tried out his new electric razor and wound up breaking out. Honestly, I think it’s just bc they shared razors with their uncle… The bumps/breakout seemed to either lessen or were just covered up by new beard growth, but a few days ago my partner shaved again with a new razor that was exactly like their uncle’s and broke out again. Maybe it’s just the razor or maybe it’s leftover from when they shaved previously? Either way, when they pointed it out to me yesterday evening, I had them clean their face with my cleanser since it’s paraben and sulfate free and made for sensitive skin, but I haven’t yet done anything else since I don’t want to agitate their skin further. They say the bumps are itchy and I think it could be an allergic reaction to the new razor, but I’m unsure.\n\nIs there anything we can do to lessen the razor bumps/break outs aside from obviously never sharing razors again and keeping their face and current electric razor clean?",

Basically either side of my cheek (close to the jaw) has a red patch/area that just doesn’t go away. It’s mostly flat but the redness on my right cheek has a bit of texture. I notice it gets more red after a shower or washing my face then the following morning it fades a bit. I noticed it gradually developing more red into a patch that covered more area on my cheek over the months. At the moment it doesn’t seem like it’s getting worse but it just won’t go away. Keep in mind my face was perfectly fine before this with only the occasional pimple here and there. Only used la roche posay cleanser and a gentle non-comedogenic moisturizer. I’ve tried many different skincare routine the past few months but nothing is clearing it up. Any ideas what this is? Also product recommendations would help a bunch too. I just want this to fade away. I’ve added pics of how it looks + pictures of what my face looked prior. Any insights are much appreciated!",

The spots are small, red, and mostly around my mouth and jawline area. I think it might be from stress or maybe hormones, but I’m not totally sure. I used to use PanOxyl 10% for body acne a long time ago, but since my face is more sensitive, I’m thinking about using the 4% Creamy Wash instead. I’m just nervous because I don’t want to make it worse. Has anyone else dealt with this kind of breakout, and did the 4% PanOxyl actually help? Any advice or product tips for healing this area gently would mean a lot. Pls help asap. \n",

If I try to build the product, I end up with clashes on the bottom and spiders on the top.\n\nOn the other hand, I have a similar problem with my curler. It's very hard to curl all the lashes at once with the inner and outer corners. Should I buy a smaller one like Shiseido 215 or similar ones?\n\nWhat do you think?
