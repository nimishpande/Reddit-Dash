Long story short, I didn't have the styling for a shaggy cut down for quite some time, as I was used to do a lot for my hair. I think I finally got it down, first picture is before cut, second picture after cut but styling struggles, last one is the final result. Routine, wash and condition with Q+A curl defining shampoo, and conditioner. Styling, Curlshow curlstyle milk, Curlshow multi use styling cream, Curlshow Curl Creator. Refresh, Curlshow curl style mousse. So, I rake the products with my fingers through my hair, scrunch, hover dry with diffuser, cast starts forming, diffuse, cast gets a little harder, start scrunching it out. Diffuse, hair dries more, cast start forming again, scrunch it out. I repeat this until it's as good as 95% dry. Little bit of black castor oil, rub it in the palm of my hands, apply to hair using praying hands method. ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

My arms and upper body are much darker compared to my legs and inner areas. It is starting to make me feel insecure, especially because I want to start a fitness Instagram page, but this uneven skin tone is holding me back.\n\nI cannot visit a dermatologist right now. To be honest, I have never done any skincare before. I have only ever used a simple soap. No face wash, no sunscreen, nothing. I know it is my fault for being ignorant and not taking care earlier, but I am ready to learn and stay consistent now.\n\nI am not expecting overnight results. I am not looking for how to get \"fair\", I just want to get my original skin tone back. I am okay with working on my skin for months or even years if needed. I just want to start properly and stay committed.\n\nPlease help me with:\n\n- A beginner skincare routine (AM and PM) that actually works to reduce tanning and even out skin tone\n\n- I need help with getting rid of tan from both face and upper body\n\n- What ingredients or habits to avoid\n\n-What helped you personally reduce tanning and regain your natural tone \n\n(Excuse me if the picture is inappropriate.

      "content": "Hello! For the past few years I have had shoulder length curls (cannot describe them to you very well, but perhaps 3b?) but only in the past one have I begun to take good care of them. I am still very disappointed with my routine, though, so I would appreciate your advice on what I should do to improve it. \n\nTo start, I wash my hair twice a week, and only then will I touch my hair at all.\nIn the shower...\n&gt;I rinse my hair, then shampoo it (Dove intensive repair). \n&gt;I rinse it again, then condition it (Suave keratin infused smoothing conditioner, though I have used VO5 and Dove historically). \n&gt;I comb it through, then wait a few minutes before rinsing it again. \n\nOnce out of the shower...\n&gt; I ensure my hair is fairly wet before applying both a leave in conditioner (Cantu shea butter) and a curl keeper spray (literally just Curl Keeper Spray Gel). \n&gt;I comb the products above through my hair, first with my actual comb, then with my fingers (I now try to go strand by strand these days.), before scrunching up the strands. \n&gt;Sometimes, I rough up my hair a bit, but not always. \n\nThe results of the above are generally quite good; my hair after the roots is strandy, until the ends, where it coils a bit. Most of the volume is around or below my ears (which is where I want it to be), and overall it looks very healthy. \n\nThis hardly lasts a day, though; I often wear a loc cap, but even then my hair degrades into a dry, messy, mass of nonsense very quickly. Most of it is just frizz at that point, aside from a few strands and coils which look odd next to it. I think the climate I live in (tropical; hot and humid) contributes to that, but I must be doing many other things wrong for it to lose its appearance so rapidly. \n\nHenceforth, I am asking for your assistance on improving my routine. I obviously asked my mum and sister, but I do not completely trust anyone's advice, and prefer opinions from as wide as range of people as possible.\n\nA few things to note:\n&gt;I thought about styling it in the morning with water and conditioner, but I worry about both a buildup of conditioner, and hygral fatigue. Unless it is safe for me to do otherwise, I will only do this on some occasions. \n&gt;Until recently, I have chickened out and used warm to hot water in my hair. Now , I am trying to use lukewarm water instead.\n&gt;I plan to get a trim soon (last was 3 months ago), which should hopefully both help me reduce the amount of dry and damaged hair I have at present, and also get me advice from someone who does this sort of thing for a living. \n&gt;I will replace the loc cap with a bonnet, which should hopefully not be as tight on my hair. \n",

My arms and upper body are much darker compared to my legs and inner areas. It is starting to make me feel insecure, especially because I want to start a fitness Instagram page, but this uneven skin tone is holding me back.\n\nI cannot visit a dermatologist right now. To be honest, I have never done any skincare before. I have only ever used a simple soap. No face wash, no sunscreen, nothing. I know it is my fault for being ignorant and not taking care earlier, but I am ready to learn and stay consistent now.\n\nI am not expecting overnight results. I just want to get my original skin tone back. I am okay with working on my skin for months or even years if needed. I just want to start properly and stay committed.\n\nPlease help me with:\n\n- A beginner skincare routine (AM and PM) that actually works to reduce tanning and even out skin tone\n\n- I need help with getting rid of tan from both face and upper body\n\n- What ingredients or habits to avoid\n\n-What helped you personally reduce tanning and regain your natural tone \n\n(Excuse me if the picture is inappropriate. I just wanted to clearly show the contrast I am referring to. Hope that is okay.) \n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

Now the question is about how I should do it on the rest of my head, i have long hair and I was wondering if I should increase the depth of the needles. Another question is regarding passes and strenght. is it better to do just a few presses where i apply more strenght or is it better to do multiple (like 10/20 +) smaller presses? or is there like a set amount of time i should dedicate to each area. \nApologies for the many questions, also I think i will do it once every two weeks. if you got tips on the frequency as well let me know \n\n",

I also don't know how to make the styling last because my hair gets messy after sleeping and I always just brush it. My waves are still there after brushing it but they're less defined. Anyway, I used the OGX curl shampoo and conditioner, towel dried until damp, and then scrunched in curl cream. \n\nRoutine: \n\n1. Wash with OGX curl quenching shampoo and conditioner\n2. Towel dry until damp\n3. Scrunch in OGX curl quenching curl cream\n4. Air dry\n\nLast time, I diffused it and didnt like how it looked. This time, I air dried it and I think my waves look a lot more defined. Advice on how to make my waves last would be helpful. My hair gets messy overnight so I usually brush it out in the morning. I don't have satin or silk pillowcases or a silk bonnet so I just sleep on a cotton pillowcase. ",
