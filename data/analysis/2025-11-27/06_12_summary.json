      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "Hey! So i was balding pretty intensely and noticed it got really bad sometime around early 2025. After looking and getting over the fear mongering surrounding taking finasteride, i decided to pull the trigger and go with the first option that i saw, which was Hims topical fin+min. I started on August 27th, 2025 (first and second photo) and i am three months in! (third and fourth photo)\n\nDosage: Fin .3% Min 7% Ketoconazol 2.2% Biotin .2%\n\nApplied once a day to both sides of hairline, Top of head, and crown at night\n\nAlso wear a bonnet to sleep as i have a pet dog\n\nHere are a few things i’ve noticed both good and bad and what i wish i would’ve done differently\n\n• What would I have done differently?\n\nI would have started sooner. Although the progress is amazing and i’m really hopeful that most if not all of my past hairline will come back, i know that if i would’ve started this treatment sooner, i would’ve been able to go out in public without a hat. So if you’re noticing any type or hint of balding, don’t wait!!\n\nbe proactive, not reactive.\n\nIf your having to ask people if they think your balding, just assume you are and start treatment early.\n\n• Cons of treatment\n\nDefinitely the price for me. Although Hims is great and it def working, i do feel like there are some cheaper options out there. do your research and find the best option for you price wise\n\nChoosing topical products over oral. To me, it wasn’t worth the risk of ED as my “little man” works out pretty often…if yk what i mean. With that, studies show that topical has less of a chance to have adverse side effects compared to oral, although i have seen that oral does have a bigger chance to work at a higher rate. Not saying topical won’t work, it just might take longer.\n\nBrain fog like a MF. While taking topical fin+min, i started getting mad brain fog around week 5 of usage. Although it’s only usually in the mornings, it does hinder my ability to wake up and get ready for college, and usually lasts a good while. a great work around for this i found is just staying active. go gym, go run, and eat healthy!\n\n• Pros\n\nYOU GET YOUR HAIR BACK!\n\nI will be honest, it’s not coming in as fast as i hoped, but there is an amazing deal of growth here.\n\nin all, this is a journey and i’m very hopeful and excited to get my old head of hair back! If your questioning if instead is safe for you, take the leap. if your worried about ED being caused from finasteride, that’s okay and it’s smart your doing your research, that’s the whole reason i chose topical treatment instead of oral. Which ever you choose, just be proactive about it!",

My skin is also very sensitive and reactive, I've gone through IPL and Microneedling with Purasomes, but honestly I don't see any improvement in my skin at all.\n\nI'm trying to support my skin barrier and reduce inflammation, been looking into LED masks a lot and got quite a bit overwhelmed due to how many options are available.  \n(as for skincare, I truly went through everything possible, prescribed and non-prescribed, I also struggle with PCOS)\n\nI know LED won't really cure acne, but I really need something supportive for my skin because I'm exhausted from dealing with constant breakouts and irritation.

      "title": "MAELYS - A SCAM COMPANY",
      "content": "I want to share my recent experience with Maelys Cosmetics **(A SCAM COMPANY)** in hopes this will help someone avoid the headaches I went through. I’ve documented and saved screenshots/receipts from almost every interaction I had with them, and I’ll be including them in this post.\n\nA couple months ago, I kept seeing Maelys ads on Instagram. They pushed their products along with a **Try Before You Buy (TBYB)** program. I had seen this brand sold at Ulta, which made it feel more legitimate to me, I assumed a retailer as large as Ulta would thoroughly vet the brands they carry, or at least ensure they weren't operating with deceptive or predatory practices.\n\nEven so, I was still a little skeptical being this was my first try before you buy experience and kept a second eye out throughout the checkout process. I read every line of fine print and it seemed to all look good. The only things I knowingly agreed to was:\n\n* Pay shipping upfront\n* Trying the product for 3 weeks - starting from the delivery date of the product\n* I could return it within the 3 week trial window if I didn’t like it to avoid being charged\n* If I didn’t return it, then I would pay for the product\n\n**What actually happened: they refused to honor the trial period AND tried forcing a subscription on me that I never consented to. Here is the timeline of how things went down.**\n\n**7/2 (PIC #3)** **—** Ordered the B-Tight TBYB product. Paid $6.47 (shipping + tax)\n\n**7/10 —** TBYB product delivered. 3-week trial period starts\n\n**7/30 —** I was very consistent with applying the product for weeks but unfortunately saw no results. Last day of my 3-week trial, I reached out via their return chat to initiate a return. **No response from them**\n\n**7/31 —** I contacted them again the next day. This time they responded but said I “missed the window.” I honestly blamed myself for not reaching out a day or two earlier before the last day window(7/30) so I was okay with paying for TBYB products and accepted the charge of $43\n\n**8/2 —** I suddenly receive an order confirmation for $49.47 for ***a subscription.*** **I was extremely confused**\n\n**8/2 (PIC #4) —** I immediately go to their website and contact their chat. They tell me, ***“Your initial TBYB trial converted into a subscription as designed.”*** **This was never disclosed anywhere during checkout process.** They said they’ll cancel my subscription, I assumed they would cancel/not ship out the subscription that just got confirmed earlier in the day and stop any further charges\n\n**8/4 —** I receive an email that the subscription has been shipped\n\n**8/4 (PIC #5) —** Frustrated and fed up with this bs, I file a BBB complaint with screenshots of my checkout process and question why they can start a subscription service on my account without ever disclosing it. This is also when I realize **there are thousands of similar complaints like mine on the** [**BBB site**](https://www.bbb.org/us/ny/staten-island/profile/skin-care/maelys-cosmetics-usa-inc-0121-87147134/complaints?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=PMAX+Startnow+20&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=6830342630&amp;hsa_cam=23267566799&amp;hsa_grp=&amp;hsa_ad=&amp;hsa_src=x&amp;hsa_tgt=&amp;hsa_kw=&amp;hsa_mt=&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23262540642&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADmhR62vzHEqMQ2_5reT6o8ahMOnm&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA55rJBhByEiwAFkY1QL6ZeIIkh2HTpky4KGNa6e8stlhHLtpgFHJV1mYiq1dygiN-9C8GRhoCSNUQAvD_BwE) against this company. It's disgusting D:\n\n**8/5 (PIC #6) —** Maleys responds through the BBB complaint and basically repeats what their customer service chat had previously relayed **“subscription started upon checkout of your TBYB order. It has now been cancelled.”** **They ignore the lack of disclosure/consent.** (They mention my order was placed 8/25, when it was only 8/5.. I think they just copy and pasted a template without ever looking into my order.)\n\n**8/5 (PIC #7) —** I go to their website and reach out to their customer service again and try to arrange a return for the subscription they shipped out. They said they’d email me. **I don't get a email**\n\n**8/7 —** Subscription product is delivered\n\n**8/8 (PIC #8) —** I contact chat again. They think I’m trying to return the TBYB product. I clarify it’s the subscription I never signed up for, but they only say my subscription is canceled going forward. **They close the chat** and refuse to address returning the unwanted subscription package\n\n**8/8 (PIC #9) —** I update my BBB complaint as “not resolved.” They said I missed the TBYB window – fine, I’ll take that (technically they never responded to me the first time I reached out to initiate the return, which caused me to miss the window). But I’m not paying for the subscription, nor do I want the products that I never consented to. I again ask them to show where on throughout the checkout process it states the subscription will start upon checkout of TBYB order\n\n**8/8 —** I dispute the $49.47 charge with my credit card company\n\n**8/12 (PIC #10) —** Maelys responds through the BBB complaint and says they have emailed me a return label (I'm assuming this is because the dispute hit their end, otherwise they would probably just brush me off again)\n\n**8/21 —** I ship back the subscription package (never opened)\n\n**8/27 —** USPS tracking shows it delivered\n\n**8/29 —** I receive a refund of **$43.57** from Maelys — **$5.90 less** than what I paid for the subscription. **They essentially tried charging me for the shipping label** for a product I did not order, did not want, and only received because they refused to cancel the shipment. Again, I dispute this amount with my credit card company and ask them to block all future attempted charges from Maelys\n\n[#1 - Maelys Charges](https://preview.redd.it/maux3rwsxp3g1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f3f2a70c0e7ca7b38196afe9172e7ed1494934e)\n\n[#2 - Maelys Emails](https://preview.redd.it/zll1plypsp3g1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=748492fa987b57cf23f29a222061b2d2260f07db)\n\n[#3 - 7\\/2 Maelys Checkout Process](https://preview.redd.it/3tu7b270tp3g1.jpg?width=3451&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=787b5890a00e8b9d9592c8d8c730e808aaacae4c)\n\n[#4 - 8\\/2 Convo with Maelys Customer Support](https://preview.redd.it/rrik7u89tp3g1.jpg?width=4590&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d721e8d95aeaa512c8b572868088bb329334ae02)\n\n[#5- 8\\/4 Filed BBB Complaint](https://preview.redd.it/gdi2sv49up3g1.jpg?width=2464&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e21b9274867452c1403f572f85593a781a7d4e0d)\n\n[#6 - 8\\/5 Maely's Initial Reponse to BBB Complaint](https://preview.redd.it/ze5zgi1hup3g1.jpg?width=2466&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2878f7915e8baeb7a1a240e1a5802ff721d36509)\n\n[#7 - 8\\/5 Convo with Maelys Customer Support](https://preview.redd.it/ecjzl8jnup3g1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e2a9dec0dae2171eddedcfc047fbf8d00229245)\n\n[#8 - 8\\/8 Convo with Maelys Customer Support](https://preview.redd.it/u3sb4ec5vp3g1.jpg?width=4590&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98bcb7a9daacd04e068b3acf3b93cc30eb08ef8c)\n\n[#9 - 8\\/8 Updated BBB Complaint](https://preview.redd.it/lcthz4vcvp3g1.jpg?width=2462&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67d820717ce4aab98c6e7586acbb35047695c546)\n\n[#10 - 8\\/12 Maely's 2nd Reponse to BBB Complaint](https://preview.redd.it/5dxrmezgvp3g1.jpg?width=2468&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c47feb87e5028e6f82a1c7ea9894477d66a1c19)",

But I am not sure how to get the super tight under coils to relax. I lose so much length!\n\nRoutine\nWash: Curlsmith Curl Detox and Curlsmith Double Cream\nDeep Quencher - leaving in maybe 1TSP on the ends\n\nStyle: Kerastase Chroma Absolu Frizz, Curlsmith Protein Cream.\n\nBrush through. Curlsmith Hydro Flexi Gelly- lots. Begin finger coiling front pieces some, and tryijg to encourage lift / no part on center by finger coiling some here as well. AG Mousse to Roots.\n\nTechnique: I use a diffusing hair dryer to focus on roots, especially top. I find if I can get a good cast on the top/ center it's less frizzy.\n\nI am noticing by the end of the day my hair feels SUPER dry. I am curious if it’s time to cut the protein cream out. It used to be my game changer!\n\nThank you for any help 🤍",

      "content": "Hi everyone! I’d like to share a mobile app I’ve been building focused on sun care and skincare, and I thought it might be useful to some of you.\n\nI’ve always liked taking care of my skin and wearing sunscreen (even if I’m a guy haha), but I didn’t know you’re supposed to reapply it a few times throughout the day. Once I learned that, I went looking for an app to help me remember my sunscreen applications… and found nothing that really fit that need. So I solved it by using iOS Reminders for a few months, which worked, but I wanted something a bit more complete. That’s when I started making some simple prototypes until I finally landed on something that actually worked for me — and that’s how “Sefone — Sunscreen Protection and Skincare App” was born.\n\nI originally built the app for myself so I wouldn’t forget to reapply sunscreen, and to keep track of my products, my mood, and how different weather conditions affect me. I shared it with my family, then with friends, and they loved it — which is why I’d now like to share it with all of you as well. It’s not available on the App Store just yet, but Sefone is in its final development stage while I polish a few things to make it ready for everyone. It’s completely free (No ads, No monthly subscriptions). I built it to be genuinely useful for me, and I really hope it can be useful for you too.\n\nThe app is currently in its Beta version. If you’d like to participate and try it out (please do!), I’d really appreciate it — your feedback and comments would help a lot in fixing potential issues and shaping future improvements.\n\nIf you’re interested in testing the app, feel free to leave a comment and I’ll send you the Apple TestFlight invitation link so you can download it.\n\nP.S. The app is currently available only for iOS (since that’s what I know how to develop). If enough people are interested, I might work on an Android version in the future.\n",

      "content": "Dear Reddit, I am a 36yo female living in tropical SEA, so we only have humidity, sunlight and rain in the region.\n\nI am on Oratane / Accutane 20mg for a while now. \nI had been taking it since I was 18yo for my acne. Stopped for a couple of years and started again when I was 25yo. \nStopped and started again in recent years cos my backne and neckne was out of control. \n\nI was taking it daily for almost 3 months, then dropped it to alternate days, then once a week, and now I'm back to twice a week - 8 x 20mg oratane per month. \n\nAll these were upon my dermatologist's orders and prescription.\n\nI don't do fancy skincare as my face might be sensitive and I'm not keen to try. \n\nI use Cetaphil daily gentle cleanser to clean my bare face then, I will use a facial wash (gel not foam) that is from my doctor's to wash my face. \n\nIn the day, I put on a moisturizer from my doctor's, Kiehl's avocado eye cream, spf60 sunblock and draw my brows, put on mascara, lip stain and I'm out.\n\nAt night, I cleanse and wash my face, put on another (thicker) moisturizer that my doctor recommended me, the same eye cream and head to bed. \n\nWhen I have some pimples, I apply a bit Epiduo on those spots before I put on the moisturizer. \n\nOnce in a while, I do use Kiehl's avocado and calendula masks. Maybe once a week each.\n\nOn a monthly basis, I see my dermatologist for some laser treatments to help treat scars, 'burn out' acne (with precision lasers), hydra-facial machine where it pumps some hydrating serum into my face. \n\nI did some botox and profilo on my cheeks and jaw too.\n\nI consume collagen supplements (liquid and capsule) on a daily basis, I try to have at least 3 litres of water daily, and I try (my very Asian best) to cut down on salt and oil for my food. \nI also take a dandelion extract supplement that is supposedly for fluid balance and used for water retention.\nI have also quit alcohol for 2.5 years and quit smoking for 7 years.\n\nQuestion is, why does my skin seem to 'maintain' its status quo and not get better? Is there anything that the Redditors here can point out that I'm doing wrong or what I can improve on? \n\nMy neck and jaw is constantly \"puffy looking\" but I'm not fat. But it definitely makes me look like I'm ageing (badly).\n\nI don't need to have a flawless complexion (yes I want this) but I would like to have healthier skin. My acne gone now... I do have 1 or 2 stubborn pimples once in a while. My skin is still rough and bumpy. It doesn't look healthy, and there's no glow on it. Any glow on it looks like oily skin hahaha\n\nMy eye bags seem ok whenever I wake up. But like 12 hours after being up, it seems to look really bad and I look like I aged. Every morning, I do the iced metal spoons thing over my eyes. Should I continue? \n\nAre there other treatments that I need to check with my doctor?\nIs there anyone facing the same issues as I do?\n\nTo add: Exercise is something I'm trying my best to commit to. Understand that this might solve 70% of my problems but if anyone has a \"less exercise\" way of fixing things, I'm happy to hear!\n\nLastly, while I'm happy to try some treatments, I'm not really keen to try very invasive and surgical ones like face lifts etc. I'm also told that I can't do Rejuran because of my skin condition.",

      "content": "Help! Hi guys! This is going to be a long post but I need some help. So about a few years ago, whenever I got out of the shower and let my hair air dry, my hair would always get wavy and poofy and frizzy instead of staying straight. But I ignored that for years and kept treating my hair like it was straight, even straightening it regularly because I liked the sleek look.\n\nAbout two years ago, I discovered curly hair and wavy hair routines, so I tried some products and they worked really well. But the routine felt like too much of a hassle, so I went back to straightening.I also got keratin done in 2022. My hair was so damaged before thankfully I have recovered from that.\n\nRecently, I decided I want to wear my hair natural again, so I've been experimenting with different products. I also have high porosity hair now because I bleached it a few months ago, but I still don't feel like l've found the right routine.\n\nRight now, my curl routine is I use the Ouai Detox Shampoo and then the purple Pureology shampoo. I don't use a regular conditioner just deep conditioning masks. I rotate between the Fino mask, the Gisou mask, and the Amika Intense Bond Repair mask. After the shower, I dry my hair with a microfiber towel. For styling, curl creams weigh my hair down, so I stick to a lightweight leave in (the Pureology one works well for me).\n\nThen I use a mousse (either Umberto Giannini Curl Foam or Curlsmith Invincible Mousse) and a strong hold gel (Aveda Curl Enhancer Gel gives me a good cast). Sometimes I also use Curlsmith In-Shower Style Fixer. I either plop with a T-shirt or scrunch out excess water and diffuse on low speed/ medium heat. Hover and then cup diffuse.\n\nAt first, I get a great cast with really pretty waves and some spirals, but once I scrunch out the crunch, I end up with straight pieces and lose a lot of definition. The next day is even worse, even though I pineapple and sleep with a bonnet. It's honestly getting really demotivating.\n\nI also feel like I get all the volume at the bottom and my roots are flat I wanna get rid of the triangle. What type of haircut should I get to get rid of the triangle? Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong or what I should change? I get actual ringlets underneath my hair, so l'm not sure where I fall on the curl spectrum. And is curl training even a real thing? If so, how do you actually do it? Any advice would really help. Also all these pictures are recent except the last one its from 2023 when I first tried a curly routine! :)",
