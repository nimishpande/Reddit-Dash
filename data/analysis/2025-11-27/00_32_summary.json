      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "title": "Things I have noticed (good and bad) while taking topical Min+Fin",
      "content": "Hey! So i was balding pretty intensely and noticed it got really bad sometime around early 2025. After looking and getting over the fear mongering surrounding taking finasteride, i decided to pull the trigger and go with the first option that i saw, which was Hims topical fin+min. I started on August 27th, 2025 (first and second photo) and i am three months in! (third and fourth photo)\n\nDosage: Fin .3% Min 7% Ketoconazol 2.2% Biotin .2%\n\nApplied once a day to both sides of hairline, Top of head, and crown at night\n\nAlso wear a bonnet to sleep as i have a pet dog\n\nHere are a few things i’ve noticed both good and bad and what i wish i would’ve done differently\n\n• What would I have done differently?\n\nI would have started sooner. Although the progress is amazing and i’m really hopeful that most if not all of my past hairline will come back, i know that if i would’ve started this treatment sooner, i would’ve been able to go out in public without a hat. So if you’re noticing any type or hint of balding, don’t wait!!\n\nbe proactive, not reactive.\n\nIf your having to ask people if they think your balding, just assume you are and start treatment early.\n\n• Cons of treatment\n\nDefinitely the price for me. Although Hims is great and it def working, i do feel like there are some cheaper options out there. do your research and find the best option for you price wise\n\nChoosing topical products over oral. To me, it wasn’t worth the risk of ED as my “little man” works out pretty often…if yk what i mean. With that, studies show that topical has less of a chance to have adverse side effects compared to oral, although i have seen that oral does have a bigger chance to work at a higher rate. Not saying topical won’t work, it just might take longer.\n\nBrain fog like a MF. While taking topical fin+min, i started getting mad brain fog around week 5 of usage. Although it’s only usually in the mornings, it does hinder my ability to wake up and get ready for college, and usually lasts a good while. a great work around for this i found is just staying active. go gym, go run, and eat healthy!\n\n• Pros\n\nYOU GET YOUR HAIR BACK!\n\nI will be honest, it’s not coming in as fast as i hoped, but there is an amazing deal of growth here.\n\nin all, this is a journey and i’m very hopeful and excited to get my old head of hair back! If your questioning if instead is safe for you, take the leap. if your worried about ED being caused from finasteride, that’s okay and it’s smart your doing your research, that’s the whole reason i chose topical treatment instead of oral. Which ever you choose, just be proactive about it!",

For the past year or so, my upper lip hair has gotten SO much worse. I shave it every single morning before work, and by like… 2 or 3 PM I swear it looks like a faint 5 o’clock shadow. I’ll catch myself in the bathroom mirror during lunch and want to cry because it already looks like I didn’t even bother grooming that day.\n\nIt’s honestly exhausting.  \nI feel like I’m stuck in this never-ending cycle: shave → redness → irritation → a few hours of smooth skin → shadow comes back. Repeat. Every. Single. Day.  \nAnd the worst part? I’m constantly paranoid that people notice it before I do. I’ll be in a meeting and just thinking: “Is it showing? Can they see it? Is the lighting making it worse?” It sounds so small but it’s eating at my confidence.\n\nI’ve looked into laser but the prices are just… insane for me right now. I’m barely keeping up with rent, bills, and everything else, so dropping hundreds (or thousands??) on laser sessions just isn’t realistic.\n\nI feel really alone in this, and honestly a little unfeminine. Like why do I have to deal with this when none of my friends seem to? They’ll joke about “peach fuzz” meanwhile I’m over here feeling like I have a secret mustache that grows faster than my boyfriend’s beard.\n\nDoes anyone else deal with this?  \nHow do you manage it without constant shaving or irritation?  \nIs there ANYTHING that actually slows regrowth or makes it less noticeable?\n\nI just want to go one day—ONE DAY—without worrying that I look “unkept” because my upper lip hair is growing back faster than my self-esteem.\n\nAny advice or even just “same girl, same” would honestly help so much.",

At least offer me a sample first, because it’s not like I can return it if I think it’s trash.  She even said “if you buy it today you get a discount.”  I don’t know why it bothered me so much, but it did.\n\nDoes anybody know if the people that work at these sort of places make commissions on product sales?\n\nThe product she recommended was the Skinbetter Mystro Active Balance Serum.

      "content": "Help! Hi guys! This is going to be a long post but I need some help. So about a few years ago, whenever I got out of the shower and let my hair air dry, my hair would always get wavy and poofy and frizzy instead of staying straight. But I ignored that for years and kept treating my hair like it was straight, even straightening it regularly because I liked the sleek look.\n\nAbout two years ago, I discovered curly hair and wavy hair routines, so I tried some products and they worked really well. But the routine felt like too much of a hassle, so I went back to straightening.I also got keratin done in 2022. My hair was so damaged before thankfully I have recovered from that.\n\nRecently, I decided I want to wear my hair natural again, so I've been experimenting with different products. I also have high porosity hair now because I bleached it a few months ago, but I still don't feel like l've found the right routine.\n\nRight now, my curl routine is I use the Ouai Detox Shampoo and then the purple Pureology shampoo. I don't use a regular conditioner just deep conditioning masks. I rotate between the Fino mask, the Gisou mask, and the Amika Intense Bond Repair mask. After the shower, I dry my hair with a microfiber towel. For styling, curl creams weigh my hair down, so I stick to a lightweight leave in (the Pureology one works well for me).\n\nThen I use a mousse (either Umberto Giannini Curl Foam or Curlsmith Invincible Mousse) and a strong hold gel (Aveda Curl Enhancer Gel gives me a good cast). Sometimes I also use Curlsmith In-Shower Style Fixer. I either plop with a T-shirt or scrunch out excess water and diffuse on low speed/ medium heat. Hover and then cup diffuse.\n\nAt first, I get a great cast with really pretty waves and some spirals, but once I scrunch out the crunch, I end up with straight pieces and lose a lot of definition. The next day is even worse, even though I pineapple and sleep with a bonnet. It's honestly getting really demotivating.\n\nI also feel like I get all the volume at the bottom and my roots are flat I wanna get rid of the triangle. What type of haircut should I get to get rid of the triangle? Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong or what I should change? I get actual ringlets underneath my hair, so l'm not sure where I fall on the curl spectrum. And is curl training even a real thing? If so, how do you actually do it? Any advice would really help. Also all these pictures are recent except the last one its from 2023 when I first tried a curly routine! :)",

I’ve had my sister wash it for me this past weekend but it caused a lot of pain from the way I had to sit. I have my hair in Dutch/french braids all the time to keep it less matted and out of my face. It has still been getting super matted. \n\nI have thick long 2a to 3a. It doesn’t soak with water without having product through it first. My normal routine in general is shampoo, conditioner, olaplaex bonding oil, argan oil, leave in conditioner, curl definer. Then gets brushed and braid while wet. Sometimes had gel and hairspray to keep the braids intact for longer. \n\nWhen I can’t wash my hair, I use a detangler that’s a cheap kids (which doesn’t work as well as it should), water and sometimes more argan oil to loosen the knots. But lately nothing is helping and my hair breaks and the knots come out in clumps. It needs to not be too thick of a mixture and can be in my hair for 5 plus days after. I’ve been going about two weeks between washes at the moment. (Please don’t judge, plus my scalp is dealing with it a lot better than expected.) \n",

It looks and feels pretty dull, frizzy, and all over the place. I feel like there’s a mix of new growth (after about 1.5–2 years of excessive shedding) and breakage, especially in the top layers. The Top layers feel rough, scraggly, and uneven. Bottom layers are much smoother but also straighter. The hair closer to my scalp (bottom layers) is actually wavier than the mid/ends and my hair is not coloured. I’ve grown out and cut off all my old blonde\n\nWhat I’d love advice on:\n- How to have just nicer softer hair\n- Whether my wash routine needs a total overhaul\n- What products or steps I should be adding or removing\n- How to improve softness, shine, and wave definition without weighing everything down\n",
