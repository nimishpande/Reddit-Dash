      "content": "Not here to sell anything, and I’m not speaking for every provider or clinic. This is just what I’ve consistently seen move the needle for people’s skin over years of working in medical aesthetics and consulting with regulated health-care teams.\n\nSkincare can feel overwhelming, but the ingredients that work long-term are surprisingly consistent. Here’s what actually delivers noticeable improvement when used correctly and consistently! \n\n  \n**For pigmentation and stubborn** discolouration\n\nHydroquinone (at least 2%)  \nStill one of the strongest short-term options for targeted pigment concerns. Usually used in cycles because it’s potent.\n\nNiacinamide (Vitamin B3)  \nGood for general discoloration, redness, and supporting the barrier.\n\nAzelaic Acid  \nGentle, versatile, and effective for pigmentation, redness, and texture issues.\n\nTranexamic Acid  \nOften helps with melasma-type uneven tone and overall brightening over time.\n\n**For anti-aging and long-term skin quality**\n\nRetinol or Tretinoin  \nStill the most reliable ingredient for improving texture, fine lines, and overall skin quality.\n\nVitamin C + E + Peptides  \nA brightening, antioxidant-rich combination that helps support healthier-looking skin.\n\nPeptides  \nUseful for strengthening the skin and improving resilience when used consistently.\n\nSunscreen  \nThe ingredient that protects all of the above from going to waste.\n\n**For hydration and barrier repair**\n\nHyaluronic Acid  \nBest used on damp skin and sealed with a moisturizer to prevent moisture loss.\n\nCeramides  \nEssential for repairing and reinforcing the skin barrier.\n\nUrea (low percentage)  \nHelps with smoothness, hydration, and softening rough patches.\n\nCicaplast Baume B5  \nConsistently helpful for calming irritation, supporting barrier repair, and restoring comfort when the skin is stressed or over-exfoliated.\n\n**For acne-prone or congested skin**\n\nSalicylic Acid (BHA)  \nKeeps pores clear and helps reduce inflammation.\n\nBenzoyl Peroxide  \nStill one of the most effective tools for managing acne-causing bacteria.\n\nAdapalene  \nA beginner-friendly retinoid that supports both acne control and long-term skin refinement.\n\n**General principles that make the biggest difference**\n\n\\- Consistency is more important than product count (can take sometimes months to see real permanent change, give a product at least a month of consistent use before deciding if it helps you or not) \n\n\\- Barrier health should always come first\n\n\\- Introduce new products slowly\n\n\\- Use one strong active at a time\n\n\\- Water intake and a balanced diet genuinely impact skin behaviour\n\n\\- Sunscreen determines how well all other products work",

      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

The underneath section of my hair near my nape is naturally much more straight, has a bit of wave, while the top of my hair is ringlet curls. It has always been this way since i was young no matter the length of my hair, it’s not from damage I swear. I am growing my hair out for the first time in years, it’s always been cut around my collar bones. But now i’m running into the issue that since my hair is much more fine (fine as in strand size) and straight on the underneath section, it keeps getting tangled and matted when i sleep with a bonnet or any other way, or also just by going through my day normally. It used to do this when I was young and i forgot until now (maybe why I had it cut shorter in the first place lol). Does anyone have any advice? I’m not sure if there’s anything I can do tbh. I never really get any knots anywhere else in my hair only this section. \nMy routine is AG ultra moist conditioner &amp; shampoo, AG fast food leave in conditioner, and auntie jackie’s curl boss coconut curling gelée (highly recommend this one). Then I just diffuse. The photos are taken a few hours after washing, so this is what the underneath is like in its best curl state lol (which is saying a lot)\nplease help! lol thank you",

      "content": "Hoping for some advice here from people who are having the same issue. My front and sides are decently curly but my back is only wavy in comparison. Of course, this gets elevated by sleeping on it and so on.\n\nI'll do my usual routine, as stated below, and diffuse with Dyson, then scrunch curls when fully dry. Sometimes I use one drop of hair oil for this step, sometimes not, just whatever I feel like doing that day.\n\nI've tried stronger hold gels to no effect, did finger curling, tried upside down styling exclusively, I even used the Bounce Curl Brush. I have rather fine hair and this thing makes my hair so incredibly shiny and frizz free but sadly sucks out all the measly volume there is. The best way to handle the back of my head for now is to style regularly and then diffuse upside down but this often leaves me with a lot of mess (as well as some stronger curled waves). Problem is, to get rid of this mess, meaning some unwanted parting, I use my flat iron to even things out. Most of the time this means killing some of the pretty curly waves. Even finger combing before diffusing to get some order into my hair does not help anything.\n\nNicer waves/curls + messy back of my head or pretty loose and shiny waves. It feels like I can't get one or the other. My sides are nice and bouncy and hold up so nicely even with me only using mousse. A curly cut is already off the table since I'm worried this will make me look like a spaghetti monster.\n\nCurrent routine (just 1 of each):    \n1. Pantene Volume &amp; Body OR Ouai Detox OR Wella Nutri Curls shampoo     \n2. L'Oreal Glycolic Gloss Conditioner OR L'Oreal Bond Repair Conditioner    \n3. Every 4th wash K18 mask    \n4. Pantene Miracle Rescue Leave-In OR Pureology Color Fanatic Spray    \n5. Pantene Perfect Waves Mousse (applied with prayer hands and scrunched)",

      "content": "I just need to vent. I have been having red bumps on my forehead, chest and neck for years. I have tried what feels like everything, both prescription and not, and I have seen my GP and two, now three derms. I am already on tretinoin, clindamycin and azealic acid, all which I had to ask for myself after doing research.\n\nI decided to splurge on a private derm today, because I’m just so sick of the itchy bumps. He took a quick look at it and said it was congested skin. I tried to explain that it flares up, gets red and itchy, and no amount of exfoliation removes it. I have tried both tret, AHA and BHA, and the area with bumps just gets red and angry. It’s like a layer or film over my skin. He just said I «needed to moisturize every day». I do! That it not the problem?!\n\nI asked for some testing to see if it could be fungal or something to do with mites, because my eyes are often itchy and red too. He laughed and said that it’s not necessary, he could see what it was. He was so arrogant and dismissive, I ended up just paying and leaving.\n\nI’m so tired of this. I have spent SO much money on this, I only use a few hypo allergenic products because my skin reacts with a flare up by almost everything. And nothing works, the bumps wont go away. I don’t know what else to do. I just feel so hopeless.",

I haven’t noticed much of a difference.\n* SOTC once hair is completely dry\n    * Overnight: Medusa clip and satin pillowcase\n    * If it’s a night shower: leave hair in cast and gently Medusa clip\n",

I've only been using the terbinafine for 3 days and I've seen a great improvement. I want to start using retinal and I was hoping for some advice. I might not start it yet and try to get the fungal acne more stable first but I'm just thinking ahead.\n\n  \nI wasn't sure where in my routine to put the retinal. I planned to not use it on the days I use ketoconazole or salicylic acid face wash to not overload my skin I wasn't sure whether to put it on before or after the terbinafine and barrier serum. I've seen some people recommend putting the retinal on after the barrier serum but I apply my terbinafine before my barrier serum. Will that be too many layers for the retinal to have a good effect?\n\n  \nThanks in advance :)",

This was not entirely my decision, but it is an obvious problem...)\n\nThe results are much better than what I was doing a few months before I started, but they are still poor;  \n\\- The biggest issue is that my curls have hardly any definition to speak of.  \n\\- My hair is rather limp.  \n\\- I find I get more frizz than is normal.\n\nI am asking for advice on what products I ought to use instead, and also on how I should use them. Keep in mind that where I live has a lack of quality hairdressers and beauty-stores, and so I find it hard to find quality products and advice.

      "content": "sorry for the long post, really struggling to figure out my hair and just having a lot of confusion and frustration. \n\nfirst 4 photos are styled today using gel, last 3 photos are how i previously styled without gel.\n\nmy hair is fine, low to medium density, high porosity. i think type 2C. \n\nROUTINE:\nproducts included in the photos. i clarify 1x a month otherwise shampoo 1-2x a week and cowash + conditioner daily. \n\nout of the shower, i typically use 8 sprays of the leave in then about a fingertip amount of the curl cream scrunched into my hair, occasionally 2-3 drops of oil as well when i shampoo or things feel dry. i also recently started trying gel shown in the first 4 photos.\n\nfor styling, what i used to do apply all the products in then scrunch all over to define the curls, but it just looked very messy and unruly. once i started with the gel, im trying to comb with a wide tooth everything straight back THEN scrunch everything out, but i just hate the way my hair looks. \n\nin the last 3 photos, thats what my hair looked like without gel and without combing, purely just styling with my hands and scrunching. i LOVE the way the back and sides look, but from the front it just looks really frizzed out and stringy, where the sides/back have thicker curl clusters. \n\nalso, since i wasn’t using anything with hold, the slightest gust of wind and my hair gets completely ruined which is why i decided to start using gel. but in the first 4 photos where i have gel, i just hate the way it looks. it almost looks greasy and not curly and just not at all like before when i didn’t use gel and comb it.  also my hair still gets ruined by wind??? like is my hair just extremely lightweight?\n\ni’ve also tried looking for other men with curly hair and how they style their hair but literally all i can find is they just use leave in conditioner then shake out their hair, but mine literally looks TERRIBLE if i style it like that. \n\njust really need some guidance on all this. am i using the wrong products? am i using too much or too little? is it in the wrong order? do i suck at styling? is it my haircut? do i even have curly hair?",
