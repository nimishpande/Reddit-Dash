      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

I lost 2/3rds of it over the course of my ed. \n\nBut now, three months into recovery and my hairfall has reduced drastically; it no longer falls out in clumps in the shower. The areas where I lost hair the most is covered in baby hairs.

The underneath section of my hair near my nape is naturally much more straight, has a bit of wave, while the top of my hair is ringlet curls. It has always been this way since i was young no matter the length of my hair, it’s not from damage I swear. I am growing my hair out for the first time in years, it’s always been cut around my collar bones. But now i’m running into the issue that since my hair is much more fine (fine as in strand size) and straight on the underneath section, it keeps getting tangled and matted when i sleep with a bonnet or any other way, or also just by going through my day normally. It used to do this when I was young and i forgot until now (maybe why I had it cut shorter in the first place lol). Does anyone have any advice? I’m not sure if there’s anything I can do tbh. I never really get any knots anywhere else in my hair only this section. \nMy routine is AG ultra moist conditioner &amp; shampoo, AG fast food leave in conditioner, and auntie jackie’s curl boss coconut curling gelée (highly recommend this one). Then I just diffuse. The photos are taken a few hours after washing, so this is what the underneath is like in its best curl state lol (which is saying a lot)\nplease help! lol thank you",

I’m starting to think it might be because my moisturiser isn’t hydrating enough (I’m using the Purito Oat-In Calming Gel).\n\nI’ve been reading through the forum and saw a lot of people saying that layering toners and essences can help with hydration and possibly control oil production. One product that kept coming up was the Isntree Green Tea Fresh Toner, which sounds great for sebum control and is something I’d really like to try. But I also read that it can be a bit dehydrating, which worries me because I’m currently using acids like lactic acid and I’m planning to introduce salicylic acid in the future – so hydration feels pretty important right now.\n\nMy question is: would it be possible to use the Green Tea Fresh Toner *together* with a more hydrating essence to balance things out? If so, what kind of hydrating essence would you recommend pairing it with? And if that’s not a good idea, what would you suggest I do instead for oily but dehydrated skin?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice! 🙏\n\n  \nCurrent Routine \n\nAm \n\nNuetrogena Hydro boost Cleanser \n\nSkin1004 Centella Ampoule \n\nPurito Oat In Calming Gel\n\nCosrx Ultra-Light Invisible Sunscreen \n\n  \nPm\n\nNuetrogena Hydro boost Cleanser \n\nTO Lactic Acid 5% ( Only on Sunday, Tuesday and Friday nights )\n\nPurito Oat In Calming Gel",

This was not entirely my decision, but it is an obvious problem...)\n\nThe results are much better than what I was doing a few months before I started, but they are still poor;  \n\\- The biggest issue is that my curls have hardly any definition to speak of.  \n\\- My hair is rather limp.  \n\\- I find I get more frizz than is normal.\n\nI am asking for advice on what products I ought to use instead, and also on how I should use them. Keep in mind that where I live has a lack of quality hairdressers and beauty-stores, and so I find it hard to find quality products and advice.

      "title": "MAELYS - A SCAM COMPANY",
      "content": "I want to share my recent experience with Maelys Cosmetics **(A SCAM COMPANY)** in hopes this will help someone avoid the headaches I went through. I’ve documented and saved screenshots/receipts from almost every interaction I had with them, and I’ll be including them in this post.\n\nA couple months ago, I kept seeing Maelys ads on Instagram. They pushed their products along with a **Try Before You Buy (TBYB)** program. I had seen this brand sold at Ulta, which made it feel more legitimate to me, I assumed a retailer as large as Ulta would thoroughly vet the brands they carry, or at least ensure they weren't operating with deceptive or predatory practices.\n\nEven so, I was still a little skeptical being this was my first try before you buy experience and kept a second eye out throughout the checkout process. I read every line of fine print and it seemed to all look good. The only things I knowingly agreed to was:\n\n* Pay shipping upfront\n* Trying the product for 3 weeks - starting from the delivery date of the product\n* I could return it within the 3 week trial window if I didn’t like it to avoid being charged\n* If I didn’t return it, then I would pay for the product\n\n**What actually happened: they refused to honor the trial period AND tried forcing a subscription on me that I never consented to. Here is the timeline of how things went down.**\n\n**7/2 (PIC #3)** **—** Ordered the B-Tight TBYB product. Paid $6.47 (shipping + tax)\n\n**7/10 —** TBYB product delivered. 3-week trial period starts\n\n**7/30 —** I was very consistent with applying the product for weeks but unfortunately saw no results. Last day of my 3-week trial, I reached out via their return chat to initiate a return. **No response from them**\n\n**7/31 —** I contacted them again the next day. This time they responded but said I “missed the window.” I honestly blamed myself for not reaching out a day or two earlier before the last day window(7/30) so I was okay with paying for TBYB products and accepted the charge of $43\n\n**8/2 —** I suddenly receive an order confirmation for $49.47 for ***a subscription.*** **I was extremely confused**\n\n**8/2 (PIC #4) —** I immediately go to their website and contact their chat. They tell me, ***“Your initial TBYB trial converted into a subscription as designed.”*** **This was never disclosed anywhere during checkout process.** They said they’ll cancel my subscription, I assumed this meant they would cancel/not ship out the subscription that just got confirmed earlier in the day and stop any further charges\n\n**8/4 —** I receive an email that the subscription has been shipped\n\n**8/4 (PIC #5) —** Frustrated and fed up with this bs, I file a Better Business Bureau(BBB) complaint with screenshots of my checkout process and question why they can start a subscription service on my account without ever disclosing it. This is also when I realize **there are thousands of similar complaints like mine on the** [**BBB site**](https://www.bbb.org/us/ny/staten-island/profile/skin-care/maelys-cosmetics-usa-inc-0121-87147134/complaints?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=PMAX+Startnow+20&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=6830342630&amp;hsa_cam=23267566799&amp;hsa_grp=&amp;hsa_ad=&amp;hsa_src=x&amp;hsa_tgt=&amp;hsa_kw=&amp;hsa_mt=&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23262540642&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADmhR62vzHEqMQ2_5reT6o8ahMOnm&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA55rJBhByEiwAFkY1QL6ZeIIkh2HTpky4KGNa6e8stlhHLtpgFHJV1mYiq1dygiN-9C8GRhoCSNUQAvD_BwE) against this company. It's disgusting D:\n\n**8/5 (PIC #6) —** Maleys responds through the BBB complaint and basically repeats what their customer service chat had previously relayed **“subscription started upon checkout of your TBYB order. It has now been cancelled.”** **They ignore the lack of disclosure/consent.** (They state my order was placed 8/25, when it was only 8/5.. I think they just copy and pasted a template without ever looking into my order.)\n\n**8/5 (PIC #7) —** I go to their website and reach out to their customer service again and try to arrange a return for the subscription they shipped out. They said they’d email me. **I don't get a email**\n\n**8/7 —** Subscription product is delivered\n\n**8/8 (PIC #8) —** I contact chat again. They think I’m trying to return the TBYB product. I clarify it’s the subscription I never signed up for, but they only say my subscription is canceled going forward. **They close the chat** and refuse to address returning the unwanted subscription package\n\n**8/8 (PIC #9) —** I update my BBB complaint as “not resolved.” They said I missed the TBYB window – fine, I’ll take that (technically they never responded to me the first time I reached out to initiate the return, which caused me to miss the window). But I’m not paying for the subscription, nor do I want the products that I never consented to. I again ask them to show where on throughout the checkout process it states the subscription will start upon checkout of TBYB order\n\n**8/8 —** I dispute the $49.47 charge with my credit card company\n\n**8/12 (PIC #10) —** Maelys responds through the BBB complaint and says they have emailed me a return label (I'm assuming this is because the dispute hit their end, otherwise they would probably just brush me off again)\n\n**8/21 —** I ship back the subscription package (never opened)\n\n**8/27 —** USPS tracking shows it delivered\n\n**8/29 —** I receive a refund of **$43.57** from Maelys – **$5.90 less** than what I paid for the subscription. **They essentially tried charging me for the shipping label** for a product I did not order, did not want, and only received because they didn't to cancel the shipment. Again, I dispute this amount with my credit card company and ask them to block all future attempted charges from Maelys\n\n[#1 - Maelys Charges](https://preview.redd.it/maux3rwsxp3g1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f3f2a70c0e7ca7b38196afe9172e7ed1494934e)\n\n[#2 - Maelys Emails](https://preview.redd.it/zll1plypsp3g1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=748492fa987b57cf23f29a222061b2d2260f07db)\n\n[#3 - 7\\/2 Maelys Checkout Process](https://preview.redd.it/3tu7b270tp3g1.jpg?width=3451&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=787b5890a00e8b9d9592c8d8c730e808aaacae4c)\n\n[#4 - 8\\/2 Convo with Maelys Customer Support](https://preview.redd.it/rrik7u89tp3g1.jpg?width=4590&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d721e8d95aeaa512c8b572868088bb329334ae02)\n\n[#5- 8\\/4 Filed BBB Complaint](https://preview.redd.it/gdi2sv49up3g1.jpg?width=2464&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e21b9274867452c1403f572f85593a781a7d4e0d)\n\n[#6 - 8\\/5 Maely's Initial Reponse to BBB Complaint](https://preview.redd.it/ze5zgi1hup3g1.jpg?width=2466&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2878f7915e8baeb7a1a240e1a5802ff721d36509)\n\n[#7 - 8\\/5 Convo with Maelys Customer Support](https://preview.redd.it/ecjzl8jnup3g1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e2a9dec0dae2171eddedcfc047fbf8d00229245)\n\n[#8 - 8\\/8 Convo with Maelys Customer Support](https://preview.redd.it/u3sb4ec5vp3g1.jpg?width=4590&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98bcb7a9daacd04e068b3acf3b93cc30eb08ef8c)\n\n[#9 - 8\\/8 Updated BBB Complaint](https://preview.redd.it/lcthz4vcvp3g1.jpg?width=2462&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67d820717ce4aab98c6e7586acbb35047695c546)\n\n[#10 - 8\\/12 Maely's 2nd Reponse to BBB Complaint](https://preview.redd.it/5dxrmezgvp3g1.jpg?width=2468&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c47feb87e5028e6f82a1c7ea9894477d66a1c19)",
