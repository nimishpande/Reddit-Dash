      "content": "My son has beautiful curly hair but it’s very fine and gets frizzy and tangly so easily. Is there any way to keep his curls mostly intact overnight? I’ve tried a bonnet, but they typically slip off his head while he’s sleeping so now I do a loose bun on top of his head. Sometimes in the morning, I can take out the bun, wet the hair that gets frizzy around his face and it’ll do in a pinch. If I want the curls to look nice again though, I completely wet it with water and leave in conditioner and comb it out. This definitely works, but I feel bad sending him to school with damp hair, especially in the colder months. Are there any other options to keep his curls overnight or to refresh them in the morning without getting his hair completely wet? Any suggestions would be so appreciated!\n\nI have straight hair and my husband has much thicker curly hair so these types of curls are new to him too so we’re both trying our best to learn as we go.\n\n(The first picture is of his hair still a little damp and freshly washed and the second picture shows his hair let down from sleeping in a bun and fixed up as much as I could without starting from scratch)\n\nOur wash routine: We wash with Honest shampoo and conditioner, then use finger comb through a bit of Alaffia leave in conditioner and let air dry. \n",

I've been told by stylists in the past that I have lots of very fine hair. I've tried sooo many products over the years and they either weighed my hair down, made it look oily or just didn't seem to do anything.

If\nanyone cares to share any advice with me, I'd greatly appreciate it! \n\nMy routine: Shampoo and condition every other day (usually at night) with Carina\nOrganics Citrus Daily moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. \nLive Clean Weightless Volume Clean Air\nshampoo once a week or so. \nBatiste Bare dry shampoo in between wash days\nTresemmé heat protection spray when straightening\n\nThanks in advance for any recommendations!\n\n",

And sometimes, it goes to another level - skin care unforgivable sins! Most of us have been there at least once.\n\nI'll start and let me say, with the power of hindsight, I am so ashamed:\n\n- for years, and I mean 20+, I used soap to wash my face. Why? My mom, who's always had flawless, spotless, almost poreless skin and never even needed a foundation claimed that soap is the best thing to wash your face. An old-fashioned grey household soap to be exact. Now, I have always had acne-prone, mixed of oily and dry skin and while I didn't use grey soap but Dove soap for my face, it was still freaking RIDICULOUS! And only a few months ago when I switched to a very simplified Korean beauty routine (cleanser gel, toner, serum, moisturiser) my skin got without exaggeration 90% better. I'm an idiot to have only come to my senses at almost 42.\n\n- the other thing is also super gross in hindsight. At some point in 2018 maybe I decided sustainability is my new thing. So, to remove makeup I started using reusable cotton pads. In itself nothing bad, right? The only thing is, I felt it was wasteful to only use them once and wash. So I used them for 3-4 days. By day 2 or 3 they were already basically dirty, and I kept them to dry on the side of my bathroom sink so often they even smelled bad. Gross, gross, gross 😵‍💫 I can't imagine the cocktail of dirt and bacteria I was energetically pressing onto my face (coz I also believed it was nice, natural exfoliation 🤡🤡🤡)\n\nIf you dare, share the stupid skincare things/habits you did. Don't make me be the only one here 😅",

      "content": "Hi there, I desperately need your help :(\nMy nails are basically separating into layers. This happened once before in 2020\n1 and only went away after about 2 years. I have no idea why it started and no idea why it stopped. Before that I had strong nails (always natural, never used nail polish, don't wear any sort of fake nails, never used oils or anything).\nFor two years I couldn't even touch stuff without breaking something.\nAnd now it's returned.\n\nSince I've been \"blessed\" with cystic fibrosis I'm getting a giant blood panel every 3 months so I know that my iron/ferritin, B12 and vitamin d as well as my thyroid are fine. My other values are good too.\nBtw: I have the actual numbers and not just a dismissive \"it's fine\" from a doctor so I know my values are on the higher end for what's normal for the vitamins and iron.\n\nI have used various types of nail hardeners like sililevo, SI nails, Opi repair mode vs. nail polishes like OPI nail envy or Miro cell that you reapply every day for a week - except despite the nail polish the upper layer of my nail excuses itself long before I'm even able to reach a week.\nI use acetone free nail removers.\n\nI also supplement biotin and basically all vitamins (no drug store products but actual medication, again due to my cystic fibrosis and doctors orders).\nThe CF also isn't the reason why this happens. At  least my doctor's know of no other patient with this issue.\n\nMy toenails don't have this issue, they keep slicing through my socks like it's what they've been born to do. My hair is fine but strong enough to build bridges from.\n\nI use a glass nail file. I try to protect my hands with gloves when cleaning and washing dishes. I don't think I wash my hands too often.l because o only wash when I have a reason (cooking, coming in from outside, toilet).\n\nMy nails used to be so strong but ever since the first time I had this issue they have been weak no matter how much nail oil I use. And now the plague is back and parts of my nails keep chipping off during the day (mostly thumb, pointer and middle finger). Please help!\n\nIf you can recommend helpful products that would be great, especially if they were available in Germany where I live.",

      "content": "hi everyone, I am a long time lurker but I’m finally at my wits end so am posting here hoping to get some help! \n\nI’m going to book a haircut tomorrow but I don’t know what to ask for. These pics are what I’m currently working with and it’s been 6+ months since my last cut. My hair is quite thick and doesn’t look good just hanging down around my face so I wear it half-up pretty much every day just to keep it somewhat controlled, but I don’t like it that much. \n\nI want to go get a haircut that will give it a nice shape when down and complement the waves! Does anyone have any advice for what kind of cut would suit me? I have quite a square face so a style that softens that would be better.\n\nLast time I got my hair cut I asked for long layers and face framing but it turned out horribly - the guy cut these big chunks around my face that didn’t blend into my hair at all, imagine a set of stairs, that’s what it looked like. My fault for getting enticed by a £25 cut. You can still see it a bit in pic 2. The hairdresser I’m going to this time comes recommended by my friend who has an absolutely stunning head of red ringlets so fingers crossed. \n\nMy current routine is Tesco citrus shampoo and coconut conditioner (don’t judge, I’m poor) but I just ordered the Aveeno rose water shampoo and conditioner as I want to see if sulfate free anti-frizz products work for me. I use Umberto giannini curl foam and then a small bit of Umberto giannini curl jelly to hold down the frizz, then let it air dry. Hairdryers / diffusing makes the puffiness/frizz a million times worse. I’ve tried scrunching in my products vs smoothing them over my hair but I haven’t noticed a difference in the end result, the waves still appear in their usual pattern. I’ve tried so many different methods and products over the last 2 years and this is the best I have found so far.\n\nSorry for the long post, I really really want to sort my hair out! My main question would be what kind of cut should I go for but if anyone has more general advice I welcome that too! Thank you in advance !",

I’ve seen a dermatologist and was prescribed clindamycin which works pretty well to control my breakouts. However this texture drives me crazy. Right now I use a salicylic acid cleanser from CeraVe. I follow it up with my clindamycin and then the skin medica retinol complex .25.

I saw that the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Eye Cream was a great product to combat this, but I can only find it online, as it seems to be an EU-based product. Usually, I wouldn't mind paying the extra shipping and handling to get the product imported; however, the tariffs that are being imposed are ridiculous... like $150 on a $30 product.\n\nThat being said, are there any products similar to this one on the US market? Do you guys have any recommendations for products to help itchy eyelids in general?\n\nI've been putting Aquaphor on my eyes and using CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream. I don't wear makeup on a daily basis, but I bought new mascara, eyebrow gel, and concealer. I use micellar water to take my makeup off, sometimes wash my face with Tula Cult Classic Purifying Cleanser in the shower, and intermittently use the Ordinary Retinol 2%.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",

I have tried a slew of products and even home remedies, but none seem to help.\n\nSo, seeing this and seeing how my skin has changed in the last year or so to just look... bad... I was wondering if anyone had any product recommendations.\n\nCurrently, I am using an oil cleanser and The Ordinary's niacinamide serum. It does seem to be helping slightly, but I am open to anything else. \n\nDon't be fooled by the sheen in the photo - my skin is naturally dry. It doesn't matter how much I moisturize, I know that my makeup will forever look dry.\n\nI am working on diet changes and increasing water intake to help, but is there anything I can do for the (what I presume to be) sebum plugs and pores? I know that skin has texture, so I don't expect glass skin but I am hoping some improvement can be made.\n\nThank you! Xx",

It’s like no matter how much I moisturize, the dryness always creeps back as soon as autumn hits. My skin barrier also seems super reactive, sometimes even gentle products make me flush or sting.\n\nHere’s my current routine (open to suggestions!):\n\nAM:\n\n\\- La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser\n\n\\- Klairs Supple Preparation Unscented Toner (I pat it in with my hands - I stopped using cotton pads because they made my skin worse)\n\n\\- The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5\n\n\\- CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (the big tub, my holy grail for locking in moisture)\n\n\\- Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics SPF50+\n\nPM:\n\n\\- La Roche-Posay Toleriane Cleanser again\n\n\\- Ulike Reglow LED Mask (mostly use the yellow, red and infrared for soothing)\n\n\\- La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5\n\n\\- Squalane oil (just 2 drops pressed into my cheeks and forehead as the last step)\n\nThis combo has definitely made my skin feel calmer, but the flakiness still sneaks in, especially on the sides of my nose and around my mouth. Sometimes I’ll wake up and my skin looks dull and tight no matter how much I layer the night before.\n\nI don’t exfoliate much anymore because most acids wreck my barrier, but I’ve been considering a super gentle PHA toner again.\n\nSo I guess my questions are:\n\n\\- Should I be layering my products differently to trap more moisture?\n\n\\- Would adding something like a humidifier or occlusive balm at night help more than oils?\n\nAny advice for dry, redness-prone skin in fall/winterwould be super appreciated - thank you!",

I'm already pushing it with the price of some of the other products I use.\n\nI used to use a mandelic serum from a small acne/aesthetician clinic but it was almost $70 for a 1 oz bottle and it made my skin so irritated and discolored I had to stop. It did clear my skin up nicely, but the discoloration/irritation wasn't worth it.\n\nBecause I had success with mandelic acid clearing my skin in the past, I've decided to try this one made by The Ordinary. I've been using it only every third night for the last week and so far it is not irritating my skin.\n\nHas anyone had success with this brand of mandelic acid? Is there anything else I could be using along with it for greater success?\n\nMy skincare routine is this:\n\nAM: CeraVe foaming facial cleanser, Dieux air angel moisturizer, Alastin Hydratint sunscreen\n\nPM: Dermalogica pre cleanse, CeraVe foaming facial cleanser, The Ordinary mandelic acid, Dieux instant angel moisturizer\n\nI don't wear makeup on the daily, if I ever do it is BareMinerals brand powered foundation.\n\nThanks for reading through this and for any advice!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
