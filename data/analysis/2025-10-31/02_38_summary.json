I get ropey waves\n\nSeparating them does nothing other than turn them in skinnier ropes waves and it just looks like I have dreads.\n\nI know my hair can not do this, as it's happened before, and that's because it was the 2nd day, I steamed my curls in the shower and ran my wet hands through them. Unfortunately no photo since it was a once in a lifetime experience I'm sorry.\n\nI don't know why we need to submit a routine just for basic help considering nobody knows wtf products we use if we're not from the US but hey! here you go:\n\n1. Sulkin volumising conditioner (protein) or garnier watermelon conditioner \n2. Redwon teatree shampoo (clarifier) or garnier watermelon shampoo\n3. vo5 megahold gel\n4. sometimes a leave-in conditioner on the ends\n\nOther methods I've tried:\n\n1. Scrunching conditioner in the shower upside down (no)\n2. Only using gel on the ends/mids (no)\n3. Not diffusing my hair (no)\n4. Diffusing my hair (no)\n5. Deep conditioning my hair (no)\n6. Not conditioning my hair at all, just shampoo &amp; gel (no)\n7. Separating my curls when wet or dry (no)\n\nWhat can be done 😭",

      "content": "My son has beautiful curly hair but it’s very fine and gets frizzy and tangly so easily. Is there any way to keep his curls mostly intact overnight? I’ve tried a bonnet, but they typically slip off his head while he’s sleeping so now I do a loose bun on top of his head. Sometimes in the morning, I can take out the bun, wet the hair that gets frizzy around his face and it’ll do in a pinch. If I want the curls to look nice again though, I completely wet it with water and leave in conditioner and comb it out. This definitely works, but I feel bad sending him to school with damp hair, especially in the colder months. Are there any other options to keep his curls overnight or to refresh them in the morning without getting his hair completely wet? Any suggestions would be so appreciated!\n\nI have straight hair and my husband has much thicker curly hair so these types of curls are new to him too so we’re both trying our best to learn as we go.\n\n(The first picture is of his hair still a little damp and freshly washed and the second picture shows his hair let down from sleeping in a bun and fixed up as much as I could without starting from scratch)\n\nOur wash routine: We wash with Honest shampoo and conditioner, then use finger comb through a bit of Alaffia leave in conditioner and let air dry. \n",

      "content": "Hi, can anyone help me out? The hair above &amp; in front of my ears is a lot straighter than the rest of my hair. Ive always had parts of my hair that were a little more curly but its gotten worse. Here's some info in case any of this is important:\n\n*I'm mixed (half black, half white) &amp; in my 40s.\n*I do straighten my hair sometimes using a Chi Lava plate straightener which is at 250 degrees &amp; always use heat protectant.\n\nRoutine: I don't always use the same products &amp; don't always use a diffuser, but this was my routine today when these pix were taken. However this is an issue no matter what the routine is. \n\nSol de Janiero shampoo, Garnier Fructis Sleek conditioner in the shower. Sprayed a little conditioner/water mix &amp; used a detangling comb for detangling. Small amount of Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine for heat protection. Mizani True Textures Curls, Coils &amp; Waves for definition. Diffused until mostly dry (had to go somewhere &amp; was running late) with a TGIBedhead diffuser (dont know the name but its the one thats JUST a diffuser) on medium heat &amp; high speed.\n\n I'm including pix that show my whole head of hair also so you can get an idea how the majority looks vs the problem areas. I've spent my entire life figuring out how to work with my hair &amp; its still a work in progress so please be nice 🙏🏼. All pix are from today since I needed to include the routine. I would love to know any tips on getting the curl texture back or making them look better. Thanks in advance. ",

      "content": "So I switched skincare routines back in August because I was dealing with breakouts and inflammation on my cheeks. (not sure what caused the cheek inflammation.) I was recommended products in store (some I was already planning to buy from my own research) and ended up getting the Inkey List oat cleansing balm, Byoma Jelly Cleanser, (double cleanse,) Byoma milky toner, Inkeylist water cream and Byoma hydrating recovery oil. She recommended I start using the dermalogica daily microfoliant a couple weeks after changing routines. I’m currently on week 8 of my new routine, and my skin is much more soft and hydrated, as well as much of the irritation on my cheeks clearing up. I use the microfoliant about twice a week because I don’t want to overdo it. I have an oily t-zone and I never broke out much on my cheeks when I started getting acne. I get whiteheads now more than ever on my cheeks (not many just annoying.) And around my period my hormonal acne looks worse than it has before, jawline, chin, neck all break out. My jawline will get like red bumps and whiteheads that come up to my chin. Is there something I can add into my routine that will help take care of the whiteheads? Should I continue using the routine till I hit the 12 week mark? The new routine had initially cleared my skin pretty much around week 3, and now it just seems like my skin has maybe one good week and then two bad weeks.\n\nI didn’t know who else to ask, I’m getting a little worried that I’m doing something wrong. Apologies for the long post and if anyone has any advice to offer, I’d greatly appreciate it!",

      "content": "We already know from Robbins and many other sources that the force for dry combing curly hair is lower when the hair is wet vs. dry. An intriguing recent paper explores another aspect of how curly hair might be different: the bonds.\n\nCloete E, Ngoepe MN, Ismail E, Khumalo NP. Weak Hydrogen Bonds in Temporary Shape Changes of Curly Human Hair Fibers: Preliminary Evidence. *J Invest Dermatol*. 2025;145(1):185-188. doi:[10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2024.06.1282)\n\nI believe this paper is open access and [here is the link.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X24018876)\n\nSome things to notice right off the bat:\n\n* This is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it is a letter to the editor\n* It is titled \"Preliminary evidence\"\n\nStill it is worth reading. I would love for someone other than me to read it because it does approach the limits of my education, which did not go far into biochem or physics.\n\nHere are the things I thought were interesting:\n\n* \"Considering differentiation between H-bond types, stress relaxation experiments suggest enhanced rather than reduced strength in wet conditions for curly fibers\" which is wild if true, that would mean the hair is STRONGER when wet, when other hair types are weaker\n* There are two types of Hydrogen (H) bonds they talk about in hair. The \"Type I\" which we all have, which are strong H bonds spanning the cortex. But there is another type they propose \"Type II\" which is specific to very curly hair\n* \"Type II\" Hydrogen bonds are weaker H-bonds, but as a network they resist water\n* \"Consequently, curly hair is expected to demonstrate resistance to wetting and a lesser reduction in overall bond strength than straight hair.\"\n\nI find this very interesting given the fact that a lot of the laymen's understanding of porosity comes from concepts originating in the Natural Hair movement. It may not be about literal [permeability](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ng1p5g/a_summary_of_all_current_research_and_opinion_on/) but the relationship between tightly curled hair and water, which is complex. I also couldn't help but think about the \"textures\" that are in the LOIS system, a system of hair typing developed in the Natural Hair community. The textures are very much about how water reacts to the hair. \n\n",
