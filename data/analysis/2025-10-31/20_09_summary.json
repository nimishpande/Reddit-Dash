Red, blotchy, sensitive, and covered in these tiny little bumps on my cheeks and forehead that would not go away.\n\nI thought it was my retinol, so I stopped. No change. I thought it was over-exfoliating, so I stopped. No change. I thought it was my diet, my laundry detergent, my pillowcase lol üò≠\nI was so fed up I decided to get methodical. I started a \"skin diary\" in my skincare app and my Notes app. Every day, I'd list the AM/PM products and take a quick selfie in my bathroom mirror.\n\nAfter two weeks, I was looking back at the photos. The only days my skin looked red and extra bumpy were the days I used my calming K-beauty moisturizer.\n\nI looked at the ingredients. It was packed with Niacinamide. I thought, \"No, that's supposed to be good for your barrier.\"\nThen I looked at my other products. My toner? Niacinamide. My Brightening serum? Niacinamide. My sunscreen? Niacinamide.\nI was layering it 4x a day without even realizing it. I was overdoing it on a good ingredient.\nI cut everything with niacinamide out. I bought the most boring, simple ceramide cream from the drugstore.\nIt's been 10 days, and the bumps are 90% gone. The redness is gone. My skin is calm.\nI'm so mad I was blaming everything else. Just because it's a holy grail for everyone else, check your labels, people! Anyone else sensitive to this stuff?",

I've been told by stylists in the past that I have lots of very fine hair.

If\nanyone cares to share any advice with me, I'd greatly appreciate it! \n\nMy routine: Shampoo and condition every other day (usually at night) with Carina\nOrganics Citrus Daily moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. \nLive Clean Weightless Volume Clean Air\nshampoo once a week or so. \nBatiste Bare dry shampoo in between wash days\nTresemm√© heat protection spray when straightening\n\nThanks in advance for any recommendations!\n\n",

      "content": "I don‚Äôt really know how much  scalp is ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù to show but I try to show as little as possible. The first 3 pictures are what my hair looks like on a good day. I tried showing my bathroom lighting as well as more natural lighting. As you can see it‚Äôs very frizzy. I‚Äôm told it doesn‚Äôt look good/could look better but idk how to style it cause whenever I try to style it like videos on YouTube or try methods I read from the wiki where you just scrunch it then let it air dry or use a diffuser then scrunch it after it just looks like my entire scalp is showing so I might be doing something wrong or using the wrong products. The last 2 pictures are what it looks like when I attempt that. Side note I was thinking of trying texturing powder. Now I think it‚Äôs gotta be how I style it cause I think my hair is fine but many people tell me it's thick but I personally think it's due to how much volumizing I do but there is the possibility of me just doing or using something wrong like I said.\n\nRoutine:\nI'll use this routine 6 out of 7 days of the week with the seventh day being my shampoo day and the only significant difference is I use ‚Äúhask argon oil shampoo‚Äù before everything else.\nI use two conditioners I swap between every other day. One I use is ‚Äúliving proof full conditioner‚Äù and the other is a protein focused conditioner called ‚Äúcurl smith multitasking 3 in 1 conditioner‚Äù and I‚Äôll just rake those in my wet hair. Then like I said I‚Äôll use the living proof one day then the next I‚Äôll use the other instead.\n\nPost shower:\nAfter the shower I‚Äôve tried many things but the most consistent thing I‚Äôve been doing is I‚Äôll use ‚ÄúKristen ess lightweight leave in conditioner‚Äù and use the praying hands method for apply that going mid to ends, then I‚Äôll comb my hair down with an oval brush. Then I use a small amount of ‚ÄúAussie instant freeze hair gel with jojoba oil and sea kelp‚Äù rub that in my hands apply from roots to ends raking in then scrunch my hair at the ends and shake my head up and down gently to make it more natural.\n\nDrying and styling:\nThen I‚Äôll sit and wait for it to be completely dry then scrunch it and my scalp will show really bad especially at the crown and hairline probably because of how short my hair is (due to being in the military I can‚Äôt grow it out so growing it more isn‚Äôt an option at the moment). After that I‚Äôll use a hair pick to pick at the roots to mid lengths to help separate them and volumize it to make it look like the pictures. I know that this is likely the culprit to my issue but I don‚Äôt know how I should style it otherwise as the alternative is I look like I raided a crack shack. \n\nAny recommendations on what I should do differently to avoid showing too much scalp but not creating so much frizz or any products I should try like texturizing powder and if I should replace certain products with ones you recommend?",

Lately i‚Äôve noticed these bumps appearing on my scalp. im starting to worry if this could cause permanent hair loss. Could my oiling routine (especially leaving onion juice overnight) or the heavy oils be clogging my scalp pores or irritating my skin?

I've looked into implementing a hydrating serum to combat any dryness caused from the BP or SA cleanser. For post acne marks I was looking at niacinamide serum to help with that and redness.

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n¬†\n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n¬†\n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n¬†\n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n¬†\n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n¬†\n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you‚Äôve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you¬†\n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I‚Äôm needing some hair advice/help! \n\nMy hair seems to be constantly oily at the root but very dry everywhere else, doesn‚Äôt grow very much at all, not shiny or silky, and on thinner side. \n\nFor some context: I do get my hair professionally done occasionally but it sometimes can be longer than 8+ months before I get the blonde highlights touched up and my hair doesn‚Äôt appear to be ‚Äúdead.‚Äù I just recently spoke with my stylist and she said my hair did not appear to be dead at all and seemed to be growing. Although I will say, I have been growing out my hair for over 6 years and it is maybe 5-6 inches past my shoulders. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúshort‚Äù but it is definitely not as long and thick as I would like. Also, I do use heat occasionally but not all the time. I will sometimes blow dry my hair- usually not even all the time. And less often, I will straighten it, but usually only on nice occasions. \nMy mom and grandmother, from what I saw, both had similar hair to me, so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs genetics or if maybe there‚Äôs some super products I can use to help! \n\nSo here‚Äôs a couple questions I have: \n1. How do I get my hair to not be so oily on the top but dry all around?? I hate having oily hair so I struggle not washing it in the shower and dry shampoo makes me feel gross- but I know washing less often will probably help this.\n2. How do I grow my hair to be longer and thicker?? Product suggestions?? Tips and tricks?? I want longer and thinker hair so I am able to do different hair styles and curl my hair without it looking so flat and like I am bold‚Ä¶ right now I practically ALWAYS wear it down  \n3. How do I get my hair to be shiny?? My hair always looks so dull and frizzy!!! I want shiny and beautiful hair!! \n\n",

These pics are what I‚Äôm currently working with and it‚Äôs been 6+ months since my last cut. My hair is quite thick and doesn‚Äôt look good just hanging down around my face so I wear it half-up pretty much every day just to keep it somewhat controlled, but I don‚Äôt like it that much. \n\nI want to go get a haircut that will give it a nice shape when down and complement the waves! Does anyone have any advice for what kind of cut would suit me? I have quite a square face so a style that softens that would be better.\n\nLast time I got my hair cut I asked for long layers and face framing but it turned out horribly - the guy cut these big chunks around my face that didn‚Äôt blend into my hair at all, imagine a set of stairs, that‚Äôs what it looked like. My fault for getting enticed by a ¬£25 cut. You can still see it a bit in pic 2. The hairdresser I‚Äôm going to this time comes recommended by my friend who has an absolutely stunning head of red ringlets so fingers crossed. \n\nMy current routine is Tesco citrus shampoo and coconut conditioner (don‚Äôt judge, I‚Äôm poor) but I just ordered the Aveeno rose water shampoo and conditioner as I want to see if sulfate free anti-frizz products work for me. I use Umberto giannini curl foam and then a small bit of Umberto giannini curl jelly to hold down the frizz, then let it air dry. Hairdryers / diffusing makes the puffiness/frizz a million times worse. I‚Äôve tried scrunching in my products vs smoothing them over my hair but I haven‚Äôt noticed a difference in the end result, the waves still appear in their usual pattern. I‚Äôve tried so many different methods and products over the last 2 years and this is the best I have found so far.\n\nSorry for the long post, I really really want to sort my hair out! My main question would be what kind of cut should I go for but if anyone has more general advice I welcome that too! Thank you in advance !",

      "title": "Dr Dennis Gross daily peel - universal vs ultra gentle",
      "content": "Hello!\n\nJust noticed that there were not any answered posts about the Dr Dennis Gross daily peels here and since I am an inconsistent user searching for some answers myself, thought I‚Äôd share my experience with you girlies ü•π\n\nSo they come in three types - ultra gentle, normal/universal, extra strength. I‚Äôve tried the first two types. Since I have sensitive skin I never thought of trying the extra strong ones. I would suggest to go for the normal one unless you have super sensitive skin (which I do) - then try the ultra gentle ones first.\n\nNow these are a two step routine thingy - steps are basically opening the pack and rubbing the cotton pad soaked in the essence on your face lol. So you wash your face, do first step (exfoliation), after couple of minutes do the second step (anti-ageing) and wait another two minutes before moisturizing.\n\nFirst off, yes, they are expensive. I have only gotten them by paying frens who have visited the States. But the only person I know IRL who uses them regularly is my best fren and she swears by it because she‚Äôs a PCOS girlie with angry skin. So I tried them and I am glad I did - even as someone who sucks at consistency, I do really like the effect it has on me even if I can use it for a few weeks on end. You can buy a ziploc pouch, cut each pad in half, and preserve the other half inside the package and ziploc for the next use. Cuz duh they‚Äôre expensive. \n\nSecondly, don‚Äôt start every day at first. Let your skin get used to it. When I used the orange peel for the first time I overexfoliated like a dumbass. Do it once or twice a week depending on how sensitive your skin is I guess at first. \n\nThird, don‚Äôt overdo rest of your actives. The peel pads contain Citric Acid, Lactic Acid, Malic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Retinol, Tocopheryl Acetate etc. Basically retinoids, AHA/BHA are already there in the peels so it might be wise not to use other exfoliants or strong acids in your routine if you‚Äôre using this! I didn‚Äôt realise this and coupled the peel with a cleanser that had AHA BHA PHA and my skin got so dry üò≠\n\nNext - ensure you use sunscreen! I can‚Äôt stress this enough. Because you _will_ get sunburnt if you don‚Äôt. I made this mistake once inspite of the packaging begging me to use sunscreen. Don‚Äôt be like me lol.\n\nLastly - MOISTURISE! The peel uses strong ingredients especially if you have sensitive skin like me so please for the love of god moisturise your skin girlllllll. I use 1.5-2x my usual moisturiser when I use the peel pads. \n\nAnyways, this was not a paid Dennis Gross advert lol. But I will try to be consistent and share the effects of the ultra gentle peel once I‚Äôve used it regularly for like a month or so. This is one of the only products where I‚Äôve felt a difference immediately after using it - almost feels like make up lol. The first set of photos is post using the normal peel and second set is using the ultra gentle peel. The rest of the steps were the same (washing face with a gentle cleanser like cetaphil then peel and then centella toner by skin1004 followed by bioderma sensibio pink moisturiser). Of course the quality of my skin is worse in the second set because the photos are taken months apart xD But I still wanted to share them for reference in case it might help somebody. ",

(when i absolutely felt like i had to, i would use rosehip seed oil.) but my actives weren‚Äôt really doing their job and my closed comedones would linger around for way longer than they‚Äôre supposed to. i‚Äôve used actives long enough to know how quickly they should be going away. once i added the honey balm, i noticed that some of the closed comedones started clearing faster, but others are still hanging around.\n\ni also have these weird tiny bumps on my chin that look like closed comedones (like right under the middle of my lips), but when i went to the dermatologist, she said they‚Äôre just normal texture that everyone has. they‚Äôre not super visible unless i prominently ‚Äúpush‚Äù my chin out, i don‚Äôt know how to describe it.\n\nso i guess i‚Äôm just wondering: ‚Ä¢ is there anything in my current routine that might be slowing down the turnover of those stubborn comedones? ‚Ä¢\tany other ingredients i should consider adding (or avoiding) to help with that? ‚Ä¢ any tried-and-true tips for under-eye bags or prevention of early aging signs besides what i‚Äôm doing? ‚Ä¢ any better ways to fade marks from cystic pimples? no matter how little i touch them, i feel like they ALWAYS leave something behind.

The intnetion was to slowly build up to daily use. I was expecting a purge phase with breakouts or irritation, which hasn't come yet. In fact I havent felt any kind of irritation. My skin feels totally normal. I've been using a sunscreen every morning too.\n\nIs it too soon to say i won't experience a purge? Secondly, would it be better for me to start using it daily from now, or is it too soon to decide that? I'm also wondering if the product is too mild for my skin and if I'll see any results with it.
