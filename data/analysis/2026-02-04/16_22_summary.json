      "content": "Ms Chetali Chadha is back to her old tricks again\n\nRoasting products because they have fragrance in one reel and in a different reel, sneaking in a paid promotion for a product that has not just fragrance, but also color. \n\nYou may have all seen that series the influence with chetali . It has been running for two months now.\n\nI always had a feeling that Chetali was carefully and smartly, putting in her paid promotions inside the reels while making it seem like a genuine informed information and today I got the proof\n\nProof number one in one of her recent videos, she has spoken about the best moisturizer for oily skin, and the Foxtale suncreen has been shown as a clear winner, however, if you have been following her series, you will know that she is dead against fragrance, and any other additives Foxtale moisturizer has both. \n\nIn her latest reel for dry skin moisturizer, she has failed Himalaya and Nivea because they use a particular ingredient that has been banned in the European Union because they use fragrance, however logic did not matter in case of Foxtale. \n\nLastly, if you see her reels, clearly she has done paid promotion for requil, formula RX and Be body wise without making disclosures by just making a point that she is giving them a higher ranking\n\nIt is very easy to figure out which product has paid in which product has not paid. If you just go and put a timer on the reel and see how many seconds she dedicates talking about a product that is paid versus what is not paid.\n\n Incase you don’t have context she has done it before in 2024 and 2025 always roasting products that have fragrance and then promoting the L’Oreal glycolic serum which also has fragrance but at that time it did not seem to make a difference to her because she was paid for it. Her values keep changing based on who’s paying her and who is not.\n\nI cannot believe she has come down to this. I was really liking her content, and it was seeming genuine and educated but now knowing what I know, it is terrible it really breaks my heart. ",

My hair dresser says I wouldn’t suit cool tones and he has been my family’s hair dresser for a long time so I trust his judgement though I did want a neutral tone. He uses 20 volume developer to lighten my hair then tones it. I complained to him that my hair looked too orange so he told me to come in a week and get it toned to a bit cooler color. this hair color looks different under different lightening and he told me too use purple shampoo if my hair looked too brassy but i heard blue cancels out orange and purple cancels out yellow. but in my past experience blue shampoo darkened my hair and i don’t want it to be darker. i am fine with it looking yellowish i just don’t want it to look orange at all. what do i do?

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I hate the wash because I don’t like other people detangling my hair. I recently had a bad experience where my longtime stylists of 8 years got impatient detangling and I was genuinely in so much pain and she pulled out a ton of my hair. And I don’t need the style because I hate these salon products anyway. They never leave my hair feeling right and I always need to restyle in a day or two. So what am I paying for??\n\nNow I would keep going to my stylist and just opt out of the wash and style and leave with the trim and eat the extra cost, but she just retired. And everyone in my area is charging $150-$250+ for a mandatory “new client education package” …… which I don’t need (I’ve been caring for my curly hair for 10+ years and I haven’t own routine)…. I need a TRIM.\n\nTLDR: Why do these stylists charge such a high entry fee into their services? And why can’t I just book a basic trim? Do I just know nothing about running a salon/being a hair stylist or are curly cuts really just a scam?",

In the last year vanicream keeps having quality issues and supply issues. Of course I’m open to other brands from around the world and USA but I figured I’d get the most new product suggestions (that I haven’t tried) hailing from Korea or Europe. I’m very interested in moisturizers and spf. If you have encountered SPF that is mostly or half titanium dioxide rather than all zinc that would be cool too (I know it’s very rare but my skin cannot handle zinc for now. Maybe a derm can help eventually but I’m not having much luck now, I think my barrier for some reason doesn’t like it since I guess allergies to zinc are extremely rare ). I tolerate the vanicream cleansing bar and vanicream moisturizing cream. Vanicream has simethicone in it and I seam to do fine but dimethicone in products and silicone heavy formulas seem to REALLY irritate me",

But either way I still comb my hair out if there is a alight bit of frizz at the top. I use a comb for curls and it works well! But my mum insists i need to brush it out. But today she did and now my hair is a frizzy mess. Theres a few curls but they aren't sitting right. \n\nSo recently ive started to treat my curly hair properly. For years I believed it was just wavy hair and had to keep brushing it because it was always so frizzy. Went to the hairdresser and they said I dont have wavy hair bjt curly hair and should start treating it better. So i started a routine:Tesco apple shampoo, Cien Uv protection ray shampoo, Cien conditioner hair mask, tesco apple conditioner. After I apply boots curl cream when wet and some oil before diffusing then I sleep with a microfiber cloth and my curls stay in. Everytime I wake up, my hair is still super curly and for once not frizzy but my mum goes on and on about how it is. She also brushes with such a force for some reason that I literally feel my head be pulled back. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice for this. Do I wait till the next hairdresser appointment and hint at it so she will listen to the hair dresser? She won't listen to me because im 17 and I apparently dont know better\n\n",

My hair tends to be all sorts of textures, like more wavy in the back and curly in the front, but I know it’s meant to be 3a, I’m just not taking care of it well since it just keeps getting curlier as I age and I was born with straight hair. I currently use a rice water shampoo and conditioner bar. Starting to notice that might be a protein overload. I brush it with a wide toothed comb to detangle. Afterwards I use the Marc Anthony Curl Defining Lotion. I then scrunch and air dry it. Perhaps I should be using a leave in conditioner or maybe a gel? I’m really not sure and need some help.\n\nWhat are some products you’d recommend and any advice on the hair care routine. Maybe I should invest in a silk bonnet? My goal is to have shiny, hydrated, non frizzy curls. ",

So either way after a week my eyelashes look wonky and i have to use curler and mascara to keep the straight lashes up.\n\nI’ve bought Tartelette tubing mascara but after using it my eyelashes go back to straight lashes after an hour or so. I still have to apply Etude lash primer in order to keep my eyelashes up.\n\nI feel hopeless as every mascara made for sensitive eyes makes my eyelashes drop and i feel like i look even worse then without it.\n\nCan any of you recommend mascaras that won’t clog my meibomian glands and keep my curl well?
