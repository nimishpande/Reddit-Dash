I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

      "content": "Ms Chetali Chadha is back to her old tricks again\n\nRoasting products because they have fragrance in one reel and in a different reel, sneaking in a paid promotion for a product that has not just fragrance, but also color. \n\nYou may have all seen that series the influence with chetali . It has been running for two months now.\n\nI always had a feeling that Chetali was carefully and smartly, putting in her paid promotions inside the reels while making it seem like a genuine informed information and today I got the proof\n\nProof number one in one of her recent videos, she has spoken about the best moisturizer for oily skin, and the Foxtale suncreen has been shown as a clear winner, however, if you have been following her series, you will know that she is dead against fragrance, and any other additives Foxtale moisturizer has both. \n\nIn her latest reel for dry skin moisturizer, she has failed Himalaya and Nivea because they use a particular ingredient that has been banned in the European Union because they use fragrance, however logic did not matter in case of Foxtale. \n\nLastly, if you see her reels, clearly she has done paid promotion for requil, formula RX and Be body wise without making disclosures by just making a point that she is giving them a higher ranking\n\nIt is very easy to figure out which product has paid in which product has not paid. If you just go and put a timer on the reel and see how many seconds she dedicates talking about a product that is paid versus what is not paid.\n\n Incase you don’t have context she has done it before in 2024 and 2025 always roasting products that have fragrance and then promoting the L’Oreal glycolic serum which also has fragrance but at that time it did not seem to make a difference to her because she was paid for it. Her values keep changing based on who’s paying her and who is not.\n\nI cannot believe she has come down to this. I was really liking her content, and it was seeming genuine and educated but now knowing what I know, it is terrible it really breaks my heart. ",

      "content": "First of all, I know everyone's acne is different and I'm not saying this will work for everyone, but I wanted to share my routine because I'm really proud of my progress (still not perfect) and maybe it can help someone. Also, I'm still figuring out what triggers my acne, so if you have ideas on what to improve, please share :)\n\nRecently my inflammation has reduced significantly and my breakouts have calmed a lot. My routine focuses on supplements, better diet, fewer skincare products (I used to overdo it).\n\nSupplements: I tried 15+ different supplements and ended up sticking with fiber (inulin) and a daily probiotic. These were the ones where I immediately felt an impact while other supplements didn’t have any noticeable effect.\n\nDiet: I never really paid attention to my diet but this has been a huge factor. I started by cutting out different foods systematically and learned that dairy really triggered my breakouts. It’s still hard for me sometimes to know exactly what foods are risky as a lot of them have hidden ingredients. Now I use a food scanner specifically for acne triggers and it seems to work fine.\n\nSkincare: I used to use like 7-8 products every day and learned that I was totally overdoing it. Now in the mornings I just wash my face with water, moisturize, and use sunscreen. At night I use gentle cleanser, ampoule, moisturizer, and scar cream (2-3 nights a week).\n\nThat’s it. If you have any ideas on what to improve, please let me know 🙂",

      "content": "hello! genuine question that’s been on my mind the last couple months: why don’t curly hair stylists offer just a basic trim service that doesn’t include a wash and style?\n\npersonally, I’m tired of paying $120+ for a haircut when all I need is a trim. I hate the wash because I don’t like other people detangling my hair. I recently had a bad experience where my longtime stylists of 8 years got impatient detangling and I was genuinely in so much pain and she pulled out a ton of my hair. And I don’t need the style because I hate these salon products anyway. They never leave my hair feeling right and I always need to restyle in a day or two. So what am I paying for??\n\nNow I would keep going to my stylist and just opt out of the wash and style and leave with the trim and eat the extra cost, but she just retired. And everyone in my area is charging $150-$250+ for a mandatory “new client education package” …… which I don’t need (I’ve been caring for my curly hair for 10+ years and I haven’t own routine)…. I need a TRIM.\n\nTLDR: Why do these stylists charge such a high entry fee into their services? And why can’t I just book a basic trim? Do I just know nothing about running a salon/being a hair stylist or are curly cuts really just a scam?",

I am on the pill and spiro to control it. I’ve done accutane twice now, the last time being in 2023. I tried tret in the past but that gave me wicked PD. For the whole summer I was doing pretty well on 15% azalaic acid but would still break out a little so I wanted to try differin. I heard it was less irritating than tret so less likely to flare my PD.\n\nOriginally my derm recommended azalaic acid in the morning and differin at night daily. I already knew that would be a hard no for me. At first I tried alternating (one night differin, next night azalaic, next night rest etc). After several weeks of trying to keep both and constantly dealing with barrier damage, I decided to quit all actives and give my skin several weeks to heal. I reintroduced differin once a week in November. Once a week caused minor peeling, nothing too crazy but by day 5 or 6 I’d always be breaking out again. I felt like 2x a week would be the sweet spot.\n\nI have been trying to increase to 2x a week since mid January and every time it seems to damage my barrier. I tried once every 4 days, once every 5 days. Pretty much once I break the once every 7 day mark, my moisturizer stings, the wind stings, I peel like crazy, my face feels tight and uncomfortable, and I way over produce oil.\n\nI really want to experience the magic of a retinoid. But I’m starting to think differin just isn’t for me. Any thoughts?\n\nRoutine:\n\nPrequel Glycerin Cleanser\n\nKrave Beauty Oat so Simple Cream\n\nHero beauty sunscreen (am)\n\nOn differin nights I use the sandwich method and wait until my skin is completely dry before applying. On extra dry nights sometimes I’ll add experiment beauty’s super saturated but I always break out a little bit after a couple days.\n\nThanks!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

But today she did and now my hair is a frizzy mess. Theres a few curls but they aren't sitting right. \n\nSo recently ive started to treat my curly hair properly. For years I believed it was just wavy hair and had to keep brushing it because it was always so frizzy. Went to the hairdresser and they said I dont have wavy hair bjt curly hair and should start treating it better. So i started a routine:Tesco apple shampoo, Cien Uv protection ray shampoo, Cien conditioner hair mask, tesco apple conditioner. After I apply boots curl cream when wet and some oil before diffusing then I sleep with a microfiber cloth and my curls stay in. Everytime I wake up, my hair is still super curly and for once not frizzy but my mum goes on and on about how it is. She also brushes with such a force for some reason that I literally feel my head be pulled back. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice for this. Do I wait till the next hairdresser appointment and hint at it so she will listen to the hair dresser? She won't listen to me because im 17 and I apparently dont know better\n\n",

My hair dresser says I wouldn’t suit cool tones and he has been my family’s hair dresser for a long time so I trust his judgement though I did want a neutral tone. He uses 20 volume developer to lighten my hair then tones it. I complained to him that my hair looked too orange so he told me to come in a week and get it toned to a bit cooler color. this hair color looks different under different lightening and he told me too use purple shampoo if my hair looked too brassy but i heard blue cancels out orange and purple cancels out yellow. but in my past experience blue shampoo darkened my hair and i don’t want it to be darker. i am fine with it looking yellowish i just don’t want it to look orange at all. what do i do?

      "content": "I have these dark circles under my eyes. I want to get rid of them, my skin is not light enough to cover them up truly but not dark enough to really blend in. I always wonder why can’t I have no dark circles under my eyes like everyone else? It’s bad enough that I got dirty blonde hair that’s flatter than Kansas with hardly any volume to it, having a pepperoni face &amp; body, having not straight teeth, then a not as noticeable widow’s peak (might as well be the new McDonald’s sign at this point), but then add eye bags &amp; dark circles under my eyes too?\n\nIt’s trash, add the fact that I’m also a picky eater to the point of having to take multivitamin gummies (thank you sensory issues). I’m also anemic too thanks to iron deficiency, which makes it worse. Not to mention, I have eye bags &amp; I don’t think that I can reverse that really, which is buns. I had these dark circles &amp; eye bags since I was 14 years old, they would pop out more when I’m sick, sleep deprived, or something along those lines. They only go away when there is enough light that’s the color yellow or when the sun’s there.\n\nWorse, the droopy eye shape that I have makes things worse, I look like a sick pitiful Victorian child in 2026 who begs for a thing of acetaminophen or motrin.\n\nIn my parents’ old pictures, my father didn’t have the dark circles, he had the classic blue eyes, brown hair, &amp; white skin combo, alcohol &amp; him treating me like crap aged him not very nicely.\n\nMy mother has more of a red tint to her skin, she’s skinny, taller than my father, &amp; she ages better than most people, when I saw what she looked like when she was my age, she looks infinitely better, no pizza face to be seen, no eye bags, to the point I’m quite jealous myself.\n\nI legit do not even know what to do, I did face masks, tried aloe vera sun gel, just got started with those acne face wash things after I got some for Christmas that everyone &amp; their mama would always see at stores.\n\nI wore sunglasses most, if not almost all the time when I was in marching band, I don’t sunburn a whole lot either, in order for it to go to my arms or anywhere visible except for my cheeks, parts of my face, maybe my neck or shoulders if I forgot to put on some on that area, I would have to wait for 3 to 4 hours for anywhere visible (except for my cheeks, parts of my face, maybe my neck or shoulders) to be sunburned &amp; that only happened twice (1st time, I was 13 at my father’s because cloudy weather &amp; beaches in GA don’t mix together. 2nd time, I was 15, I had no idea truly how long I was gonna be out there in the heat when the 1st annual powderpuff flag football game happened at my former high school, we were there for 4 hours, &amp; then I also went to Six Flags that next day because that was where our band trip was gonna be at back when I was a freshman in high school)\n\nI have no freckles in sight, just blackheads, acne, eye bags, dark circles under the eyes, I can get a gradual tan but I can burn (of course less severely than my siblings for sure), I still remembered when I was 11-13 &amp; I was jealous of my siblings’ freckles, their ability to hold curls, my older sister’s red hair, &amp; whiter skin. My skin’s so oily that it looks like the US government wants to invade my face. I picked at my face since I was 12 because my stepmonster would bring me to her bathroom to pick at my face for acne &amp; other blemishes on my face. I also rub my eyes when there’s some tears of tiredness or sadness on my face, so no one would see me or think that I’m crying. Christ’s sakes, I even have some dark facial hair above my lips that are growing, &amp; I’m AFAB (yes, I’m nonbinary y’all), I have to shave it off of my face. My eyebrows are bushy to the point that I can even see myself having a unibrow. I also got nerfed to the point I have a double chin in photos. My enamel is garbage because I was born premature 3 months too early like a piece of raw chicken. However, people do say that I also look younger, people sometimes confuse me for 14, 15, 16, or 17, even when I was 18, a waitress asked if I needed a kids’ menu while I was at Olive Garden with my mother &amp; stepfather. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhat the heck should I do? It’s quite a dilemma of mine, I don’t wanna look like a zombie because I ain’t supposed to be in a music video dancing &amp; looking like a zombie while zombie MJ sings Thriller &amp; puts it out on MTV for all of the kids to hear &amp; stare on TV.\n\nI don’t even have a clue on what I can truly do at this point. 🥀🪫💔🫩",

My hair tends to be all sorts of textures, like more wavy in the back and curly in the front, but I know it’s meant to be 3a, I’m just not taking care of it well since it just keeps getting curlier as I age and I was born with straight hair. I currently use a rice water shampoo and conditioner bar. Starting to notice that might be a protein overload. I brush it with a wide toothed comb to detangle. Afterwards I use the Marc Anthony Curl Defining Lotion. I then scrunch and air dry it. Perhaps I should be using a leave in conditioner or maybe a gel? I’m really not sure and need some help.\n\nWhat are some products you’d recommend and any advice on the hair care routine. Maybe I should invest in a silk bonnet?

The only thing I do for my face is to wash with a bar soap (a local brand of 10% sulfur bar soap that claims to be for the face) in the morning and night, and apply a tea tree oil moisturizer at night.\n\nPairing this with my bad habit of picking at the acne (despite knowing it'll scar) of course led to me now having a face full of acne and scars at only 19. Most of the old ones are dull reddish bumps, while some are flat. I assume that there's nothing I can do about them besides paying for a laser treatment. They look worse in person compared to the image due to my subpar camera skills. Recently, my temple has also been getting acne bumps that won't go away, unlike my cheek acne take would take time but still eventually flatten.\n\nI've been feeling rather self conscious due to all of this and have been hoping to improve my skincare (and hopefully reduce acne appearance plus scar with time). I would say I have oily skin for the T-zone? Is there any product anyone would recommend for me to start out with?\n\nUnfortunately I am the average broke college student, so I can't really afford a long routine with a bunch of products :( But I'm still hoping to get at least the basics down for cleanser, moisturizer, etc.",

I’m confused between these three: Juicy Chemistry Chilli, Horsetail &amp; Black Seed Hair Oil, Kama Ayurveda Bringadi Intensive Hair Treatment, and Inde Wild Champi Hair Oil. My main goals are a healthier scalp, less shedding, and visible baby hairs around the hairline and crown. If you’ve used any of these, could you share your experience—especially how they worked for hair fall control and new hair growth? Also, if you’ve used any other hair oil that helped you with hair growth, feel free to recommend that too. ",

I have sort of a wave pattern in my hair, but my ends are so damaged they won’t curl anymore. The mid-lengths of my hair have some wave, but not how it used to be. My hair used to curl up and wave while washing my hair in the shower, and when dry, have super defined waves on the bottom layer of hair and less defined waves or texture on the top layer. I told myself I wasn’t going to cut my hair until my birthday (April), but now I’m wondering if cutting the ends off would repair my hair pattern and overall look. I lifeguard in the summer, and would like to be able to not worry about my hair puffing up and getting frizzy without blow drying anymore. Right now my routine is a Pantene sulphate- free moisturising shampoo and conditioner, out of the shower I use a Garnier sleek and shine leave in to detangle, then Argan oil scrunched into my hair. In the photo, my hair is mostly damp, the ends are pretty much dry already. If there’s too much frizz in the mornings, I’ll blow dry with a brush. Most of the time I just brush through and leave it alone. I have a silk pillowcase, but that is all I have. \n\nAm I delusional that I have a wave pattern still or is there no hope? How do I fix this?\n\n(Apologies for the bad quality photo)\n\nThank you!!",

Everyone swears by something different, and it’s hard to separate real experiences from hype.\n\n\n\nFor some context: I have combination skin that’s gotten drier with age, and my main concerns are texture, fine lines (especially around the mouth and eyes), some lingering redness, and that overall “tired” look that shows up even when I am sleeping. I’ve tried a couple of cheaper red light devices in the past, and while they technically turned on and did the thing, I didn’t notice much change and the build quality felt pretty flimsy.\n\n\n\nRight now, I’m comparing a few options:\n\nUlike Reglow Red LED Mask\n\nCurrentBody Skin LED Mask\n\nHooga Red Light Therapy panel\n\n\n\nI’m torn between masks and panels. Panels seem more versatile (face, neck, body), but the mask is more convenient to use (I can move around while treatment) and fits the face better. I’m not expecting miracles or a facelift-in-a-box, just something that can help with skin calmness, texture, and maybe mild firmness over time.\n\n\n\nWould love to hear from others who’ve used any of these for a few months or longer. Did you notice real improvements, or was it more of a maintenance/support thing? And did one format fit better into real life than the other?\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n",
