      "content": "Actually, I often see people struggling with skincare and asking for help, so I thought why not share what worked for me based on my own experience and experiments? It might help someone.\n\nI attached a picture for reference as the final result, which is as accurate as possible. \n\nA few months ago, I started taking my health seriously. I began going to the gym and improved my diet. Skincare wasn’t even on my list, but as I focused on nutrition and fitness, my skin started improving automatically. Later, I wondered how much more I could improve it if I paid attention.\nPhysical activity helped a lot. I go to the gym, but you can do anything  running, sports, or any exercise that makes you sweat and pushes you a little. It contributes more to your skin than people think.\nI don’t go outside much, but for those who do, use sunscreen. Sun damage is real  I’ve seen it on my own skin. Prevention is always easier than fixing it later.\nI had blackheads near my nose and occasional pimples. During my research, I learned that excess oil can cause many skin problems. At that time, I was drinking over 500 ml of milk daily, so I reduced my fat intake. My thinking was simple  if I consume less excess fat, my body may produce less oil. It actually worked. Now I take about 300 ml of milk (mostly in tea) and roughly 35–40 grams of fat in total. Don’t reduce fat completely ,it’s essential just avoid excess.\nI also noticed that whenever I ate outside food frequently, I got pimples. So now I mostly eat clean home food and keep outside meals limited. Balance is important  you don’t have to eliminate it completely.\nI sleep around 7–8 hours, follow a high-protein diet with normal meals, and since I don’t eat many leafy vegetables or salads, I take a multivitamin to cover any gaps.\nMy theory was that the body can heal itself if you provide the right things and in my case, that turned out to be true.\nSo instead of spending too much money on skincare products to fix problems, try fixing the root cause first. Reduce excess fat, stay physically active, eat mostly clean food, sleep properly, and use sunscreen\n\n\n",

      "content": "Actually, I often see people struggling with skincare and asking for help, so I thought why not share what worked for me based on my own experience and experiments? It might help someone.\n\nI attached a picture for reference as the final result, which is as accurate as possible. \n\nA few months ago, I started taking my health seriously. I began going to the gym and improved my diet. Skincare wasn’t even on my list, but as I focused on nutrition and fitness, my skin started improving automatically. Later, I wondered how much more I could improve it if I paid attention.\nPhysical activity helped a lot. I go to the gym, but you can do anything  running, sports, or any exercise that makes you sweat and pushes you a little. It contributes more to your skin than people think.\nI don’t go outside much, but for those who do, use sunscreen. Sun damage is real  I’ve seen it on my own skin. Prevention is always easier than fixing it later.\nI had blackheads near my nose and occasional pimples. During my research, I learned that excess oil can cause many skin problems. At that time, I was drinking over 500 ml of milk daily, so I reduced my fat intake. My thinking was simple  if I consume less excess fat, my body may produce less oil. It actually worked. Now I take about 300 ml of milk (mostly in tea) and roughly 35–40 grams of fat in total. Don’t reduce fat completely ,it’s essential just avoid excess.\nI also noticed that whenever I ate outside food frequently, I got pimples. So now I mostly eat clean home food and keep outside meals limited. Balance is important  you don’t have to eliminate it completely.\nI sleep around 7–8 hours, follow a high-protein diet with normal meals, and since I don’t eat many leafy vegetables or salads, I take a multivitamin to cover any gaps.\nMy theory was that the body can heal itself if you provide the right things and in my case, that turned out to be true.\nSo instead of spending too much money on skincare products to fix problems, try fixing the root cause first. Reduce excess fat, stay physically active, eat mostly clean food, sleep properly, and use sunscreen\n\nI hope from this info someone would get benefitted ",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I also find that I have both very dry and oily hair at the same time (?). I get dandruff flakes often and it starts to look greasy on day two. \n\nI’m looking for any advice from anyone with similar hair types on what they have done to make it look more defined and to last longer. I’ve tried so many different products but I find they make my hair look stiff and greasy. I normally just towel dry by crunching and diffuse my hair and leave it at that. I’ve also tried different haircuts/hair styles but I haven’t really liked any of them and found that none of them suit my hair type, so if anyone has suggestions on good hairstyles too please let me know.

It worked surprisingly well.\n\n As a person from Bihar, this was not an easy decision for me to make to do it in Patna and not in Delhi or Kolkatta. \nBeing in Pharma industry , I met the doctor accidently and he was new in the city and was  confident of giving me excellent results, I trusted him and went ahead with the surgery. After 1 year, I can confidently say, the results are nothing short of spectacular.\n\n I had lots of doubts and fears in my mind before the surgery. However, from the very first consultation itself, the doctor and the whole staff were so caring and patient with me that all my fears and doubts slowly started to disappear.\n\nThe whole process of the surgery made me feel very safe and comfortable, and everything was explained to me in detail. The surgery was done slowly over 2 days , although it was quite long for my comfort.\n\n The support I received from the staff after the surgery was of immense value to me.\n\n Today, when I look at myself, I feel much more confident and positive.  This experience has really changed my whole outlook on myself.",

      "content": "This has never happened to me before until last week. I noticed a ring of dry, orangish, scabby skin on my face with an “O” shape in the center. I’m not sure if it’s ring work but I panicked and used raw African soap on my face, scalp, and body. After that, I applied 1% clotrimazole cream to my face and neck from the pharmacy.\n\nI’m unsure whether I should continue using my usual topical tretinoin or my Aestura moisturizer, especially since my skin is very dry right now.\n\nI’m feeling really scared and would appreciate guidance on what I can safely do in the meantime while I wait to see a doctor. I’ve already contacted my dermatologist and am hoping to get an appointment soon. I’m mainly looking for advice on how to manage this gently for now.\n\nThe only recent change in my routine is a new job that requires taking two different trains. One of them goes through central Philly and often gets crowded, with people standing very close. Sometimes I go to the gym before work. I always wear a mask, so I’m confused about what may have triggered this.\n\nI’m considering wearing more face coverage when I’m out and would appreciate any advice on how to handle this calmly until I’m seen!",

I need to be able to put my hair up for work. ive been doing twin braids for the last few days, but they get in the way and drag in the dirt while I work, so it isnt the best solution. \n\nany suggestions or tips from fine haired individuals on how to rectify this?\n\nI sleep with my hair in a very loose bun on top of my head covered with a large silk scarf.

I have straight hair and so does everyone in my family, so this is completely new territory for me. I’m white and my husband is Puerto Rican, so the curls definitely come from his side. I’m only mentioning that because I’ve read that curl type can matter for figuring out the right routine and I’m still learning how to identify hers. All the women in his family straighten their hair so they can’t really help me with a routine or figuring out her curl pattern.\n\nRight now I’m using the Shea Moisture Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, plus the Pipette Detangling Spray when necessary. After her bath, I towel‑dry her hair and go in with a wide‑tooth comb. On bath days her curls look gorgeous and defined. But sometimes by the next day the curls lose definition or everything turns into a tangly mess. Sometimes it’s just from sleeping, and other times it looks tangly and dry because she is teething right now and keeps yanking on her hair as a soothing mechanism.\n\nDo I need to be using some kind of moisturizer between washes? And if so how do I actually apply it?\n\nAlso is there a YouTube channel or blog that breaks this down step by step for someone who genuinely has no clue about curly hair care?\n\nAny tips, guidance, or things I should know would be super appreciated. \n\nThank you for reading this!

For a long time I would shower at night and sleep on wet hair. But the past few years I will diffuse my hair before sleeping. I am not loyal to any Shampoos or conditioners since nothing has won be over, but in the past year have used Shea Moisture, Curlsmith and currently trying Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle to try and solve the problem I am about to describe. \n\nNot sure when this started, but probably a couple years ago. I normally could go easily 3-4 days in between washes without any problems, but the past few years often the next day my scalp is so dry and somewhat itchy. And if I do scratch it, what seems to be dry skin (don't think it is dandruff based off my research online since that seems to be like thicker flakes??) appears everywhere and looks like dandruff. And if I wait 3-4 days to wash I literally am (sorry TMI) scrapping like a white film off my scalp while in the shower. My scalp also usually feels somewhat hot? So products that have an extreme cooling effect feel AMAZING while it lasts (went to Korea this summer and had a quick little hair treatment and they sprayed some sort of cooling product on my head and it was lovely and don't know where to find something similar, so if you have recs for that too, please list them). \n\nI have tried different shampoos or treatments based off of other Reddit posts, but they don't seem to make a difference. I should have kept a more extensive list but have tried Apple Cider Vinegar, Olive Oil treatment, and other random shampoos or scrubs that have been suggested. And tried a few different oils to put on my scalp overnight when it gets itchy. Not sure how long I need to test any of these out to make sure they actually work, but most I tried for like a month consistently. \n\nPlease help a girl out! what do I do? Any suggestions or tips especially if you have experienced the same problem. ",

      "content": "It's been my New Years Resolution to begin improving and embracing myself for only my eyes and self in general, but I've been struggling on where to start when it comes to being more feminine, which is something I've been wanting to achieve. \n\nOf course, as a kid, I was a cliche tom-boy, so the past few years I've been trying to navigate what feels like girlhood for the first time... but I'm really struggling. I wear jewelry, spray on perfume everyday, do my nails, shape my brows, attempt to grow out my lashes... etc. but nothing really makes me look or feel feminine. \n\nIm too shy to post myself here... but I was wondering if I could get some tips on some things I feel make me \"look masculine\"... or on just anything in general... to help me look and feel more feminine :)\n\n* My hair is thin, flat, straight and gets greasy practically the day after I wash it. I cut it into a poor shaggy wolfcut in late 2024... hated it ever since. I still have short curtain bangs that satisfy me just a little. Now it's more of a grown out layered... thing and I dont know what to do with it. I dont have it in me to style my hair everyday so Im not sure what haircut may fit me and my features best to move on from this. The longer it is, I feel slightly more feminine but I dont think it's really scratching the itch... and I've heard a good haircut is key to feeling yourself. \n* My face shape is kind of a slightly chubby oval-rectangle shape. Im overweight (Im working on it though! Big goal for 2026), but looking at my baby photos, I dont *think* alot of the weight catalogues on my face. Just, the shape sometimes makes me feel a bit manly... so Im hoping maybe a better haircut and some other adjustments would help.\n* My eyes are very round and my lashes are so short it kills me. Ive invested in a new lash serum, but Im anxious about any more under eye fat loss/darkness as I believe I genetically just have shallow under-eyes that definitely make me look more dead on some days than others. Ive tried vaseline and The Ordinary lash serum, but I didnt see any results. My eyes are also somewhat awkwardly close together ... I dunno if anyone can help with that but Id love any advice that might help them appear a little wider. Idk... all I want with my eyes is to look less like a toddler staring at you with wide eyes and more like an adult woman... lol\n* My brows are naturally pretty thick and dark, and recently I've consistently been shaping them... but Im thinking of starting over and seeing if I can find a shape more fitting to the rest of my features too. \n\nI hope I didnt overshare too much, I just wanted to see if I could give a good description of my face without actually giving a photo. I try not to criticize myself too hard... but I also want to improve my looks, you know? Literally any and all advice helps... doesn't even have to be appearance wise... I just want to look and feel my best from 2026 onward .. and I dont know where else to ask :-)\n\nI want to note I am an extremely low maintenance person and am not particularly interested in makeup unless absolutely necessary. Ive dabbled in mascara and lip gloss for when I want to feel the best... but other than that, Im not too interested. ",
