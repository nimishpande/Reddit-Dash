Sometimes I add a tiny amount of Les Secrets de Loly Curl Boost gel. I often let my hair air dry, but occasionally I use a diffuser.\n\nMy curls are light, shiny, and well defined.

It might help someone.\n\nI attached a picture for reference as the final result, which is as accurate as possible. \n\nA few months ago, I started taking my health seriously. I began going to the gym and improved my diet. Skincare wasn’t even on my list, but as I focused on nutrition and fitness, my skin started improving automatically. Later, I wondered how much more I could improve it if I paid attention.\nPhysical activity helped a lot. I go to the gym, but you can do anything  running, sports, or any exercise that makes you sweat and pushes you a little. It contributes more to your skin than people think.\nI don’t go outside much, but for those who do, use sunscreen. Sun damage is real  I’ve seen it on my own skin. Prevention is always easier than fixing it later.\nI had blackheads near my nose and occasional pimples. During my research, I learned that excess oil can cause many skin problems. At that time, I was drinking over 500 ml of milk daily, so I reduced my fat intake. My thinking was simple  if I consume less excess fat, my body may produce less oil. It actually worked. Now I take about 300 ml of milk (mostly in tea) and roughly 35–40 grams of fat in total. Don’t reduce fat completely ,it’s essential just avoid excess.\nI also noticed that whenever I ate outside food frequently, I got pimples. So now I mostly eat clean home food and keep outside meals limited. Balance is important  you don’t have to eliminate it completely.\nI sleep around 7–8 hours, follow a high-protein diet with normal meals, and since I don’t eat many leafy vegetables or salads, I take a multivitamin to cover any gaps.\nMy theory was that the body can heal itself if you provide the right things and in my case, that turned out to be true.\nSo instead of spending too much money on skincare products to fix problems, try fixing the root cause first. Reduce excess fat, stay physically active, eat mostly clean food, sleep properly, and use sunscreen\n\n\n",

Might use the pills instead. \n\nI feel that regrowth wise I’m not seeing too much. I was mostly balding around the temples and I’m still not happy with how they look, I’m showing the worst side here. Maybe I was expecting too much. \n\nOn the other hand I do notice that my hair looks healthier and thicker, so happy with that. \n\nI’ve had zero side effects, I had friends that took and became depressed but I’m noticing no such things, It’s like I’m not taking anything honestly.

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

I am wondering if anyone can explain to me scientifically the discussion and recommendation of not washing the hair until 48-72 hours after a color service due to the cuticle not being “completely closed”. I know cuticles dont work like blinds that just open and close. In my experience, washing 24 hours after color shouldn’t affect the longevity because the color doesn’t continue processing &amp; the conditioner seals with an acidic pH. I’m confusedddd",

      "content": "My skin is very sensitive and reactive, and I'm four weeks out from a trip to Mexico. Heat always makes my skin a lot worse, and unfortunately I'm a heavy sweater on top of that. I can't tolerate chemical sunscreens of any kind; they always result in allergic contact dermatitis, exacerbated by heat and sweat. Mineral sunscreens don't cause the allergic reaction but some still cause break outs under hot and humid conditions.\n\nAfter years of trial and error I think I've finally found a sunscreen that I can tolerate and that isn't miserable to wear all over: Dr.G Green Mild Up Sun+. It's a bit drying but it doesn't irritate my skin, rub off on my clothes, or feel gross. Hallelujah!\n\nNow for the next few weeks I want to shift to focus solely on barrier repair and strengthening so that my skin is in decent shape before it's being assailed by sun, sweat, heat, and daily all-over SPF.\n\nI think that means cutting out all actives and going purely soothing and moisturizing, but I'm not sure what products to use/not use and how to go about doing barrier repair.\n\nI have issues with texture, so anything that feels greasy or overly heavy and doesn't absorb well is a no. I'm honestly not great about using moisturizers in general because of this and because the inevitable sweating that comes from applying all over makes me feel like a greased pig.\n\nI have the following products at home already that might be suitable:\n\n* CeraVe hydrating cream-to-foam cleanser\n* CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion and moisturizing cream\n* Eucerin body wash for eczema-prone skin\n* Eucerin eczema relief cream\n* First Aid Beauty ultra repair wild oat hydrating toner\n* Nivea in-shower body lotion for very dry skin (I don't love this one as it feels a bit greasy after and has a strong fragrance, but it helps avoid the sweat problem)\n* Bioderma Atoderm shower cleansing oil (this one I think I will save for the trip itself)\n* Biodance bio collagen real-deep mask\n\nI occasionally get hormonal acne and pimple clusters on my forehead, and I have very visible pores that seem to clog easily, but besides that my skin is in okay shape. I don't want to put anything on it that will make those things worse.\n\nWill a routine made up of some of these be ideal? Or should I look to adding something more intense and better suited to barrier repair?\n\nSorry this is so long. Any/all help is appreciated!\n\n\\---\n\n**TL;DR** I need help choosing products and building a routine to heal my skin barrier all over and prepare it for upcoming excess irritation during a trip south. I have very sensitive and highly reactive skin; chemical sunscreens of any kind cause allergic contact dermatitis, and on top of that I get heat- and sweat-exacerbated irritant dermatitis and possibly milaria rubia (heat rash). Looking to do what I can now to minimize irritation during and after my trip.",

I’ve finally got clear skin a few months after coming off birth control but I’m really not happy it’s so dull and old looking. I also noticed I’ve got some really prominent forehead creases that have appeared which I know is due to dryness.\n\nAt pm im currently using a chamomile cleansing balm which my skin loves followed by the welda skin food nourishing night cream which also seems to be working with keeping my skin clear. In the morning I don’t cleanse as this was drying out my skin I just put spf and a vitamin c moisturiser on and my makeup on top.\n\nI’m not sure why my skins so dry as my makeup and skincare are the same so maybe it’s me not producing as much oil and hormones etc with no birth control honestly I got no clue. However I have heard that retinol is great for making your skin more youthful and healthy looking.\n\nI was planning to start simple and just add the ordinarys 0.2% retinol serum into my routine.\n\nI have no clue if this is a good product or not so please give me any advice or recommendations. Also looking for a new spf that is lightweight and looks good under makeup.\n\nThanks in advance for reading my post and for any advice!",

Constant small pimples/closed comedones but only in this area. It does feel like I have an odor from my chin as well but that could just be me being paranoid (I've asked others about this and they don't smell anything, but I do, and it's only coming from this area of my face).\n\nAll I use currently on the area is cleansing wipes (only thing that doesnt break me out, I know theyre not optimal). Azelaic acid for the acne marks/hyperpigmentation, and SA topical treatment for the active acne. Im afraid to even use moisturizer because I dont want to make things worse.\n\nHere’s everything I use on the rest of my face, which doesnt get nearly as oily and rarely gets acne:\n\n* Hypochlorous Acid Spray\n* Purito Oat Moisturizer\n* Paula’s Choice Azelaic Acid\n* Serious Skincare Olive &amp; Enzyme Wipes (Trying to switch to the cleanser by the same brand, issue is most cleansers break me out, hence the hesitation)\n* Nivea SPF 50 Water Gel (Japanese Ver)\n* Topical SA spot treatment\n\nI have a derm appointment, but its not for another 2 months, and this has been going on for awhile now. I do have fungal acne/dandruff, but this has largely improved with occasional dandruff shampoo washes. Ill try basically anything at this point if any has suggestions; masks, vitamins, etc etc. Any help/insight greatly appreciated, as I genuinely feel at a loss. Thanks.",

But they never look full or voluminous. It’s also so hard to maintain because everytime I wake up it’s a mess even though I sleep in a silk scarf with a silk bonnet on top. Please help. I think I have low porosity hair. \n\nSometimes it’ll be voluminous and sometimes it won’t. Should I even be using curl cream. Is it the haircut. The last picture was taken 9 years ago. My hair used to be so thick:( the first two pictures are with curl creams and gels and the ones after is mousse and gel only. \n\n\nROUTINE : Right now I’m using inner sense - I create hold gel, quiet calm curls, and inner peace texture whipped cream  and I also have miss Jssies, fenty curl creams, pattern beauty, ouidad and NYM. What’s the best for my hair? What I do is come out of the shower and soak my hair super wet again and then rake my products in and then seperate my hair and brush style with the bounce curl volume brush. Then I’ll flip  my hair upside down and use prayer hands for my gel and then scrunch and then use a microfibre towel to scrunch out any extra moisture. I then leave it to air dry for about 20 ish minutes and then diffuse. I don’t usually diffuse upside down because I don’t like shrinkage and I feel like when I did that my hair looked weird. \n\n",
