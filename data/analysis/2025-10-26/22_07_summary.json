After styling the whole head, i scrunch in different angles using mousse (Herbal essences, the red one.) and i use a tiny bit of gel as a finisher, glazing it and scrunching. (Etniker coco y linaza, the denser version.) I plop using a microfiber towel and diffuse with my head upside down, then i break the cast and separate curls using oil. (Oleo extraordinario, elvive.)",

Last month I switched to the Wishcare sunscreen because there was a lot of hype and then I heard a lot of bad things about Aqualogica, about them lying about the UV filters and stuff like that. So I switched to Wishcare sunscreen but just a few days ago the sunscreen scandal happened and I have also been seeing people debunk Wishcare as a brand about a lot of their stuff. So now I don't know what sunscreen to use and a lot of people suggested going for the Korean brand or the Japanese or the Australian brands but they are a little quite too expensive some of them and the quantity is also very less of the price that you are paying and I really want to make a switch of course for the better of my skin and I would really love that you guys can help me. I have been trying to find my answers for a long time but then every other person is just saying something else so I thought this is the best place to ask for advice and the Aqualogica sunscreen did really work very well for me but now I don't know because when I was an athlete like it didn't really help me with tanning I got a lot of tanned even while using the sunscreen in the right amount so I would really like it if you guys really really help me out here and I also want a new vitamin c serum because of Wishcare getting debunked so I don't know if I should trust them with the serum as well because I haven't seen any changes I mean I have dark circles as well and I have always had them since I was a kid and one thing I have want to debunk a myth where people say if you sleep less your dark circles get darker or you get dark circles which is so so not true it has been debunked by a lot of dermatologists and just don't believe in that so I really want to get rid of my hyperpigmentation around my nose and some of it under my eyes so when you guys recommend me a good vitamin c serum as well I really like my moisturizer even though dot and key has also been debunked but I still like my moisturizer my toner is very very well I don't know anything about plum I've been using the niacinamide serum for a long time and I don't know it is okayish I'd say it is okayish and same with the plum vegan mucin it is also very good I don't know what to say about the cleansing oil it has been good but it does make my skin's natural oil feel stripped away so if you guys can also suggest a better cleansing oil and please no korean brand  so please help girl out here I don't know where else to go at this point all the influencers are just lying any other creator who is reliable they also don't want to get into you know a fight because what if there's something wrong so please just help me out. I also don't use any retinol or retinoids, because I've heard that you should not use them without a Dermat's prescription or Dermat's proper guidance, and retinol should be used after a certain age, because it can harm your skin if you use it too early. Please also suggest a good under-eye cream. I've seen a lot of recommendations of this eye cream called Eye Bliss, but then I read a lot of reviews, and they were not good. Please suggest a good eye cream or any other brand.",

I've struggled with depression and during rough moments, my self-care gets sketchy.  I'm trying to make a new push to improve my skin/make the best of it and would love help.  It's so textured, and my pores are huge; it just crushes me to even look in the mirror.  :(\n\nThis week, I started this routine: \nVanicreme gentle face wash \nGentle exfoliation with a makeup pad \nSecond cleanse with Vanicreme gentle face wash Soo'ae Aha exfoliation pads (AHA/PHA) \nLaRoche-Posay double repair matte moisturizer\n\nI plan to swap an oil cleanser for the first cleanse, and have glycolic acid from The Ordinary that I've used once or twice, but I've stopped since it was making my skin a bit redder.\n\nMy skin has looked better, but I'm not sure if I'm on the right track.

The last two months I have started using sunscreen every day (Isntree mineral spf), added an extra hydrating step (Cosrx hydra power essence) and started double cleansing at night with a very gentle foam cleanser.

I‚Äôve had probably 3 haircuts in the past year‚Äî one to cut layers on the top (slight shag), and two maintenance trims to grow length but keep the shape.\n\nI don‚Äôt know if this is a normal amount of hair growth, if the cuts are affecting the entire length of my hair, if the color stunted my growth, if I need to be taking care of it better, etc.\n\nI‚Äôve been dealing with medical issues and every couple months I‚Äôll find myself having gone 4 weeks without any water added to my hair because I literally only do wash and go. The rest of the time I wet it (including washing, conditioning, stying, and 99% of the time air drying) once a week, seldom twice.\n\nMy normal routine:\n-Wash\n-Apply conditioner\n-Detangle\n-Rinse most of the conditioner out but not all\n-Cream and gel or mousse + scrunch\n-Air dry\n\nI don‚Äôt remember what products I used a year ago. Yesterday I used (this second pic is day 2 hair) :\n-Shea Moisture Curl and Shine shampoo\n-The Doux Honey Deep Conditioner, detangle with wide tooth comb, then rinse (immediately this time because it took like 30 mins just to detangle)\n-Scrunch out excess water but I have high porosity so it leaves a lot still\n-Apply The Doux C.R.E.A.M. (praying hands)\n-Apply The Doux Mousse (praying hands)\n-rake and scrunch\n-Air dry\n\nOther info:\n-I‚Äôm very overdue for a maintenance cut, I know\n-Hair is very dry by day 7\n-I am looking into a curly brush for the shower because I feel like it would clump the curls better and allow for even better distribution of product\n\nTL;DR: is this normal hair growth? Is there anything you‚Äôd recommend for my hair? TIA! üòä",
