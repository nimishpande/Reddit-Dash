      "content": "Heyy everyone,\nso I have curly-ish hair with some tighter curls in the front and waves near the nape of my neck. I also have fine hair, that's prone to breakage and being weighted down by products. \nIm starting to feel like its not worth the effort to do my hair routine since the curls usually end up looking terrible and it's easier just to brush and let it air dry where it usually ends up being half straight half wavy.\nI'm also afraid that I'm forcing my curls and I've deluded myself into thinking I have curly hair since everyone else in my family has curls.\n\nI use Pantene Curly shampoo and conditioner, and suave clarifying shampoo once a week. I section my hair into three sections (bottom to top) and use 1 pump of Umberto Giannini Curl Whip per section. Then I go in with Umberto Giannini Curl Jelly. First I scrunch with my hands, and then scrunch with a cotton T-shirt. \nTo dry my hair I hover dry with the diffuser and then when it's about 80% dry, I diffuse each side of my head while at a 90° angle. \n\nI've tried curl balms and creams but in my experience they just weighed my hair down and made it greasy. \n\nI just really don't know what to do anymore. It always looks stringy and frizzy and I usually end up brushing it out and putting it in a bun.\n\nI would be so thankful for any advice or suggestions!!\n",

      "title": "23 | High School vs University Graduation, thanks Finasteride! (~4 years treatment)",
      "content": "I’ve extensively covered my hair loss and hair recovery throughout my profile, honestly to the point where it’s been an obsession of mine lol. I have a ton of information as well as pictures at various stages on all my previous posts as well as throughout my comments if anyone wants to read through. I’ll give a brief rundown of it here.\n\nI started rapidly losing my hair when I was 16, I was somewhere between a Norwood 3-4 before I started treatment at 19. I had my head shaved throughout the end of high school as it’d look like the second slide if I tried to grow it out.\n\nWhen I went to university the same self esteem issues that I know a lot of you struggle with was hitting me hard too. I felt like an outsider amongst my peers because despite being the same age, I looked several decades older. \n\nI started taking 1mg of finasteride nightly in 2021 and have kept to that routine ever since. Initially I used rogaine as well, however as my hair got longer it became too much of a nuisance to apply. I stopped taking it several years ago now and never ended up losing any progress. \n\nThe only side effect I ever experienced was watery semen, but that stopped occurring so long ago now that I don’t remember exactly when, I’m sure I mentioned it in a comment somewhere. \n\nMen on both sides of my family are bald, and those on my father’s side all started losing their hair in the teens like me. Genetically I was screwed, but now I have better hair than all of the women. I have a hard time realizing that the pictures of me in high school are the same person I am now. I’ve ran into many people from high school who didn’t recognize me and then thought I was wearing a wig lmao. \n\nI’ve learned from here that I’m a hyper responder, I saw immediate regrowth within months of starting treatment and not only has that regrowth maintained, but it continues to become healthier, thicker, and longer. I sincerely hope that this treatment blesses all of you like it has blessed me. \n",

Has anyone had a similar white mark or pigment loss after a cold sore?\n\n\n2. Did it ever regain color naturally?\n\n\n3.

I currently use Redken mega curls (shampoo and conditioner) just because Redken used to work well for me when I had straight but I’m not super sure now.\n\nI after the wash I normally use a leave in conditioner (some australian brand my curl specialist salon had) on the ends and a Ouidad gel that I scrunch in and diffuse.\n\nThe results really do vary wildly sometimes it’s fine but if I get the timing wrong it can get a bit frizzy. I seem to have better results when I’m generous with the gel and get the inital scrunch and water content just right before diffusing.\n\nIn between washes I use a spray bottle with some water and just do a little spritz and scrunch and that mostly works but it’s definitely more frizzy then. Oh and the climate here is super damp pretty much all year round.\n\nNow for the questions: Is frizzy hair damaged or dry hair? As I mentioned I’m not quite sure about the shampoo and conditioner because I think maybe my hair is a bit dry but I find it hard to tell cause I’m not used to the texture. How do you guys know when your hair is dry? Any suggestions on shampoo and conditioner are welcome. I’ve seen a lot of mentions of clarifying shampoo, is that something that works for everyone? How often do you recommend? Last but not least are replenishing treatments like olaplex ok for curly hair? Are there other brands that work better for curly hair? I used to do this once a month for straight hair, is that ok for curly hair too?",

The problem is I popped this pimple 4 days ago (my fault I know) and it created a sort of bruise, pink-red in colour. The actual blood giving part of it is very small it’s mostly just like skin around it that’s slightly pink. I’ve been using aloe vera and Cetaphil moisturisers on it, but it won’t go. The bruise is sort of big and catches attention and I just can’t have it on my photo which is gonna appear on my exam results, my Student Government election voting photo, and a lot other places.\n\nHow do I get a fast fix for photo day? Foundation or concealer won’t work since makeup isn’t allowed in my school and in general it appears very very cakey since I’m not allowed to shave my face and naturally it sticks to the minuscule facial hairs.\n\nRight now I have products like a niacinamide serum but chatGPT told me not to use it. Idk what to do?",

      "content": "I suffered from a year-long acne mainly on my cheeks, which is now gone, but left acne scars. I went to a dermatologist and she prescribed me meds and an acne ointment. Used it for the time she recommended I use it, but there was no progress; instead, pimples kept coming, and they were a bit painful.  \nAt that time, I used to use Hadalabo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion, Shirojyun Premium Whitening Lotion, and Sana Namereka Anti-Aging wrinkle night cream.\n\nInitially I loved Sana Namereka since the texture of that cream was so buttery,but after 2-3days pimples started appearing and it made me stop. Even though I stopped using it, my acne kept coming and became worse, and this continued for a year. I don't even know if it was because of Sana Namereka, but I can't help but think that it might have caused it since I had no acne before that.\n\nSo, after I stopped Sana, I still kept using the two Hada Labo lotions not thinking that those could have been triggering my acne because my patch test results were good. No acne.\n\nI was also using the Melano CC essence before I started Sana Namereka but after using for 6-8 months I didn't see any improvement.\n\nAfter a frustating year,I used tret 0.5% and then only my acne subsided. Some acne comes through now and then before and during my periods,but they go away soon.\n\nFrom then on, I discontinued all Hada Labo lotion and the Sana cream I was using.\n\nTo get rid of acne scars,I bought 10 APLB Glutathione Niacinamide Sheet Masks, and after using one mask, I got two pimples on my face the next morning. I didn't think much about it because again the test patch came fine. The second time I used it, a few pimples popped up, and then I stopped using it.\n\nNow, I am using only COSRX snail mucin cream, Mary and may's eye cream, and my face is showing no major acne flare-ups.  \nI wanted to add in the anua Azelaic Acid 10 Hyaluron Redness Soothing Serum, and Dr Althea's vit c serum to help me fade stubborn acne scars. BUT I AM SCARED BECAUSE OF THE NIACINAMIDE IN BOTH PRODUCTS.  \nI do not know what caused me to have stubborn acne for a year that meds and isotretinoin could not stop. The patch tests do not give me any indication that I might get acne, so I don't really know how I can even help myself",

I’ve been keeping away from heat as much as possible for 1.5ish years now, and strands of my hair are beginning to look curly again but it’s still just wavy, frizzy and fluffy. Where’s a good place to start to try and revitalise the curl? Is it even possible? \n\nMy current routine is:\n1.  Homemade hair mask of an egg, natural yogurt and coconut or olive oil roughly every two weeks.\n2. Dove intense repair shampoo and conditioner, once a week I let the conditioner sit for 10 minutes before rinsing. \n3. Air dry as I don’t have a diffuser and want to avoid heat.\n\n\n I think a part of the problem is my hair is quite long (mid-butt length) so it’s weighed down too. Any advice is appreciated.:) TIA!",

I’ve always had clear, normal-to-dry skin, but over the past few months, I’ve started noticing acne-like marks and small breakouts, especially around my chin and sometimes on my cheeks. I also have quite a bit of facial hair, and since waxing doesn’t suit my skin and laser is too expensive, I started using a razor to remove the hair. I don’t get immediate breakouts after shaving, but ever since I started, my skin feels different — like it’s constantly irritated or not as smooth as before. Recently, I began using The Ordinary Glycolic Acid hoping for clearer, glass-like skin, but it seems to have made things worse. I used it carefully, once a week, followed with sunscreen, and only used it about three or four times, but still ended up with more irritation and small bumps. I’m not sure if the problem is from shaving, the glycolic acid, or something else entirely. I’d really appreciate any advice or suggestions from anyone who’s faced something similar or knows how to fix this.",

I had my weave taken out so I can get my hair to how I want it before getting a new weave. My own hair is in good condition. \n\nHow easy would it be to get it like the photo?
