      "content": "I was asked in another sub to post my hair routine, so here it is! It‚Äôs a little wacky, so I‚Äôll try to make it make sense. Also there is probably a better way to achieve what I‚Äôm doing, so if you have any tips please share! \n\n1) Cleanse with either Maria Nila Coils &amp; Curls Co-Wash or DevaCurl No-Poo Original. \n2) Gently towel-press dry with DevaCurl towel\n3) Spray some kind of sea salt spray‚Ä¶Maria Nila Ocean Spray is probably my favorite, but I‚Äôve tried lots that work similarly. Sometimes I use a gel instead during this step, but usually it‚Äôs the spray. \n4) Usually on my wash days (I typically do it in the evening), that‚Äôs it for my routine. I let it air dry, and then go to bed, and when I wake up in the morning it usually looks crazy/terrible üòÜ. I‚Äôve tried a silk bonnet, but so far I haven‚Äôt found one that is comfortable! \n5) In the morning, if it‚Äôs just been freshly washed the night before, I‚Äôll sprinkle Sexy Hair Powder Play around and then spray all around with hairspray. (Yes, I put the products on dry, crazy morning hair, before the next step). If not freshly washed, skip this step. \n6) With my curly hair towel handy, I tip my head into my bathroom sink, turn on the water, and soak all of my hair by cupping water in my hand and pressing it to my head, if that makes sense‚Ä¶this helps re-form the curls. \n7) Gently towel-press hair dry. \n8) I let it air dry while making breakfast for the kids and getting them ready for the day. \n9) Diffuse on hot low (my diffuser is from DevaCurl and I love it) until it‚Äôs dry. \n10) Sprinkle Powder Play, spray again with hairspray. Sometimes I‚Äôll diffuse again after hairspray. \n11) Gently rub a flat palm on the crunchy areas to break up the cast. Extra Powder Play and/or hairspray in areas if needed, to give extra hold/height/interest for that ‚Äúmessy‚Äù look. \n\nI hope that all makes sense! My hair probably looks best on days 3-5 post-wash. It gets easier to style as a bit more product builds up from previous days. \n\nIt‚Äôs been a fun year with my curls‚Ä¶I wore my hair long, bleach blonde, and straight for decades, and last November I shaved it all off. I‚Äôll include photos of now and before. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíõ",

Glycerin needs to be diluted, otherwise it can make your skin feel even drier. I diluted it in about 1:8 ratio (glycerin : distilled water)\n\nThe glycerin bottle cost me around 50, and the distilled water packets were rs.3 each.

I read that you shouldn't double up on exfoliant and retinol, but I haven't noticed any issues. \n\nShould I switch around things in the AM/PM routine? \n\nAlso, is there any glaring holes in my routine, especially for dealing with sebaceous filaments on my nose? I haven't noticed any issues but who knows maybe I'm doing something way wrong.

      "content": "Hello, posting the first time here. I have had dry, sensitive skin my whole life. Through a lot of trial and error I found only a few products that I tolerate (see 1rst picture) longterm. My hole grail is the green tea serum by Iunik. It does great in calming my skin however it does not do much in other terms. Bentons ceramide   cream was also great but is currently unavailable in my country. I have a lot of sabeceous filaments and my pimple scars heal very badly, leaving red spots that last for months. I tried acids (PHA, BHA, AHA) and nacinamide in various forms already (cleansers, peels, masks, serums) but none of them helped with the filaments and my skin responded with flares. So I tried acelaic acid as I have read it works for sensitive skin. My skin is mostly fine with it. If I use it like once a week. I also tried retinols for the deep pimples but my skin, again, only tolerates it like once a week max. So, my question is, if you have any ideas on how to improve my skin care routine, that does help with sabeceous filaments and deep pimples that does not make my skin flare up? \n\nRoutine: AM water, iunik green tea serum, g&amp;g happier barrier, haruharu black rise sunscreen\nPM BoJ ginseng oil cleanser, minimalist gentle cleanser, iunik green tea serum, g&amp;g happier barrier, wednesdays: inkey list acelaic acid, sundays: transparent lab gentle rejuvination serum",

      "content": "Hi! For reference I‚Äôve got very curly thick long hair that reaches my butt when sipping wet. this allergy issue has happened my whole life but worsening as I get older (I‚Äôm almost 20) and what happens usually on a regular day without going to get my hair done (which I haven‚Äôt gotten done in over a year b/c of this issue), consists of me sneezing at home for 3-5 hours everyday. Yes I take a ton of treatment it‚Äôs just I have allergies so severe.\n\nWhat happens when I go into a salon though and am exposed to all that hair, is like 100 times worse. I immediately start to feel itchy, then my eyes water, my nose starts to run, and then I begin to hitch until I start literally uncontrollably rapid sneezing, which makes it hard for the hairdresser who‚Äôs working on my hair, and I‚Äôve even been requested to figure out an alternative next time I get a cut somewhere. \n\nThe issue is a problem because I am in desperate need I feel of a trim and to get my hair done professionally. I have very very thick super curly hair and it‚Äôs past my butt when wet. I wanna feel comfortable in the chair even when I need to let the sneezes out or blow my nose but I don‚Äôt know what to request or how to handle it with a stylist. What would you do if you were in my position, or I was your client? \n\nMy routine consists of washing weekly, with garnier fructis shampoo and conditioner, detangling with conditioner in my hair while brushing with a wet brush, then after awhile rinsing the conditioner somewhat, and then once out of the shower I scrunch in Garnier fructis gel, then I let it air dry and then scrunch the crunch out. \n\n\nThanks so much!
