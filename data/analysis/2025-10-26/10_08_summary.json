I was using minimalist spf30(which I can't find easily anymore, anyway). I decided to go cold turkey four days ago to reset.\nNow, my lips are severely chapped, peeling, and painful. They feel dependent and I need to stop this constant re-application habit for good.\nI need quick, practical advice.\nWhat are the best, low-ingredient, non-addictive healers I can use very sparingly? Think single-ingredient moisturizers or occlusives. I want to heal, not get re-addicted.\nI'm considering the Kama Ayurveda lip balm as a potential, more \"natural\" step-down option (ingredients look like pure oils/butters/beeswax). Has anyone used this and found it less habit-forming than conventional balms?\nAny wisdom from those who successfully quit the balm habit would be hugely appreciated!!\n",

This case demonstrated it IS possible to regrow hair in areas where the follicles were suppossed to have \"died\" a long time ago due to the action of DHT although of course this occurrence could never be replicated (that we know) as to develop an actual cure for baldness. The video goes into more detail and the scientific sources that verify this story but I want to know your opinion about this peculiar case and what it could mean for future treatments that might alter the scalp conditions and actually regrow hair in previously bald areas (and yes PP405 is the more obvious candidate for such a discussion and YES we should not be generating immense hype about something we know next to nothing about). Needless to say I DO NOT recommend anyone burning their scalp at home to see if they get lucky and end up with a mane.",

I’ve always had clear, normal-to-dry skin, but over the past few months, I’ve started noticing acne-like marks and small breakouts, especially around my chin and sometimes on my cheeks. I also have quite a bit of facial hair, and since waxing doesn’t suit my skin and laser is too expensive, I started using a razor to remove the hair. I don’t get immediate breakouts after shaving, but ever since I started, my skin feels different — like it’s constantly irritated or not as smooth as before. Recently, I began using The Ordinary Glycolic Acid hoping for clearer, glass-like skin, but it seems to have made things worse. I used it carefully, once a week, followed with sunscreen, and only used it about three or four times, but still ended up with more irritation and small bumps. I’m not sure if the problem is from shaving, the glycolic acid, or something else entirely. I’d really appreciate any advice or suggestions from anyone who’s faced something similar or knows how to fix this.",

      "content": "Reddit\n\nSooooo, I just need honest feedback. I have had long hair my ENTIRE LIFE. Been going to my hair stylist for like 5 years. Have never had anything to complain about before. I normally do a refill on my highlights. I did tell her I wanted to go a tiny bit more blonde than before. Today I just had a bad feeling when she started putting the bleach on. \n\nI felt she was rushing. (She does doubles all day) She also seemed to be putting bleach on parts of my hair that were already blonde and I know that is a no-no. I tried to shrug it off and trust her. Bleaching is done. Says she is going to put me under the dryer for 15 minutes. I asked if she wanted me to set my timer. She said “No I’ll be back.” \n\nAt almost 15 minutes I decided to take myself out of the dryer (again, bad feeling) and let her and her assistant know I was going to the bathroom, then sat back down by the dryer but didn’t go back under it. When her assistant finally came and got me around 25 minutes total time she had a panicked look on her face like “uh oh, we left you under for too long.” Thank god I’m always paranoid of breakage and didn’t go back under the dryer. \n\nAssistant then checked my foils and the stylist comes over and assistant says “pure white”. Stylist says “perfect! And I’ll bring a hair mask over to the wash bowl” goes back to her booth then assistant takes me to the wash bowl. (Stylist never comes back with the hair mask btw) Everything was fine with the wash but I did feel the toner couldn’t been left on a little too long and the assistant was talking to another staff a little too much for my liking while the toner was sitting on my head. \n\nWe go back to booth. Someone is in stylist chair (nbd) assistant takes towel off my head and I tell her, we are going to need a lot of detangler, she then asks “do YOU want to comb your hair out so I don’t hurt you” and that’s fine because I generally do prefer to comb out my own hair because it’s so long I can just get through it faster. \n\nWhen I first start combing it out I instantly notice something is wrong. My hair is falling out in clumps. In brushfuls. It is worse than any other hair breakage from bleaching I have ever had. And listen, I’ve had my hair bleached for many years and am used to a small small handful of bleached hair coming out but this was ALOT of hair. (The photo doesn’t do it justice.)\n\nI called stylist over and showed her and she downplays my concerns! “It looks like more than it is, and as long as it’s not breaking from the top it’s fine.” Then her assistant chimes in “and you’re cutting a few inches off anyway right? So that will make it so it’s not so bad.” I am internally saying “WTF?” And holding back tears while I continue to pull small clumps of hair from my head and add it to the pile of my hair that has already come out. \n\nI was going to get a trim and blow dry but I was trying not to cry and was so upset that I asked assistant to just let me know the total so I can go. Mind you, this whole time stylist is busy speaking to and working on another client. Assistant tells stylist I want to leave and don’t want my trim anymore. Stylist mentions something about sending me home with a hair mask. I pay and leave (with no hair mask btw and start crying as soon as I get in my car. \n\nAm I overreacting?? I felt like they both tried to minimize my concerns and no apology was given, no real conversation was had, no care seemed to be had by either of them. I don’t know if stylist just didn’t want to address it because she had 2 other clients right there but to tell me “it’s not that much hair” and then I pick up the whole pile and say “this is a lot of hair.” She then says “It is, a little bit.”\n\nDo I have a right to be offended? I also was expecting a phone call or text or something from stylist but got nothing. I don’t even know what to do. Don’t know if I should go back to her because of how I was brushed aside. I just need advice please. Thanks in advance and sorry about this novel.",

I also noticed I don't really think about my hair anymore, I was going crazy for like 2 years before that and was very self-conscious but that kinda disappeared, not sure if it's because of actual progress or just because \"I'm doing what I can\".\n\nI've been using fin 1mg for a year now pretty consistently (M/W/F) and minox 5% on and off because I'm lazy",

Honestly, I think they’ve been there for a long time but maybe they were not so visible. I noticed that my teen sister also has this problem (she is 15 and I am 27).\nMy skincare routine is pretty simple: a gentle face wash, serum, moisturizer, and SPF during the day. Is there anything I can do to minimize the appearance of these pores?\n\nFor context, I’ve also been using Epiduo Forte for about two weeks to treat some breakouts on my cheeks and chin.\n\nThanks so much for any advice!",

I had what I thought was a milia under my eye, but have since realized it’s a tiny pimple. Except it’s on the delicate skin under my eye. I tried popping it earlier using my fingers, but it didn’t work and I don’t want to damage that area. I have extractor tools but I’ve never successfully used that and it seems that’s best on stronger facial skin. Help?\n\nThank you!",
