      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I went to get a pedicure today because my feet have entered the “absolutely not” phase of winter neglect. I just wanted peace, warm water, and to pretend for one hour that my life was together.\n\nInstead, I walked straight into a nail-salon version of a telenovela.\n\nThere were two women at the station next to me having what I can only describe as a highly strategic debate over French toe nail designs. One of them wanted something classic and subtle; the other wanted glitter, rhinestones, and possibly a tiny painted Eiffel Tower. The nail tech looked like a referee who had already seen too much.\n\nMeanwhile, a guy a few seats down was getting his first-ever pedicure because, in his words, “I’m tired of my toes looking like they’ve survived a war.” He kept nervously asking, “Is this supposed to tickle or is this just me?” and the whole salon kept reassuring him like it was a group therapy session.\n\nThen came the real chaos: One of the debating women pulled up inspiration photos on her phone, but half her screenshots were questionable product pics from random shops and bulk listings, including some that looked very clearly like they’d been copied from Alibaba years ago. The nail tech stared at the images like she was being asked to replicate a mythological creature. Finally they settled on a design that neither involved Eiffel Towers nor rhinestone explosions, and peace returned.\n\nMy pedicure itself was great, but honestly the best part was the pure human drama unfolding around me. Nail salons are like tiny portals into people’s personalities. You learn who’s indecisive, who’s dramatic, who’s weirdly intense about cuticle care, and who’s just here to vibe.",

      "content": "Hi! This is my first post here. I am wondering how I can go about fixing the skin on my nose, specifically on the sides.\n\nI'm currently 22, and when I was 13 I heavily damaged the skin on the sides of my nose by dragging a metal pimple popper along my skin to push out all the sebaceous filaments, regularly. I didn't know what they were back then. My nose skin literally used to flake off from the damage 😭\n\nI haven't done that kind of damage in years, but I've never really been able to recover from it. I left a lot of scars/dilated pores behind, and a lot of them produce those larger white dots as you can see. Removing the white dots does not help, they come back, and they leave a hole when I take them out which doesn't seem good. They aren't white heads, but I don't know what they are - definitely not regular pimples by any means. If anyone can tell me a name for them that would be great! The other side of my nose is similar, but slightly less damaged.\n\nThank you so much for any advice you may have!\n\nThe rest of this is just more context that might be useful for you:\n\nSkin care history: I have done some mild skin care in the past, I tried using the salicylic acid cleanser by cerave for a bit when I was 19. I may have been using it incorrectly though because my skin didn't seem to enjoy it much (I was using it like everyday... and I'm pretty sure that is incorrect). I have also tried oil gritting before and it seemed alright, but I did end up stopping.\n\nCurrent skin care: I use cerave moisturizer mostly every day, usually after I take my makeup off with garnier micellar water. Those are the only two skin care products I'm currently using on my skin, besides sunscreen occasionally (la roche posay). I do wear makeup, not a lot on my acne prone areas though, just a bit of powder foundation, which hasn't seemed to make any changes in the amount of acne I have.\n\nBehaviour of my skin: I think generally my skin has reacted best when I try to leave it alone, it seems to become agitated when I use skin care but I think that is mainly the result of improper research and understanding of how to use it.\n\nI also think my skin is very acne prone so gentle products are likely the best solution for me. I know this post is about my nose specifically but my chin, forehead, and the apples of my cheeks all get acne too.",

      "content": "I (30F) have been struggling with acne recently. I usually have fairly clear skin, except for general teen acne when I was about 12-14 and fungal acne when I was 21-22. I took care of my fungal acne with the help of an online blog made by F.C. (iykyk). A few months ago I was on two rounds of antibiotics to get rid of an H. Pylori infection. It finally worked, but my face started breaking out and hasn’t gone back to “normal.” While on the antibiotics, I noticed my seborrheic dermatitis had gotten worse so I washed myself from head to toe with Selsun Blue (medicated) for about 2 months, including my face. I thought my fungal acne had returned since I had killed all the good skin bacteria that was maybe keeping the fungus in check, but I’ve been using fungal safe products for years already. Naturally, I thought this new acne was because of the imbalance in my gut bacteria since I had just killed them all, but it has been months of kefir or kombucha every morning on an empty stomach and nothing. I still break out all over my face, but mostly my T-zone. I switched from lactose free milk to oat milk and kefir to kombucha thinking maybe it was the dairy. Nothing. My skin routine is fairly basic, as follows:\n\nMorning- wash with Vanicream, apply Malezia benzoyl peroxide gel, then urea moisturizer. (I don’t use sunscreen, I know I’m supposed to, please don’t come for me)\n\nNight- wash in shower with Happy Cappy medicated baby shampoo, then moisturize with Cerve baby moisturizing cream with retinoid mixed in (0.1% HPR). \n\nWhen I wear makeup, which is not often, I take it off with Garnier micellar water (blue) and then wash my face with happy cappy and a silicone scrubber. When I’m outside in the summer, I wear Cotz face prime &amp; protect tinted SPF40. Sometimes I’ll use the ordinary AHA + BHA peeling solution, but that is only recently because I’m trying everything I can. I wash my towels and pillowcase with my sheets every 2 weeks, and flip the pillow after a week. I wash my head every other day and try to keep my seb derm in check. I have also been trying to lose a bit of weight, so I’m eating healthier home-made meals and working out 4-5 times a week. I try to limit overly processed foods. It really feels like the issue is coming from inside, not external bacteria or products, but I don’t know how to fix it. Part of me thinks it’s a change in hormones, like my body is “angry” that I haven’t birthed a child, or maybe I had the H. Pylori infection for so long that all my hormones were balanced because of it, and now that it’s gone, this is my new norm? Has anyone else experienced this? As much as I hate to admit it, my appearance is really something that holds a lot of weight toward my self worth, and this has been emotionally challenging for me. Please help!",

      "content": "I have seborrheic dermatitis which inflames and irritates my skin, but I also have what I think is very oily skin. I started using medicated shampoo about 10 months ago regularly - 2-3x times a week and it's made a significant different on my forehead. The little bumps of what seemed to be acne are gone and it's pretty smooth and overall much less red. I was advised to switch to products that have eczema labels or similar. I switched the products I was using about the same time and noticed an improvement in clearing my skin bumps. Yet, I still have excessive oil on my nose, cheeks, and chin and I am constantly wiping my face throughout the day when I don't wear make-up. My nose and cheeks are also super red and feel irritated without make-up. When I wear make-up, it feels like relief for my skin and still have to dap oil but only like 2 or 3 times versus every hour without it.\n\nI know that I have reactions to certain foods and diligently avoid them. I'm curious if anyone has similar skin characteristics and have found some sort of success/improvement in reducing oil and redness? My current skin care routine is simple...\n\n* AM: facewash- panoxyl 2-3x per week whenever I use the medicated shampoo; switch between Tula Cult Classic Cleanser and La Roche-Posay; toner - Urban Skin Rx Witch Hazel Toner\n* PM: La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ Cleansing Oil\n* Lotion: switch between La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Matte Moisturizer and Vichy Mineral Moisture Matte Sorbet\n\nI can't use retinoid or similar products as it irritates my skin. I stopped using Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant because I couldn't tell if it was doing much of anything.\n\nI was also considering Red Light Therapy as I've been reading it's supposed to also help with oil control? Anyone have similar experiences or any recommendations for less oil? TIA!",

      "title": "How to Smell Fresh Without Perfume or Chemicals",
      "content": "\nYou know that one person who always smells good, not too strong, not too floral, just effortlessly fresh? Yeah, we’ve all met someone like that and secretly wondered, how do they do it?\n\nLet’s be honest - smelling good all day isn’t always easy. Between the heat, long commutes, workouts, and everything in between, staying fresh can feel like a full-time job. And while perfumes and chemical-loaded sprays might give you a quick fix, they rarely last beyond a few hours. Some even make things worse; irritation, dryness, or that overly “artificial” scent that fills the whole room.\n\nSo, how do you smell fresh without all the chemicals and strong fragrances? Turns out, the answer is simpler, and a lot more natural - than you think.\nAre There Ways to Smell Fresh All Day Naturally?\nYes. And no, we’re not talking about dousing yourself in body mist every two hours. Here are a few simple home remedies and lifestyle tweaks that genuinely help:\n\n1. Hydration is underrated.\nDrinking enough water helps your body flush out toxins — and yes, that affects how you smell. When your body’s hydrated, your sweat is less concentrated, meaning less odor.\n\n2. Keep it clean (literally).\nA gentle, pH-balanced body wash can go a long way in preventing bacteria buildup — the real cause behind body odor.\n\n3. Choose breathable fabrics.\nCotton, linen, and bamboo fabrics allow your skin to breathe, reducing moisture and bacterial growth.\n\n4. Eat light and clean.\nStrong-smelling foods like garlic or heavily spiced curries can actually change how your body odor develops. Balanced meals = balanced scent.\n\n5. Try natural odor control.\nIngredients like baking soda, coconut oil, and yes, phitkari (alum) have been used for centuries to control odor naturally.\n\nThe Problem With Chemical-Based Deodorants\nHere’s the thing; most deodorants and perfumes don’t fix odor. They just cover it.\n\nThe typical deo you’ll find on a store shelf is packed with chemicals that block pores or mask smell for a short time. Some contain alcohol or harsh compounds that dry out your skin, leading to irritation or darkening over time.\n\nAnd when you think about it, spraying layers of chemicals on your skin every single day isn’t exactly “fresh.”\n\nThat’s where a shift is happening. People are now choosing chemical free deodorants and alcohol free deodorants — products that work with your body, not against it.\nMeet Phitku: India’s No.1 Crystal Roll-On\nNow, let’s talk about what’s actually changing the game.\n\nPhitku’s Crystal Roll-On is not your typical deo. It doesn’t rely on overpowering scents or temporary freshness. Instead, it targets the real cause of body odor — bacteria.\n\nThis roll-on uses phitkari, or alum crystal — nature’s oldest and most trusted antibacterial mineral. For generations, alum has been known to cleanse, tone, and purify skin. Phitku brings that same time-tested wisdom into modern underarm care.\n\nUnlike regular deodorants, this one doesn’t clog your pores or interfere with sweating — because sweating is your body’s natural way of cooling down. What it does is prevent bacteria from thriving, which means no odor, even when you sweat.\n\nAnd here’s the best part - it’s chemical-free, alcohol-free, and 100% natural.\nNo harsh ingredients, no stickiness, no stains. Just pure, clean freshness that lasts almost three times longer than your regular deo.\n\nWhy It Works (Even Without Perfume)\nPhitku’s formula is built around one simple truth: you don’t need to smell like a perfume counter to smell good.\n\nHere’s why it stands out:\n\n1. Targets Bacteria, Not Sweat\nBody odor happens when sweat meets bacteria. Phitku controls that bacteria naturally.\n\n2. Gentle on Skin\nNo irritation, no dryness, and suitable for sensitive underarms.\n\n3. Fragrance-Free Freshness\nYou’ll feel fresh; not perfumed. Perfect for both men and women.\n\n4. Sustainable and Safe\nMade with earth-friendly ingredients that care for your skin and the planet.\n\n5. Lasts Longer\nSince it neutralizes odor at the root, it lasts much longer than most chemical sprays.\n\nSo whether you’re heading to the gym, a long day at work, or just running errands, Phitku has your back (and your underarms).\n\nWhy You’ll Love Making the Switch\nOnce you go natural, you realize how much better your skin feels. You’re not covering anything up; you’re preventing odor before it even starts.\n\nA chemical free deodorant like Phitku doesn’t just give you freshness; it gives you peace of mind. You’re not constantly reapplying, worrying about stains, or wondering if your deo’s too strong.\n\nPlus, it’s totally gender-neutral, compact, and eco-friendly. So whether it’s your gym bag, work drawer, or travel pouch - it fits right in.\nFinal Thoughts: Freshness Redefined\nWe live in a world where smelling good often means spraying chemicals that overpower everything else. But real freshness isn’t loud; it’s clean, subtle, and lasting.\n\nPhitku’s Crystal Roll-On brings that kind of freshness back. Rooted in nature, powered by science, and trusted by generations; it’s the new definition of clean.\n\nSo, if you’ve been searching for something that keeps you truly fresh without perfumes or chemicals, this is your sign.\nGo natural. Go gentle. Go Phitku.\n\nBecause smelling good shouldn’t mean hiding behind fragrance - it should mean feeling fresh, confident, and completely yourself.",

But currently my routine is Rizos hydrating shampoo, SheaMoisture Hydrate &amp; Repair conditioner, LUS curls styling product while still in the shower so my hair is sopping wet, brush with an Olivia Garden brush to get some curl clumps, and LUS Irish sea moss gel on top of that, again while still in the shower.
