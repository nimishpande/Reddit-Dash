      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I’ve recently bought an LED light mask which comes with red light (anti-ageing), near infrared light (pore refinement), yellow light (brightening), and blue light (acne) settings. \n\nThe recommended treatment times are 3 x week, 10 mins for the red light, 2 x week, 20 mins for blue light, 3 x week, 20 mins for yellow light, and 3 x week, 10 mins for the near infrared light. \n\nI want to use all of these modes but spending over 2.5 hours each week with an LED mask on seems like a lot. Is there a maximum recommended amount generally? \n\nAm I approaching this correctly by doing them all together, or should I be alternating (6 weeks doing the recommended routine for red light, then switching to yellow etc), or something else entirely? Does anyone have any experience with at home LED masks? Or even better, specifically with the BeautyPro Photon LED mask. \n\nI feel like I should alternate days because each colour has different skincare recommendations (I’m thinking Vitamin C on the red and/or near infrared days, salicylic once a week on the blue days, and a hydrating moisturiser on the other days), but I’m open to suggestions on that too as it’s just some recommendations from the box. Niacinimide irritates my skin but I’ve never had another ingredient cause problems and I’ve tried plenty. \n\nI’m a mid thirties woman with quite uneven skin tone, some thread veins and burst blood vessels, a little bit of sun damage, and blackheads with occasional spots (maybe 2-3 per month). I’m concerned mainly with even skin tone and anti-ageing. Thanks for any advice you can offer! ",

I asked to go a lighter dark brown to match my roots with some dimension in the ends and it is neither of those things. 😂 she told me to use a clarifying shampoo if I want to lighten it up but obv it’s gonna take more than that; so does anyone have suggestions?\n\nI have lightened my hair and colored it for yearssss but decided to treat myself and go to a salon this year. I’m willing to do some work myself if anyone has recommendations, but also willing to go pay a shit ton of money to a seasoned stylist if that’s what it will take 🤷🏻‍♀️ I don’t *hate* this color but after being so dimensional for years it’s hard to go all over dark all at once.

I wash my hair every day (which is 100% not a problem for me and not something I wish to change). I don’t style it often, because as of my current style, putting in effort can only make it look somewhat decent, rather than actually nice. It feels like kind of a waste. I’d rather have a haircut that either looks incredible styled but makes me look like a swamp dweller when unstyled, than a cut that always looks kind of meh. \n\nI’m not opposed to going shorter. I’m also pretty sure I want to do side bangs like the last photograph, since I think my face shape works well with a side part. \n\nAnyway—I wash every day, and styling isn’t much of an issue for me. I use good products for my hair, and I haven’t had split ends in probably at least a year. I get trims and practice good habits. I just have like… almost no sense of style lmao. I tried to include my glasses for reference as well. I’ve been considering getting glasses like in the first inspiration photo because I like rimless glasses far more, but can’t find any near me (live in buttfvck nowhere). \n\nAny advice? Even if it’s just, “definitely don’t do x” or “y would work with your face shape” ",

I use the same routine except i use a mousse now. My hair doesn't hold curls like it used to. Only the ends are super curly. Am i lacking moisture? Do i need to add a hair mask? Parts of my hair like the back top and the sides by my ears are more coarse and don't hold curls. They just become frizzy S curls. If i do my hair i always get thick sections that never soak up water or dry well no matter if i brush style or finger curl. I don't like volume because i have so much hair and it gets hot. Please help me if you can. \n\nI have high porosity hair. Also don't mention any unevenness lol i cut my own hair.\n\nROUTINE: \nShampoo and conditioner: Marc anthony 3x moisture \nLeave in: As I am Leave in \nCream: Miss Jessie's Multicultural curl cream\nGel: Camille Rose Curl Maker \nMouse: Doux Def Texture Mousse \n\ni wet my hair, divide in 2 and use leave in. I part jn 4 sections (two my ears, one on my crown and one on back of my head) and apply the cream, brush through, then gel and brush with knock off bounce curl brush. I shake a bit and add mousse and scrunch it in. I do that in sections in each section all over my head. I scrunch excess wetness out with a cotton t shirt and then blow dry on high until it's mostly dry then i switch to warm and hold the diffuser to my head.",

I recently bought my mom the [Shark CryoGlow](https://www.sharkninja.com/shark-cryoglow-red-blue-infrared-iqled-face-mask-under-eye-cooling---blue-frost/FW312.html?dwvar_FW312_color=A4C8E1) face mask as a gift and she loves it! I tried it out and was blown away by how relaxing and refreshing it felt. For context, I don’t have acne and I am 28, so I don’t have wrinkles, but I do have terribly dry eyes and under-eye “puffiness.” I did the Cooling Eye Revive treatment and it was heavenly.\n\nSo now I am considering treating myself to an LED mask as well. I bought the Shark for my mom because that is the one she wanted, but I’m not sure if there is a better mask for my needs (mostly cooling under the eyes and de-puffing). I guess it’s never too early to start anti-aging treatments, too! In terms of budget, I’m worth it 😉. I would love it if people would share their recommendations for their favorite cooling LED masks. Thank you!",

When I break out, as I am today, it’s usually in the form of these large red raised bumps, that hurts to touch. They can last for weeks and almost always leaves a dark spot. I’m 30+, darker skinned Asian and have PIH. I’d say my skin is skewed slightly towards the drier side, but not by much.\n\nMy goal is to even the texture, reduce the visual pores &amp; pits, prevent these types of breakouts (they hurt and are very visible), and reduce the dark spots &amp; redness.\n\nMy current routine involves CeraVe salicylic cleanser, then moisturizer every night. Sunscreen everyday. I also use a Peach Slices 10% azelaic acid serum  and CeraVe Retinol serum 1x/week. Anymore and it starts to burn.\nI’ve done this routine for multiple months now, and rarely break out of it.\n\nI appreciate any and all feedback!",

(Too much weighs it down) then I scrunch with a microfiber towel and air dry. \n\nWhen I sleep, I’ve tried so many methods that have all resulted in flattened curls, frizz, or random pieces sticking up. This means I have to re-wet and style my hair almost EVERY day, and I know it’s bad for it. I’ve tried a pineapple bun with a bonnet before realizing that only works on thick hair, I’ve tried just the bonnet, and I’ve even tried a loose low ponytail both with a bonnet and without. (Just silk pillowcase) \n\nI’d love to grow out my hair, but all the brushing from styling daily is giving me split ends.\n\nNo matter what I try, it’ll never be good enough just to wet it a little and head out.

      "content": "Hi! I’m looking for some routine advice for my curls because my texture has changed a lot recently and I’m not sure how to work with it anymore.\n\nMy hair used to be much fuller, but now it’s straighter at the top and curlier at the bottom. I also wear hijab, which means my hair is usually in a bun for most of the day and even when I’m at home I tend to keep it tied up. Because of that, my curls usually dry smushed or stretched out.\n\nMy current routine:\n\t•\twash + condition with OGX Coconut Curls\n\t•\tbrush, then use pomegranate/manuka honey hair oil\n\t•\tthen I put it in a bun right away (including sleeping with it up)\n\nBy the next morning it’s dry but frizzy/undefined, so I brush it out and add more oil — which makes it easier to manage but the curls don’t look great.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of product recommendations, but I’m not sure what works best when you wear hijab and need your hair to be wrapped most of the day. Some products also feel messy or leave residue, which shows on scarves, so I’m hesitant.\n\nDoes anyone have tips for:\n\t•\tcurl-friendly routines for people who keep their hair wrapped often\n\t•\tways to avoid losing curl definition from constant buns\n\t•\thijab-friendly lightweight products that won’t stain\n\t•\tstyles that protect curls without completely flattening them",

The second photo is 10 hours later. I didn’t use hair spray or anything, even worked all evening and they mostly held. I noticed more defined waves in my hair that was put up, just from the steam. \n\nMy hair has never been able to hold a curl when I try to style it, I am so confused 😂 \n\nI bought Not Your Mother’s curl foam and cream to try out. I’m so out of my league here if somebody can help. I have a fine, silky hair type if that helps. What type of curls could these be!?",

Other than Un-Doo-Goo shampoo with a ph of 9, the most common alkaline solutions are hydrogen peroxide in order to get permanent dye into hair and hydroxides of various sorts to chemically treat.  \n\nSo other than Un-Doo-Goo, is there no other way to penetrate hair without resorting to harsh chemicals?   Altho I'm not sure if Un-Doo-Goo actually has a ph or 9, anyone ever do a ph meter test?",
