      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

      "content": "I’ve recently bought an LED light mask which comes with red light (anti-ageing), near infrared light (pore refinement), yellow light (brightening), and blue light (acne) settings. \n\nThe recommended treatment times are 3 x week, 10 mins for the red light, 2 x week, 20 mins for blue light, 3 x week, 20 mins for yellow light, and 3 x week, 10 mins for the near infrared light. \n\nI want to use all of these modes but spending over 2.5 hours each week with an LED mask on seems like a lot. Is there a maximum recommended amount generally? \n\nAm I approaching this correctly by doing them all together, or should I be alternating (6 weeks doing the recommended routine for red light, then switching to yellow etc), or something else entirely? Does anyone have any experience with at home LED masks? Or even better, specifically with the BeautyPro Photon LED mask. \n\nI feel like I should alternate days because each colour has different skincare recommendations (I’m thinking Vitamin C on the red and/or near infrared days, salicylic once a week on the blue days, and a hydrating moisturiser on the other days), but I’m open to suggestions on that too as it’s just some recommendations from the box. Niacinimide irritates my skin but I’ve never had another ingredient cause problems and I’ve tried plenty. \n\nI’m a mid thirties woman with quite uneven skin tone, some thread veins and burst blood vessels, a little bit of sun damage, and blackheads with occasional spots (maybe 2-3 per month). I’m concerned mainly with even skin tone and anti-ageing. Thanks for any advice you can offer! ",

Parts of my hair like the back top and the sides by my ears are more coarse and don't hold curls. They just become frizzy S curls.

I recently bought my mom the [Shark CryoGlow](https://www.sharkninja.com/shark-cryoglow-red-blue-infrared-iqled-face-mask-under-eye-cooling---blue-frost/FW312.html?dwvar_FW312_color=A4C8E1) face mask as a gift and she loves it! I tried it out and was blown away by how relaxing and refreshing it felt. For context, I don’t have acne and I am 28, so I don’t have wrinkles, but I do have terribly dry eyes and under-eye “puffiness.” I did the Cooling Eye Revive treatment and it was heavenly.\n\nSo now I am considering treating myself to an LED mask as well. I bought the Shark for my mom because that is the one she wanted, but I’m not sure if there is a better mask for my needs (mostly cooling under the eyes and de-puffing). I guess it’s never too early to start anti-aging treatments, too! In terms of budget, I’m worth it 😉. I would love it if people would share their recommendations for their favorite cooling LED masks. Thank you!",

      "content": "Hi! I’m looking for some routine advice for my curls because my texture has changed a lot recently and I’m not sure how to work with it anymore.\n\nMy hair used to be much fuller, but now it’s straighter at the top and curlier at the bottom. I also wear hijab, which means my hair is usually in a bun for most of the day and even when I’m at home I tend to keep it tied up. Because of that, my curls usually dry smushed or stretched out.\n\nMy current routine:\n\t•\twash + condition with OGX Coconut Curls\n\t•\tbrush, then use pomegranate/manuka honey hair oil\n\t•\tthen I put it in a bun right away (including sleeping with it up)\n\nBy the next morning it’s dry but frizzy/undefined, so I brush it out and add more oil — which makes it easier to manage but the curls don’t look great.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of product recommendations, but I’m not sure what works best when you wear hijab and need your hair to be wrapped most of the day. Some products also feel messy or leave residue, which shows on scarves, so I’m hesitant.\n\nDoes anyone have tips for:\n\t•\tcurl-friendly routines for people who keep their hair wrapped often\n\t•\tways to avoid losing curl definition from constant buns\n\t•\thijab-friendly lightweight products that won’t stain\n\t•\tstyles that protect curls without completely flattening them",

I got a perm a about a month ago (the second perm after about 3 months) and noticed a week or two ago that my hair has been shedding way more than usual. Im not sure if I remembered this happened with my first perm or I just did not notice. When I run my hands through my each tome hair, il catch like 3 or 4 hairs falling off constantly. Or when I shower, I noticed a lot more hair getting caught in my hand. I can't see any patches of balding but I do see the roots of the hairs that fall out. I noticed one hair with a split end. They are usually bent out of shape, probably from the perm, but I am scared I started balding because of the perm or some other underlying process. The hairdresser also noticed I had a very dry scalp and some dandruff. Should I be concerned or any advice? Is it normal to experience this?",

My hair is also thin but very dense, so my curls can get super separated throughout the day if it’s windy, put in a certain hairstyle, etc. My hair routine currently is to wash with hydrating shampoo and conditioner and style with leave-in, curl defining cream, and a little gel. (Too much weighs it down) then I scrunch with a microfiber towel and air dry. \n\nWhen I sleep, I’ve tried so many methods that have all resulted in flattened curls, frizz, or random pieces sticking up. This means I have to re-wet and style my hair almost EVERY day, and I know it’s bad for it. I’ve tried a pineapple bun with a bonnet before realizing that only works on thick hair, I’ve tried just the bonnet, and I’ve even tried a loose low ponytail both with a bonnet and without. (Just silk pillowcase) \n\nI’d love to grow out my hair, but all the brushing from styling daily is giving me split ends.\n\nNo matter what I try, it’ll never be good enough just to wet it a little and head out. I’m tired of my morning routine being so long! What do I do?\n\n",
