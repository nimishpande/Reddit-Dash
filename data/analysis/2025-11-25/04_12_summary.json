      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

My hair was pre lightened on the ends with a tinge of green when I went in; so she wanted something with a red undertone to cancel the green. I asked to go a lighter dark brown to match my roots with some dimension in the ends and it is neither of those things. 😂 she told me to use a clarifying shampoo if I want to lighten it up but obv it’s gonna take more than that; so does anyone have suggestions?\n\nI have lightened my hair and colored it for yearssss but decided to treat myself and go to a salon this year. I’m willing to do some work myself if anyone has recommendations, but also willing to go pay a shit ton of money to a seasoned stylist if that’s what it will take 🤷🏻‍♀️ I don’t *hate* this color but after being so dimensional for years it’s hard to go all over dark all at once. And this is just so far from what I asked for lmao. \n\nThanks!! ",

I don’t really sweat that much and I don’t go to the gym super often, I actually haven’t gone to the gym in a few months and this has gotten worse since.\n\nI make sure not to reuse my shirts and wash them in between wears and shower daily. I’ve used salicylic acid on my back every time I go to shower and I used to use pen axle as well. The pen ox probably helped a little bit more, but I’m still not sure what to do about the acne scars and also how to get myself to stop picking at them.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for a routine?

I use the same routine except i use a mousse now. My hair doesn't hold curls like it used to. Only the ends are super curly. Am i lacking moisture? Do i need to add a hair mask? Parts of my hair like the back top and the sides by my ears are more coarse and don't hold curls. They just become frizzy S curls. If i do my hair i always get thick sections that never soak up water or dry well no matter if i brush style or finger curl. I don't like volume because i have so much hair and it gets hot. Please help me if you can. \n\nI have high porosity hair. Also don't mention any unevenness lol i cut my own hair.\n\nROUTINE: \nShampoo and conditioner: Marc anthony 3x moisture \nLeave in: As I am Leave in \nCream: Miss Jessie's Multicultural curl cream\nGel: Camille Rose Curl Maker \nMouse: Doux Def Texture Mousse \n\ni wet my hair, divide in 2 and use leave in. I part jn 4 sections (two my ears, one on my crown and one on back of my head) and apply the cream, brush through, then gel and brush with knock off bounce curl brush. I shake a bit and add mousse and scrunch it in. I do that in sections in each section all over my head. I scrunch excess wetness out with a cotton t shirt and then blow dry on high until it's mostly dry then i switch to warm and hold the diffuser to my head.",

My hair is also thin but very dense, so my curls can get super separated throughout the day if it’s windy, put in a certain hairstyle, etc. My hair routine currently is to wash with hydrating shampoo and conditioner and style with leave-in, curl defining cream, and a little gel. (Too much weighs it down) then I scrunch with a microfiber towel and air dry. \n\nWhen I sleep, I’ve tried so many methods that have all resulted in flattened curls, frizz, or random pieces sticking up. This means I have to re-wet and style my hair almost EVERY day, and I know it’s bad for it. I’ve tried a pineapple bun with a bonnet before realizing that only works on thick hair, I’ve tried just the bonnet, and I’ve even tried a loose low ponytail both with a bonnet and without. (Just silk pillowcase) \n\nI’d love to grow out my hair, but all the brushing from styling daily is giving me split ends.\n\nNo matter what I try, it’ll never be good enough just to wet it a little and head out. I’m tired of my morning routine being so long! What do I do?\n\n",

      "content": "Hi! I’m looking for some routine advice for my curls because my texture has changed a lot recently and I’m not sure how to work with it anymore.\n\nMy hair used to be much fuller, but now it’s straighter at the top and curlier at the bottom. I also wear hijab, which means my hair is usually in a bun for most of the day and even when I’m at home I tend to keep it tied up. Because of that, my curls usually dry smushed or stretched out.\n\nMy current routine:\n\t•\twash + condition with OGX Coconut Curls\n\t•\tbrush, then use pomegranate/manuka honey hair oil\n\t•\tthen I put it in a bun right away (including sleeping with it up)\n\nBy the next morning it’s dry but frizzy/undefined, so I brush it out and add more oil — which makes it easier to manage but the curls don’t look great.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of product recommendations, but I’m not sure what works best when you wear hijab and need your hair to be wrapped most of the day. Some products also feel messy or leave residue, which shows on scarves, so I’m hesitant.\n\nDoes anyone have tips for:\n\t•\tcurl-friendly routines for people who keep their hair wrapped often\n\t•\tways to avoid losing curl definition from constant buns\n\t•\thijab-friendly lightweight products that won’t stain\n\t•\tstyles that protect curls without completely flattening them",
