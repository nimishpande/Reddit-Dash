      "content": "The first clip is from 2024, and I considered that a good hair day. The second clip (black shirt) is from today’s hair wash. I went to a curly hair stylist that helped me blend my layers together more. I’m due for a hair cut soon to add shape back into my hair. When I started my hair journey back 2021, I tried everything, from brush styling to the bowl method and spending a lot of money on too many hair products. Then one day I just started a simple routine with 1-2 styling product (that’s how I learned what my hair likes.). I noticed since my hair is fine, I need texture styling products. I had to learn to love my hair, since my hair has so many patterns. I used to be so envious of people with perfect curls/waves. My straight bottom hair used to be my biggest insecurity about my hair. Once I started noticing more people that had hair like mine, it helped me accept my hair. And taking pictures along the way while trying to figure it out, helped majorly and keeping track of which products work and didn’t work. If you have been on your curly/wavy hair journey or just started, don’t stop. I know it can be frustrating, but keep going, it’s worth it. \n\nRoutine: \n\n1. Shampoo - Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat (wash x2 since I wash every 2-3 days) \n\n2. Conditioner - Giovanni 50:50 Balance \n\n3. Wet plop for about 10 minutes \n\n4. Take my hair out of towel and shake my head side to side, then take my fingers and shake my hair roots that are stuck to my scalp. \n\n5. Scrunch Not Your Mother’s Beach Babe Foam, one side at a time. Making sure I get the back of my head ask well. then wait 10-15 minutes. Then defuse with hair dryer. ",

All tips are appreciated!\n\nMy routine:\n\n1. Washed my hair with curl shampoo, used a hair mask and then used curl conditioner. Washed it all out obviously.\n\n2. I applied the curl cream to soaking wet hair, spread it by brushing my hair. Then I scrunched a little and then scrunched the curl defining gel in and scrunched all the way to my head (I reapplied some water with a spray bottle because the tiktok tutorials said to keep the hair as wet as possible) (I used Bali curl products but I had this problem with other products before too so I don’t think the product is the issue haha)\n\n3.

      "content": "Hi all, new here and will take all the advice I can get!\n\nBackstory: I have a giant exam on Friday I’m supposed to be studying for, so like any rational person I got side tracked on the internet for HOURS.\n\nI was steaming a shirt in my bathroom to de-wrinkle it, when I noticed the teeny little curl (pic 3, the one that started it all). My hair does that a lot with humidity, but I never thought beyond that. I’ve said for years I have stick straight hair, but alas, here we are 😂 I’ve always wanted \\*not\\* straight, flat hair, so I clung to that hope/urge to procrastinate. \n\nI immediately found this subreddit and started scrolling. Then googling. Then putting strands of hair in a glass of water. \n\nTurns out I have low porosity hair, which makes a lot of sense. I never moisturize my hair (as clearly evidenced in photo 2, pre-experiment) because it gets oily so quickly, but the internet tells me that’s because it’s not absorbing the heavy products I’d try on it every other month or so. I’d get annoyed that it made my hair oily, and go back to no moisture, only to try again with a super heavy product when I decided to combat the follicular dehydration again. And the cycle continued. \n\nI decided to put off my responsibilities further and go to Walmart to find a low porosity friendly leave in conditioner. I don’t know if this one for sure qualifies, but it was grad-school budget friendly, so I rolled with it. I always brush my hair essentially flat to my scalp right after I shower, but this time I used the leave in conditioner and scrunched my hair rather than brushing it out immediately. I used a microfiber towel I usually use when washing my face to scrunch more. It looked wavy (and probably is just wavy) and I figured it was just texture from the scrunching. \n\nI waited it out though! I’m usually a constant play-with-my-hair-er, so it was brutal trying not to touch it while it dried, but when I checked it out after studying a bit, I found a full on curl?! (Is that a curl? A wave? I honestly have no idea what it classifies as, I have no idea what I’m doing. The rest is just wavy for sure, but the first photo is of my golden child chunk of hair 😂)\n\nWhatever it is, it feels like it’s not from scrunching, and I now have so much enthusiasm and so little knowledge on how to keep making progress here. \n\nSorry for the long winded post, I’m just genuinely so jazzed that my hair is doing anything, and I figured maybe someone here would have advice!\n\nRoutine: native strengthening shampoo + conditioner, not your mother’s leave in conditioner ",

I just want to throw this out there: Redensyl, Capixyl, Procapil, rosemary oil, and caffeine are all marketed as having both empirical and anecdotal data suggesting they’re effective for treating hair/thinning loss, but I promise you most of that data is questionable at best. Lots of it is commissioned at the behest of those making these products or ingredients, so be weary.\n\nOn a personal note, I’ve tried just about every scalp serum with a solid ingredient list on the market for 6 months at least.\n\nNécessaire’s “The Scalp Serum” with 5% Capixyl is the **ONLY** one available on the market that makes a *noticeable* difference(even at that, it’s just enough to notice and nothing more). And it’s $48 for 1 fl oz. Not worth it. However, it’s the only thing I’ve found with a peptide concentration high enough to actually deliver it where it needs to go for uptake.\n\nEverything else you can get in stores just isn’t worth it. If you’ve got the budget and want to throw a little extra jazz in your haircare routine, go for it. It works nicely with topical minoxidil to help thicken hair and reduce shedding.",

I have fortunately never had any serious acne in terms of like serious breakouts and for the most part, my skin is pretty ok. I get some blackheads here and there, some minor congestion in certain areas etc. but what bothers me are these random spots that seemingly always come out of nowhere.\n\nFor example right now I have one in the middle of my forehead, one on my hairline and one on the cheek. Why?! The timing is random (not cycle related), the area is random, sometimes I get none, sometimes 3 at once, sometimes one. The pimples are always inflamed and take quite a long time to go away even with spot treatments and pimple patches. I really do not understand it.\n\nI use a gentle cleanser, hydrating toner, cream, spf etc., I exfoliate gently, do clay masks weekly, my skin is not dry or oily, I would say the current routine is working very well in general, I don't think it is a product problem because as I said, sometimes my skin is clear and I use the same stuff every day. I also use azelaic acid daily and it helps my skin a lot but doesn't prevent these random blemishes. I have used adapalene in the past and not willing to go through that again lol.\n\nIt's just so annoying to have a fairly nice skin and then bam, big angry pimple right in the middle of my forehead. Is this normal? Do I just have unrealistic expectations? Is the only solution spot treatment? I feel like this is just not serious enough to use any harsh actives and risk compromising my barrier but at the same time so annoying. Any ideas?\n\n  \n",

      "title": "How do I get my hair to look/stay like this VS this (what am I doing wrong?)",
      "content": "Heyo, sorry for the long post, basically I want my hair to look like it does in the first 2 images (particularly the first) consistently/stay like that thru a day VS frizzy/undefined in 3/4 OR whatever tf it is in image 5, which seems to be most frequent. \n\nFor context: 21, Central FL (hot+humidaf), healthy scalp, high porosity (i think?), 3a-3c(?), not thin but def not dense/thick, and very very fine hair (super fine strands). Cold water=130ppm Hot=200+ ppm\n\nHair was rlly thin two years ago (thank god it’s not that bad anymore) and only started caring about my hair like that the last year. \n\nIm not too sure what my issues really come down to, but I think my hierarchy of needs for products is:      1. **Lightweight** 2. **Deep/lasting moisture** 3. **Anti-frizz** 4. **Growth/repair** 5. **Heat protection**\n\n# Products \n\n**\\*SHAMPOO\\***\n\n\\-I use either ***L’Oréal Elvive curls*** OR ***As I Am Castor*** for shampoo, and quite happy with both but leaning towards as I am I think. I typically coat my entire hair/head, leave on for 15 seconds, and rinse out. Double cleanse, lukewarm water. ** **\n\n**\\*COWASH\\***\n\n\\-I use the ***As I Am Castor*** cowash, and I’m pretty satisfied with it, but seeing as in a 7-9 day period I sometimes cowash twice before shampooing again, I’m considering adding in a different one to use alongside, or trying new ones out in general, or even looking at hair masks, which btw, please explain the difference between them and a cowash, and what are overnight hair masks? \n\n**\\*RINSE OUT CONDITIONER\\***\n\n\\-I used to use ***Shea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine*** and liked it, but decided to experiment and have tried a few different things. For right now (I know this is bad), I just use ***Kinky Curly Knot Today*** for my rinse out. Try my best to rake/apply to ends only, leave in for \\~3 mins, rinse out. Was considering trying ***Creme of Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment***\n\n**\\*LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER\\***\n\n**-**I’ve been using either ***Pillow Soft Curls*** or ***Kinky Curly Knot Today*** for leave in conditioner, and apply when hair is wet, not damp or dry (not soaking wet either though, should I?). I think I like KC more than PSC, and previously used base skala but felt it dried out really really quick. KC gives me some nice clumps and doesn’t ever feel crunchy if pure air drying, and still leaves some bounce and is very lightweight. Pillow soft has been pretty decent too I think, only been using for the last week-ish though. Considering trying ***curlsmith*** \n\n**\\*MOUSSE\\***\n\n**-**I only recently started using mousse and realized I’d been applying it incorrectly/using bad ones. I’m very new to mousse still, though, and absolutely taking recommendations AND specifically recommendations on how to apply. I used to use ***Shea Moisture Frizz Free Curl Mousse*** but switched to ***The Doux Def Texture Foam*** and like it quite a bit better. I typically apply it to my hands, lightly rub together, and then gloss my hair, and then rake, and then lightly scrunch (directly after applying leave in conditioner); considering using ***curlsmith***\n\n**\\*LEAVE-IN OIL/PROTECTANT/SERUM (?)\\***\n\n\\-I don’t usually use any, but I want to start, but don’t know what to use exactly, and right now I use ***Camille Rose Rosemary Oil Strengthening Leave In Conditioner***; I know it says conditioner but it really is more like an oil solution. I suck at applying it I feel, sometimes use too much, and can’t figure out at what stage of the process I should use it. \n\n**\\*PRE-POO + OVERNIGHT OIL TREATMENT\\***\n\n**-**i definitely notice and love it when I do pre shampoo, but I’m not sure what oils/products to use, and don’t do it every time. I currently use ***African Pride “Feel-It” Formula*** for pre poo (10-30 mins). Also any info on overnight treatments, what products/oils, do it or don’t, if so then before shampoo days only, or also cowash days?\n\n**\\*POMADE / BALM\\***\n\n**-**I also don’t really use this, but occasionally I will for spots that aren’t cooperating, or if I have to just get up and leave, or to even refresh certain spots. I use ***The Doux Bonita Afro Balm*** and just apply to strands/ends, and then scrunch/style and go.\n\n**\\*OTHERS/MISC\\***\n\n**-**I haven’t tried: hair spray, dry shampoo, hair mask, custard, gel, lotion, definers, protein and or acidic treatments/products, hair tonic, hair milks, thermal protectants, curl refreshers, pre shampoo specific products, detangling specific products, rice water or protein stuff, actual serums, or curl creams.\n\n# Styling/Routine\n\n**\\*STYLING\\***\n\nHonestly, I think I suck at styling, and I really need a video to see how I should be styling my hair and applying products, particularly after getting out the shower. I sometimes use a diffuser especially if I’m leaving soon, but it leaves my hair either too dry (3/4 pic) or like pic 5. I typically gloss then rake products in, scrunch after applying mousse, and air dry, and then pick/fluff with my hands (rlly bad habit I know)\n\n\\***ROUTINE\\***\n\n**D1**: pre poo w/ oil, shampoo double cleanse, RO cond., LE cond., mousse, air dry/diffuse halfway, (sometimes) rosemary oil thingie, air dry rest of way\n\n**D2**: Same as D1 without prepoo/shampoo\n\n**D3:** (depending on how it looks) sometimes the exact same as day 2, other times will opt out of mousse and/or Camille rosemary oil thingie. \n\n**D4:** no oil, rarely mousse, sometimes won’t use LE cond or just use less of it. Sometimes will skip straight to D5 process (cowash day) \n\n**D5**: cowash, and then the exact same as D2\n\n**D6**: rinse out conditioner, leave in conditioner (usually less), sometimes mousse \n\n**D7+:** usually just go with the flow, as in observe my hair and feel it, and then either decide to restart the cycle n shampoo, or cowash, or continue just using rinse out+leave in or sometimes just rinse out. Just depends but tbh, ***I don’t know what I’m doing at all, I need recs/feedback and guidance/tips**** *\n\n*\\*—sometimes go 8-9 days between shampoo but cowash again at some point*\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBasically I just want my hair to always look like the first 2 pics and get it to actually last like that throughout the day, and my hair usually looks like the last image most of the time. I don’t know if I have damage, frizz issues, breakage, too thin of hair, if I’m forcing curls, using the wrong products, or simply styling/applying products wrong. I’m also looking for to repair hair + \n\nIm looking for any and all product recs (whether I use the type of product or not), most definitely looking for styling/application methods and recs, and also an explanation of wtf is going on with my hair? Generally any thoughts, comments, opinions, recs, tips tricks etc. all welcomed, thank you!\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nHow can I get my hair to be like the first pic consistently and make it last; what am I doing wrong/what is happening, what types of products do I need, what specific recommendations, any styling/application + routine tips?

So i started following a routine after a brief research and a consultation from a dermat. \n\nIt's been almost two weeks since I started and I see visible pores and tiny pimples along with whiteheads forming especially around the skin beside my nose as you can see. I hate whiteheads especially because they cause scars on my face after they heal.\n\nThis is my routine and the products that I use. \n\n1)Glowriance skin renewing face wash \n\n2) minimalist 10%  niacinamide  serum\n\n3)Neutrogena Hydroboost gel based moisturizer \n\n4)Re-equip ultra matte dry sunscreen(blue bottle)\n\nI have an appointment with my dermat this weekend.

I’m hoping the picture helps in someway and someone with similar hair can help me out. I am thinking of growing my hair out got bored of always keeping it short and having a fade but since it falls flat the moment i wash it I don’t know if it’ll even look good when they’re longer. \n\nI use scalpe plus 1-2 times a week and dove shampoo 1-2 times a week (i almost shampoo every time because it becomes greasy) if I don’t condition it becomes even frizzier. I’ve tried the dove mask as well but it doesnt do much. I stopped oiling years ago.",

It protects the lips very well &amp; keeps them moisturized for good period of time. I didn't get any bitter aftertaste in my case. No, it does not help with natural pigmentation of lips. A budget friendly Spf 40 lip balm. WRP without a doubt. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nKetocip shampoo: It has 2% Ketoconazole and works really really well not only for dandruff but also for the Fungal acne (the main reason i got this product) but since Ketoconazole makes the hair dry make sure to use decent amount of conditioner. WRP but when i'd need it. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nPlum 5% Niacinamide serum: Worked well for controlling oil and reducing the dark spots to some extent. I had been using it since it was launched &amp; it was my 3rd bottle but lately noticed that it didn't work like before. It could be the quality issue (have noticed that many Indian brands degrade the quality once the product gets popular) or my skin got used to it. WNRP. ⭐⭐⭐ \n\nIn search of good quality niacinamide serum preferably from a pharma brand. Please drop the recommendations if you have any. ",

And broke me out occasionally But since I was so clueless I used it up to about 4-5 months because I thought the squeaky clean feeling was a good sign (IT WASNT!). For now I don't want expensive products and extended skincare like serums, toners and all. Just need an effective cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen, that's it! This is the skincare routine I'm aiming to buy around this month or next month. I'm probably not gonna change my decision to buy these since it took me a lot of digging and understanding my personal skin's feelings but i would like to hear a more variety and wider perspective of recommendations and your thoughts too. I know some of these are cheap but my skin is young and i Just want to maintain it and control my break outs even though I know hormonal acne and break outs won't be fully curable in my current age. :)\n\nFyi : i have combo to oily acne prone skin, climate is extremely hot dry and occasionally humid (Raj. Jodhpur weather)",

      "title": "[Acne] I FINALLY got rid of my closed comodomes!",
      "content": "Hello All! It has been A JOURNEY (to say the least lol) to finally figure out what worked best for my skin and get rid of my closed comdomes!\n\nWhen I was struggling with this issue, I came straight to reddit and there weren't many answers on success stories and now that I have reached a place that I call a success, I wanted to share it!\n\nMy skin started to change DRAMATICALLY about a year and a half after I went off birth control, specifically on my chin, temples, and sometimes my cheeks. I spent months researching better methods and routines (with the least amount of ingredients and steps) to get my skin to a place that I can go out without makeup confidently! I utilized the EWG website and the Sezia website to heavily research the products and ingredients I was putting on my face (to avoid fungal acne mostly and chemicals haha).\n\nI made an appointment with a derm to confirm if my acne was fungal or closed comodomes and she stated it was closed comodomes (which was a good way to start and not get sucked down the fungal route). My derm did prescribe me a sulfur cleanser, which I agreed to since I saw a lot of success from adding sulfur to your routine (it has a ton of benefits). She also tried to put me on tretinoin, but I absolutely refused because I don't personally like the idea of relying on too many things getting prescribed to me if I could just figure it out myself (my skin wasn't the worst in the world, just not super pretty to me). \n\nI was using Salicylic acid for a very long time, but it was doing absolutely NOTHING for my closed comodomes, which was infuriating. So, I did a deep dive on different exfoliants. I was put onto AHAs instead of BHAs, which was very new for me! I decided to try out glycolic acid (from the Ordinary). I have seen horror stories but also a lot of reccomedations for it (but when do you not see horror stories with exfoliants lol). I have sensitive skin so I took extra precautions in making sure I gently exposed my skin to new things and a new routine (and because I didn't do that before and learned my lesson...). \n\nI started by using it every 2 days, then after about a week or two I did every other day, and then a week later, I used it every night (which is my current routine).\n\nThat wasn't the only thing I changed. I also found that the cerve sunscreen and nighttime lotion were NOT working with my skin. My skin was so greasy and felt nasty, I didn't realize it was from my moisurizers!!! Additionally, my skin was so dry... I wish I had identified that sooner, but we live and learn ya know.\n\nThe biggest advice I will give is give it time (literally the worst, I know). It took about 4 months of consistent routine to get my skin to a place where I am happy! Glycolic acid takes a while since it slowly absorbs into your skin and pushes the acne out, so you have to be patient. I almost gave up in November because my skin was at it's worst, but I persisted and I'm SO GLAD I didn't change my routine.\n\nAnother piece of advice is to not pick at your skin. I am sure you hear that alot, but it truly does help with the healing process! (And prevent scarring)\n\nSo without further ado, here is my routine:\n\nAM\n1. wash my face with warm water\n2. Purito oat in calming gel cream moisturizer\n3. Cetaphil SPF 5O sheer mineral liquid suncreen\n\nPM\n1. Micellar water (the one with the pink lid because it has the least ingredients) - only if I have makeup on!\n2. Derm prescribed sodium sulfacetamide 10% Sulfur 5% face cleanser \n3. Ordinary brand glycolic acid (THE HOLY GRAIL)\n4. Purito oat in calming gel cream\n5. Ordinary brand hyaluronic acid (when my face is feeling extra dry)\n\nAnd that is it! Honestly, this is the easiest routine I have ever had and I LOVE it. My skin feels happy, moisturized, and no more closed comodomes! Now that doesn't mean I don't get hormonal acne, but with my routine it goes away very quickly! \n\nI could probably use a different sulfur soap that isn't prescribed, but this is what I was using consistently, so I am just keeping up with that routine.\n\nI added some photos in here (they are in chronological order from late October to early February)! I tried to document the process as much as possible because that's what I wanted to see on reddit haha. I didn't start taking photos until I used the glycolic acid on a nightly basis. I hope this helps! The only thing I have really been \"struggling\" with is redness after the acne is gone, which just takes time (patience again).\n\nIf you read my essay, THANK YOU for taking to time to read my story, and I hope this helps more people not waste too much time and money on skincare haha.\n\n\n\n\n",
