      "content": "The first clip is from 2024, and I considered that a good hair day. The second clip (black shirt) is from today’s hair wash. I went to a curly hair stylist that helped me blend my layers together more. I’m due for a hair cut soon to add shape back into my hair. When I started my hair journey back 2021, I tried everything, from brush styling to the bowl method and spending a lot of money on too many hair products. Then one day I just started a simple routine with 1-2 styling product (that’s how I learned what my hair likes.). I noticed since my hair is fine, I need texture styling products. I had to learn to love my hair, since my hair has so many patterns. I used to be so envious of people with perfect curls/waves. My straight bottom hair used to be my biggest insecurity about my hair. Once I started noticing more people that had hair like mine, it helped me accept my hair. And taking pictures along the way while trying to figure it out, helped majorly and keeping track of which products work and didn’t work. If you have been on your curly/wavy hair journey or just started, don’t stop. I know it can be frustrating, but keep going, it’s worth it. \n\nRoutine: \n\n1. Shampoo - Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat (wash x2 since I wash every 2-3 days) \n\n2. Conditioner - Giovanni 50:50 Balance \n\n3. Wet plop for about 10 minutes \n\n4. Take my hair out of towel and shake my head side to side, then take my fingers and shake my hair roots that are stuck to my scalp. \n\n5. Scrunch Not Your Mother’s Beach Babe Foam, one side at a time. Making sure I get the back of my head ask well. then wait 10-15 minutes. Then defuse with hair dryer. ",

It was painfully slow at first, but things have definitely gotten better! Here are the dates of the pictures for reference:\n\npic 1: 8/5\n\npic 2: 9/19\n\npic 3: 10/30\n\npic 4: 12/1\n\npic 5: 12/22\n\npic 6: 1/22\n\npic 7: today! \n\nI’m really happy with my progress so far, but I’m anxious about whether it’s dense/healthy enough to grow out into a proper hairstyle. Do you guys think it’ll grow out nicely? Do you think I’ve hit a ceiling or could more regrowth be possible? I’ve gained a lot of hair back, but it’s still noticeably thinner than before my hair loss. \n\nThanks again to this community for all the info that got me this far!",

I have a combination of wavy and curly hair I think but I straightened it ever since I could think of because I just didn’t know how to deal with it right, but I really wanna learn! All tips are appreciated!\n\nMy routine:\n\n1. Washed my hair with curl shampoo, used a hair mask and then used curl conditioner. Washed it all out obviously.\n\n2. I applied the curl cream to soaking wet hair, spread it by brushing my hair. Then I scrunched a little and then scrunched the curl defining gel in and scrunched all the way to my head (I reapplied some water with a spray bottle because the tiktok tutorials said to keep the hair as wet as possible) (I used Bali curl products but I had this problem with other products before too so I don’t think the product is the issue haha)\n\n3. Then I diffused my hair, roots first, then the rest of the hair.\n\nThe picture is my hair after scrunching, the back was where it was still the dampest.",

It kinks and waves back up\n\n•\tIf my hair gets wet, it gets very frizzy unless styled properly\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\n•\tI usually air-dry/towel-dry\n\n•\tI don’t use heat often\n\n•\tI only shampoo my hair using Herbal Essence Honey shampoo. I don’t put any creams/gels etc in my hair. I don’t currently use a conditioner.\n\n•\tI’m open to shampoo, conditioner, leave-ins, curl creams, gels, etc.\n\nI’m currently considering brands like Amika, but I’m totally open to other suggestions.

Looking at photos of myself two years ago, my pores and sebaceous filaments are not nearly as big or noticeable as they are now, and my skin was a lot more even of a texture. I feel like no matter what I do, they only get worse. \n\nI have pretty dry, mildly acne-prone, and flaky skin that gets irritated extremely easily. I react really poorly to most skincare- I get dry flaky patches, redness, itchiness, tightness, painful burns, or I break out. \n\nMy pores are so huge, and prominent in places they weren't before. What can I do? I've been slowly troubleshooting and adding new things to try and help, but I'm at my wits end. \n\n  \n**Current routine:** \n\n  \nPM: Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil (start on dry skin, then emulsify with water). I only started double cleansing about a month ago, it's the newest thing I've added. \n\n Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser\n\n Byoma Milky Toner (on damp skin). Wait for toner to dry 15-20 minutes\n\nEvery other day, Tretinoin .025% Wait for tretinoin to dry 15-20 minutes \n\nVanicream Moisturizing Cream \n\nEgyptian Magic around eyes and lips\n\nOn days I don't use tret, I slug with Vaseline.\n\n\n\nAM: Rinse with water \n\nByoma Milky Toner (on damp skin)\n\nSkinAqua Super Moisture Milk UV 50+ or Anua Zero-Cast Moisturizing Finish Sunscreen\n\n  \nI've tried the Ordinary's niacinamide, but it was too much on my skin with the tret.\n\n  \nAny and all advice welcome!",

Went to the doctor, had labs done, everything came back normal and they said it was either post Covid hair loss or as my dermatologist said “sometimes hair just falls out” 😐\n\nThroughout the past few years, I’ve tried everything, tons of different vitamins and supplements, shampoo and conditioners, scalp serums, and I even did over five rounds of PRP scalp injections, which is both painful and expensive. Some things worked a little bit for a short period of time, but then the hair shedding would always come right back. I had all but given up, until I saw this product on Amazon called Mary Ruth’s liquid morning multivitamin + hair growth. It’s pretty expensive, but I said F it what do I have to lose? I’ve been using it every day for about three months now, and I can honestly say within the first month my hair was shedding way less. Now I only get normal shedding when I’m brushing my hair right after I shower. No more constantly, pulling out loose hairs throughout the day or my entire brush being covered in hair just from brushing it once. I usually keep my hair in a short bob since that was helping it fall out less, I haven’t gotten a haircut in almost 4 months and this is the longest I’ve been able to grow my hair in years without it all falling out!\n\nAnd no, I am not affiliated with this brand in any way this is a completely 100% honest review. If you’re struggling to find something that works for you I highly recommend trying it! It is absolutely worth the money (plus it actually tastes really good too). \n\nAs a sidenote, I’ve also been using Nioxins shampoo and conditioner for thinning hair, so that might have also helped!",
