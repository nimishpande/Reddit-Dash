      "content": "The first clip is from 2024, and I considered that a good hair day. The second clip (black shirt) is from today’s hair wash. I went to a curly hair stylist that helped me blend my layers together more. I’m due for a hair cut soon to add shape back into my hair. When I started my hair journey back 2021, I tried everything, from brush styling to the bowl method and spending a lot of money on too many hair products. Then one day I just started a simple routine with 1-2 styling product (that’s how I learned what my hair likes.). I noticed since my hair is fine, I need texture styling products. I had to learn to love my hair, since my hair has so many patterns. I used to be so envious of people with perfect curls/waves. My straight bottom hair used to be my biggest insecurity about my hair. Once I started noticing more people that had hair like mine, it helped me accept my hair. And taking pictures along the way while trying to figure it out, helped majorly and keeping track of which products work and didn’t work. If you have been on your curly/wavy hair journey or just started, don’t stop. I know it can be frustrating, but keep going, it’s worth it. \n\nRoutine: \n\n1. Shampoo - Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat (wash x2 since I wash every 2-3 days) \n\n2. Conditioner - Giovanni 50:50 Balance \n\n3. Wet plop for about 10 minutes \n\n4. Take my hair out of towel and shake my head side to side, then take my fingers and shake my hair roots that are stuck to my scalp. \n\n5. Scrunch Not Your Mother’s Beach Babe Foam, one side at a time. Making sure I get the back of my head ask well. then wait 10-15 minutes. Then defuse with hair dryer. ",

Then I scrunched a little and then scrunched the curl defining gel in and scrunched all the way to my head (I reapplied some water with a spray bottle because the tiktok tutorials said to keep the hair as wet as possible) (I used Bali curl products but I had this problem with other products before too so I don’t think the product is the issue haha)\n\n3.

My hair does that a lot with humidity, but I never thought beyond that. I’ve said for years I have stick straight hair, but alas, here we are 😂 I’ve always wanted \\*not\\* straight, flat hair, so I clung to that hope/urge to procrastinate. \n\nI immediately found this subreddit and started scrolling. Then googling. Then putting strands of hair in a glass of water. \n\nTurns out I have low porosity hair, which makes a lot of sense. I never moisturize my hair (as clearly evidenced in photo 2, pre-experiment) because it gets oily so quickly, but the internet tells me that’s because it’s not absorbing the heavy products I’d try on it every other month or so. I’d get annoyed that it made my hair oily, and go back to no moisture, only to try again with a super heavy product when I decided to combat the follicular dehydration again. And the cycle continued. \n\nI decided to put off my responsibilities further and go to Walmart to find a low porosity friendly leave in conditioner. I don’t know if this one for sure qualifies, but it was grad-school budget friendly, so I rolled with it. I always brush my hair essentially flat to my scalp right after I shower, but this time I used the leave in conditioner and scrunched my hair rather than brushing it out immediately. I used a microfiber towel I usually use when washing my face to scrunch more. It looked wavy (and probably is just wavy) and I figured it was just texture from the scrunching. \n\nI waited it out though! I’m usually a constant play-with-my-hair-er, so it was brutal trying not to touch it while it dried, but when I checked it out after studying a bit, I found a full on curl?! (Is that a curl? A wave? I honestly have no idea what it classifies as, I have no idea what I’m doing. The rest is just wavy for sure, but the first photo is of my golden child chunk of hair 😂)\n\nWhatever it is, it feels like it’s not from scrunching, and I now have so much enthusiasm and so little knowledge on how to keep making progress here. \n\nSorry for the long winded post, I’m just genuinely so jazzed that my hair is doing anything, and I figured maybe someone here would have advice!\n\nRoutine: native strengthening shampoo + conditioner, not your mother’s leave in conditioner ",

I was actually close to booking with Smile but then I also saw Pure Line. Their consultation setup and the way they handle meetings felt like a big plus. Also the fact that they only do one operation per day is an important advantage. I asked both Smile and Vera for a video call with the doctor, but they said the doctors are very busy, so that wasn’t possible.\n\nClose friend of mine highly recommends Vera Clinic. His results look good but he only had mid scalp area so I’m not sure how their hairline design would be. To be honest, before checking Reddit, I was much closer to Vera or Smile. They're look very professional and thousands of Google reviews with a 4.9 rating felt reassuring. After reading Reddit, though my opinion changed a bit but I’m still not fully sure.\n\nIf anyone here has experience with one of these clinics, or can help me think this through, I’d really appreciate it",

I just want to throw this out there: Redensyl, Capixyl, Procapil, rosemary oil, and caffeine are all marketed as having both empirical and anecdotal data suggesting they’re effective for treating hair/thinning loss, but I promise you most of that data is questionable at best. Lots of it is commissioned at the behest of those making these products or ingredients, so be weary.\n\nOn a personal note, I’ve tried just about every scalp serum with a solid ingredient list on the market for 6 months at least.\n\nNécessaire’s “The Scalp Serum” with 5% Capixyl is the **ONLY** one available on the market that makes a *noticeable* difference(even at that, it’s just enough to notice and nothing more). And it’s $48 for 1 fl oz. Not worth it. However, it’s the only thing I’ve found with a peptide concentration high enough to actually deliver it where it needs to go for uptake.\n\nEverything else you can get in stores just isn’t worth it. If you’ve got the budget and want to throw a little extra jazz in your haircare routine, go for it. It works nicely with topical minoxidil to help thicken hair and reduce shedding.",

      "content": "This is a comparison between 2017 and today. The first pic is virgin hair and now I do my own cut/bleach at home which is why you can see sort of a poor regrowth line at my roots, lol. \n\nAt the time when I was 12-13 (a baby!!) my mom always bought me the giant jugs of treseme shampoo and conditioner because my hair is CHRONICALLY DRY. I don’t “scalp train” or whatever but my skin is dry from medication now too on top of the natural dryness so I shampoo once a week and I use about 3/4 cup of conditioner every wash (yikes.), loreal now with toning drops. \n\nWhat I noticed recently is my new growth is getting sort of bumpy/wavy like my moms hair is? I have always had pin straight hair even when I had pixie cuts except for the very ends would sort of “floof up” (I don’t have the energy to style my hair besides sea salt spray and the upside down and floof it method lol my mom was an 80s kid) \n\nIs it possible I *DO* have wavy hair and haven’t been using the correct products? Could using products for straight hair be contributing to the dryness? \n\nI’m also thinking about going back to arctic fox wrath again soon because life is depressing so I might make a separate post showing what that looked like to get some opinions. :) any tips for making at home cuts look a little more even in the back are welcome! I will not go to a salon again. People in my area (rural) seem to not get enough education to cut anything but a very simple layered or straight cut (and usually it ends up crooked) on dark brunette hair, and my hair is very fine and light (I do use ammonia free bleach so the damage isn’t crazy, the little bit you see is really just dryness and from running scissors along it for “alt” texture). Probably a generalization but I have been to 10 different stylists and had 2 good cuts and the good ones always leave for better places 😮‍💨\n\nProducts: (I add purple drops to everything) kristen ess clarifying shampoo 1x a week, loreal hyaluron plump glycolic+gloss conditioner, NYM sea salt spray, garnieer leave in conditioner. I don’t work out and I cannot leave the house often so my hair doesn’t get dirty (chronic illness) :) my scalp has no buildup of dandruff but I do get psoriasis flares maybe once a year thankfully it’s manageable.

      "title": "How do I get my hair to look/stay like this VS this (what am I doing wrong?)",
      "content": "Heyo, sorry for the long post, basically I want my hair to look like it does in the first 2 images (particularly the first) consistently/stay like that thru a day VS frizzy/undefined in 3/4 OR whatever tf it is in image 5, which seems to be most frequent. \n\nFor context: 21, Central FL (hot+humidaf), healthy scalp, high porosity (i think?), 3a-3c(?), not thin but def not dense/thick, and very very fine hair (super fine strands). Cold water=130ppm Hot=200+ ppm\n\nHair was rlly thin two years ago (thank god it’s not that bad anymore) and only started caring about my hair like that the last year. \n\nIm not too sure what my issues really come down to, but I think my hierarchy of needs for products is:      1. **Lightweight** 2. **Deep/lasting moisture** 3. **Anti-frizz** 4. **Growth/repair** 5. **Heat protection**\n\n# Products \n\n**\\*SHAMPOO\\***\n\n\\-I use either ***L’Oréal Elvive curls*** OR ***As I Am Castor*** for shampoo, and quite happy with both but leaning towards as I am I think. I typically coat my entire hair/head, leave on for 15 seconds, and rinse out. Double cleanse, lukewarm water. ** **\n\n**\\*COWASH\\***\n\n\\-I use the ***As I Am Castor*** cowash, and I’m pretty satisfied with it, but seeing as in a 7-9 day period I sometimes cowash twice before shampooing again, I’m considering adding in a different one to use alongside, or trying new ones out in general, or even looking at hair masks, which btw, please explain the difference between them and a cowash, and what are overnight hair masks? \n\n**\\*RINSE OUT CONDITIONER\\***\n\n\\-I used to use ***Shea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine*** and liked it, but decided to experiment and have tried a few different things. For right now (I know this is bad), I just use ***Kinky Curly Knot Today*** for my rinse out. Try my best to rake/apply to ends only, leave in for \\~3 mins, rinse out. Was considering trying ***Creme of Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment***\n\n**\\*LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER\\***\n\n**-**I’ve been using either ***Pillow Soft Curls*** or ***Kinky Curly Knot Today*** for leave in conditioner, and apply when hair is wet, not damp or dry (not soaking wet either though, should I?). I think I like KC more than PSC, and previously used base skala but felt it dried out really really quick. KC gives me some nice clumps and doesn’t ever feel crunchy if pure air drying, and still leaves some bounce and is very lightweight. Pillow soft has been pretty decent too I think, only been using for the last week-ish though. Considering trying ***curlsmith*** \n\n**\\*MOUSSE\\***\n\n**-**I only recently started using mousse and realized I’d been applying it incorrectly/using bad ones. I’m very new to mousse still, though, and absolutely taking recommendations AND specifically recommendations on how to apply. I used to use ***Shea Moisture Frizz Free Curl Mousse*** but switched to ***The Doux Def Texture Foam*** and like it quite a bit better. I typically apply it to my hands, lightly rub together, and then gloss my hair, and then rake, and then lightly scrunch (directly after applying leave in conditioner); considering using ***curlsmith***\n\n**\\*LEAVE-IN OIL/PROTECTANT/SERUM (?)\\***\n\n\\-I don’t usually use any, but I want to start, but don’t know what to use exactly, and right now I use ***Camille Rose Rosemary Oil Strengthening Leave In Conditioner***; I know it says conditioner but it really is more like an oil solution. I suck at applying it I feel, sometimes use too much, and can’t figure out at what stage of the process I should use it. \n\n**\\*PRE-POO + OVERNIGHT OIL TREATMENT\\***\n\n**-**i definitely notice and love it when I do pre shampoo, but I’m not sure what oils/products to use, and don’t do it every time. I currently use ***African Pride “Feel-It” Formula*** for pre poo (10-30 mins). Also any info on overnight treatments, what products/oils, do it or don’t, if so then before shampoo days only, or also cowash days?\n\n**\\*POMADE / BALM\\***\n\n**-**I also don’t really use this, but occasionally I will for spots that aren’t cooperating, or if I have to just get up and leave, or to even refresh certain spots. I use ***The Doux Bonita Afro Balm*** and just apply to strands/ends, and then scrunch/style and go.\n\n**\\*OTHERS/MISC\\***\n\n**-**I haven’t tried: hair spray, dry shampoo, hair mask, custard, gel, lotion, definers, protein and or acidic treatments/products, hair tonic, hair milks, thermal protectants, curl refreshers, pre shampoo specific products, detangling specific products, rice water or protein stuff, actual serums, or curl creams.\n\n# Styling/Routine\n\n**\\*STYLING\\***\n\nHonestly, I think I suck at styling, and I really need a video to see how I should be styling my hair and applying products, particularly after getting out the shower. I sometimes use a diffuser especially if I’m leaving soon, but it leaves my hair either too dry (3/4 pic) or like pic 5. I typically gloss then rake products in, scrunch after applying mousse, and air dry, and then pick/fluff with my hands (rlly bad habit I know)\n\n\\***ROUTINE\\***\n\n**D1**: pre poo w/ oil, shampoo double cleanse, RO cond., LE cond., mousse, air dry/diffuse halfway, (sometimes) rosemary oil thingie, air dry rest of way\n\n**D2**: Same as D1 without prepoo/shampoo\n\n**D3:** (depending on how it looks) sometimes the exact same as day 2, other times will opt out of mousse and/or Camille rosemary oil thingie. \n\n**D4:** no oil, rarely mousse, sometimes won’t use LE cond or just use less of it. Sometimes will skip straight to D5 process (cowash day) \n\n**D5**: cowash, and then the exact same as D2\n\n**D6**: rinse out conditioner, leave in conditioner (usually less), sometimes mousse \n\n**D7+:** usually just go with the flow, as in observe my hair and feel it, and then either decide to restart the cycle n shampoo, or cowash, or continue just using rinse out+leave in or sometimes just rinse out. Just depends but tbh, ***I don’t know what I’m doing at all, I need recs/feedback and guidance/tips**** *\n\n*\\*—sometimes go 8-9 days between shampoo but cowash again at some point*\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBasically I just want my hair to always look like the first 2 pics and get it to actually last like that throughout the day, and my hair usually looks like the last image most of the time. I don’t know if I have damage, frizz issues, breakage, too thin of hair, if I’m forcing curls, using the wrong products, or simply styling/applying products wrong. I’m also looking for to repair hair + \n\nIm looking for any and all product recs (whether I use the type of product or not), most definitely looking for styling/application methods and recs, and also an explanation of wtf is going on with my hair? Generally any thoughts, comments, opinions, recs, tips tricks etc. all welcomed, thank you!\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nHow can I get my hair to be like the first pic consistently and make it last; what am I doing wrong/what is happening, what types of products do I need, what specific recommendations, any styling/application + routine tips? Thank you for reading!",

      "content": "34 year old. Postpartum almost 2 years and have been dealing with skin issues since giving birth that’s made me change all the products and routines I was used to. Seeing dermatologist regularly\n\nConcerns: eczema and perioral dermatitis. On biweekly shots of dupixent and daily doxy. I think hylauronic acid might have been causing flairs so I’ve cut it from my routine. Also attempted using vanicream and would get red with cystic acne after use. Switched to fluoride free toothpaste and stopped using chemical sunscreens\n\nI get white heads and the occasional cystic acne in t zone and jaw line. Also have very dry skin and would like to reduce signs of aging\n\nThe current products I’m using have really helped clear my eczema/dermatitis, I just need guidance in order of use and if there’s anything I should drop or add\n\n1.\t⁠Laroche, Posay lipikar AP + gentle, foaming cleansing oil. (Use at night before other cleanser as a double cleanser)\n\n2.\t⁠Laroche Posay, toleriane purifying, foaming cleanser.\n\n3.\t⁠Paula choice 2% bha liquid exfoliant\n\n4.\t⁠Differin gel adapalene gel 0.1%\n\n5.\t⁠Azelaic acid gel 15%\n\n6.\t⁠Sulfacetamide sodium topical lotion 10%\n\n7.\t⁠Tretinoin cream 0.025% (I use this every other night and avoid around my mouth where my dermatitis flares the worse)\n\n8.\t⁠Cerave skin renewing nighttime face cream\n\n9.\t⁠La roche Posay toleriane double repair facial moisturizer\n\n10.\t⁠Epiceram ( I just started this and really struggle on the best place to put it in my routine, seems like it causes pilling. But it does so far feel like it’s healing my skin barrier)\n\n11.\t⁠Cerave tinted hydrating mineral sunscreen\n\nWould like to reincorporate corsx snail mucin, before all these issues flared my skin felt so hydrated after using. Just not sure best place to add or if I should avoid all together",
