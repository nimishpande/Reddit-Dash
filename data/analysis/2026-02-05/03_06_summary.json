      "content": "Ms Chetali Chadha is back to her old tricks again\n\nRoasting products because they have fragrance in one reel and in a different reel, sneaking in a paid promotion for a product that has not just fragrance, but also color. \n\nYou may have all seen that series the influence with chetali . It has been running for two months now.\n\nI always had a feeling that Chetali was carefully and smartly, putting in her paid promotions inside the reels while making it seem like a genuine informed information and today I got the proof\n\nProof number one in one of her recent videos, she has spoken about the best moisturizer for oily skin, and the Foxtale suncreen has been shown as a clear winner, however, if you have been following her series, you will know that she is dead against fragrance, and any other additives Foxtale moisturizer has both. \n\nIn her latest reel for dry skin moisturizer, she has failed Himalaya and Nivea because they use a particular ingredient that has been banned in the European Union because they use fragrance, however logic did not matter in case of Foxtale. \n\nLastly, if you see her reels, clearly she has done paid promotion for requil, formula RX and Be body wise without making disclosures by just making a point that she is giving them a higher ranking\n\nIt is very easy to figure out which product has paid in which product has not paid. If you just go and put a timer on the reel and see how many seconds she dedicates talking about a product that is paid versus what is not paid.\n\n Incase you don’t have context she has done it before in 2024 and 2025 always roasting products that have fragrance and then promoting the L’Oreal glycolic serum which also has fragrance but at that time it did not seem to make a difference to her because she was paid for it. Her values keep changing based on who’s paying her and who is not.\n\nI cannot believe she has come down to this. I was really liking her content, and it was seeming genuine and educated but now knowing what I know, it is terrible it really breaks my heart. ",

      "content": "Can shampoo actually do something with hair besides cleaning it? Can it nourish the hair, strengthen it or give it volume? I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

We are unsure on how to handle this. I suggested maybe some sort of undercut so that the crown area can hang down over maybe those hairs will curl nicer? If anyone has any input it would be greatly appreciated. Anything from tips to make my bad side curl and lay/grow better or haircut recommendations such as what I mentioned earlier.

Ive included several different styles ive had over the past 4 or so ears just to demonstrate how i look w different lengths, styles, parts, etc etc. currently my hair is the length of the first pic :/ but im willing to go much shorter or grow it out if it might work. In most of these pics ive had my partner cut my hair- he seems to do a decent job but is only an amateur at it so if the cut looks a bit rough thats why.\n\nOf course im considering going to a proper salon if i plan on a change. :)\n\nIm also considering doing something new with the colour- maybe highlights or something more drastic, though im completely at a loss here. I am worried about a very blonde colour washing me out or emphasising my red cheeks but otherwise, yeah, have very little idea :P\n\nI dont really have many preferences. I do actually sorta prefer the look and convenience of having it shorter (like pics 5, 8, 10, 15, 20) but am concerned that look doesnt work for me? Plus a few people have mentioned they think it looks best a bit longer :/ Pic 20 was from when i was a bit younger but its the shortest its been\n\nUltimately though im just looking for suggestions so anything (suggestions for things i have or havent tried, notes on do's or dont's, for styles, lengths, bangs, or things that work (or not) for my face, things to avoid, realy anything) is welcome!\n\nThankyou! :)",

Not a deal breaker, but it would help with using less foundation. I should add my skin doesn’t feel tingly or burning. It’s just..red. \n\n\\-probably my main concerns: my pores are HUGE! Mainly on my forehead and next to my nose. I feel like using BHA, retinol and an oil cleansee has been helping keep my sebaceous filaments on my nose under control-ish, but I hate how huge the rest of my pores look. \n\nHere’s the products I’m currently using:\n\n\\- BoJ oil cleanser (night only)\n\n\\-cetaphil gentle cleaner (morning and night)\n\n\\-corsx hyaluronic acid serum (morning and night)\n\n\\-BoJ Glow Serum (morning and night)\n\n\\-Corsx hylaronic intensive cream (morning and night)\n\n\\-rotated through the week with rest nights: corsx retinol and BHA power liquid\n\nAny suggestions of what to change?

I used Garnier Fructis Curl Nourish shampoo and conditioner, It’s a 10 leave-in, Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream, Garnier Fructis Curl Scrunch Gel, and Garnier Fructis hairspray. \n\nPic 2 is day 2. I rinsed with Garnier Fructis Curl Nourish conditioner only and re-scrunched with gel and hairspray.\n\nPic 3 is the same day as pic 2, about 8 hours later. The top layers became flat and frizzy. I live in a very humid city in Texas.\n\nI think I may have mixed porosity hair (some high, some low), but I’m not sure. I did CGM a few years ago and had similar issues, though my curls had slightly more definition and looked healthier then. At that time I was very blonde.\n\nOver the past year I started using heat again, so I’m guessing there’s some damage. I got a cut a few months ago and have only used heat a handful of times since. I only wash with shampoo 2-3 times a week. I use a microfiber towel or T-shirt and plop. I sleep with it up at night and rewet in the morning. I do olaplex and clarify with bumble and bumble Sunday shampoo every 2 weeks.  hair feels soft and healthy at first, but once the humidity hits it doesn’t hold up through the day.\n\nLooking for advice on humidity control, how to tell and treat mixed porosity, why the top layers fall flat and frizz first, and whether this could be moisture overload vs needing protein.",

Now that I have a good length, straightening it all the time was not working out and I started my curly journey. I am relatively new to my natural hair but get pretty good hair and wash days every now and then. \n\nThrough it all, frizz is my one problem I’ve not been able to get rid of. I have tried various things but none seem to be working. I’m thinking it’s the products I need to change. The first and second pics are right after finishing my routine one day that I felt was my best yet. The pics after that, while not in the same wash cycle, are how my hair looks like in day 2 or 3. While some definition is there, frizz just makes me disheartened and ruins the hair. Can anybody please help me to get rid of frizz and make my hair look hydrated? I wouldn’t mind trading in a bit of definition for less frizz and more hydration.\n\nI shampoo twice a week with a clarifying shampoo every once. Routine after goes like this:\n\nConditioner and wait for 5 mins and then brush through while waiting. After rinsing, I apply Marc anthony strictly curls leave-in. Then SC curl cream. Then NYM’s curl talk gel after which I brush style and scrunch. Most of the time I use a diffuser to dry my hair. Light oil to SOTC. ",

Nizoral shampoo hasn’t helped, no dandruff shampoos or ordinary dry scalp shampoos have helped, oiling doesn’t help without an infeasible amount of consistency and frequency, all sorts of natural hair masks (including raw fucking eggs!) haven’t helped, and I strongly don’t believe it’s dandruff or seb derm as it feels very dry, flakes are very fine and white and powdery. Went to a dermatologist recently for another reason (MBP is a bitch) and got prescribed a course of bettamousse and coal tar shampoo (to be used 1x weekly). I’m yet to get on the bettamousse but I’ve applied short courses of weaker steroids on my scalp to no avail. Coal tar has definitely been good, post-use my hair looks denser and fuller and cleaner. No flakes visible even up close. But they are there and continue to build up over the days again. \n\nSide note: I haven’t tried jojoba oil before, I’m planning on doing so. ",
