      "content": "Hi all, new here and will take all the advice I can get!\n\nBackstory: I have a giant exam on Friday I’m supposed to be studying for, so like any rational person I got side tracked on the internet for HOURS.\n\nI was steaming a shirt in my bathroom to de-wrinkle it, when I noticed the teeny little curl (pic 3, the one that started it all). My hair does that a lot with humidity, but I never thought beyond that. I’ve said for years I have stick straight hair, but alas, here we are 😂 I’ve always wanted \\*not\\* straight, flat hair, so I clung to that hope/urge to procrastinate. \n\nI immediately found this subreddit and started scrolling. Then googling. Then putting strands of hair in a glass of water. \n\nTurns out I have low porosity hair, which makes a lot of sense. I never moisturize my hair (as clearly evidenced in photo 2, pre-experiment) because it gets oily so quickly, but the internet tells me that’s because it’s not absorbing the heavy products I’d try on it every other month or so. I’d get annoyed that it made my hair oily, and go back to no moisture, only to try again with a super heavy product when I decided to combat the follicular dehydration again. And the cycle continued. \n\nI decided to put off my responsibilities further and go to Walmart to find a low porosity friendly leave in conditioner. I don’t know if this one for sure qualifies, but it was grad-school budget friendly, so I rolled with it. I always brush my hair essentially flat to my scalp right after I shower, but this time I used the leave in conditioner and scrunched my hair rather than brushing it out immediately. I used a microfiber towel I usually use when washing my face to scrunch more. It looked wavy (and probably is just wavy) and I figured it was just texture from the scrunching. \n\nI waited it out though! I’m usually a constant play-with-my-hair-er, so it was brutal trying not to touch it while it dried, but when I checked it out after studying a bit, I found a full on curl?! (Is that a curl? A wave? I honestly have no idea what it classifies as, I have no idea what I’m doing. The rest is just wavy for sure, but the first photo is of my golden child chunk of hair 😂)\n\nWhatever it is, it feels like it’s not from scrunching, and I now have so much enthusiasm and so little knowledge on how to keep making progress here. \n\nSorry for the long winded post, I’m just genuinely so jazzed that my hair is doing anything, and I figured maybe someone here would have advice!\n\nRoutine: native strengthening shampoo + conditioner, not your mother’s leave in conditioner ",

I have a combination of wavy and curly hair I think but I straightened it ever since I could think of because I just didn’t know how to deal with it right, but I really wanna learn! All tips are appreciated!\n\nMy routine:\n\n1. Washed my hair with curl shampoo, used a hair mask and then used curl conditioner. Washed it all out obviously.\n\n2. I applied the curl cream to soaking wet hair, spread it by brushing my hair. Then I scrunched a little and then scrunched the curl defining gel in and scrunched all the way to my head (I reapplied some water with a spray bottle because the tiktok tutorials said to keep the hair as wet as possible) (I used Bali curl products but I had this problem with other products before too so I don’t think the product is the issue haha)\n\n3.

I hate it so much I can’t stop crying. Not only is it blonde, there is white blonde, honey blonde, yellow blonde. I did not want to be blonde, I loved being a brunette. The original regrowth I wanted to fix still is there with a harsh line, I kept reminding her to not dye new sections and then she just wiped the bleach off with a towel.\n\nI feel so sad because for over a year I have been trying to grow my hair out from hair loss and my hair was so thin and above my shoulders. I also have been trying to grow out a peekaboo of platinum blonde I had at the back, and even if I get it professionally salon died back to brown, it always fades back to blonde or green or red or orange. I have to put semi permanent dye in every shower.\n\nI phoned the salon and they said they can add some lowlights in but I feel these were just wash out like that usually does with me, yes I use a safe shampoo and I wash my hair with cold water.

I just want to throw this out there: Redensyl, Capixyl, Procapil, rosemary oil, and caffeine are all marketed as having both empirical and anecdotal data suggesting they’re effective for treating hair/thinning loss, but I promise you most of that data is questionable at best. Lots of it is commissioned at the behest of those making these products or ingredients, so be weary.\n\nOn a personal note, I’ve tried just about every scalp serum with a solid ingredient list on the market for 6 months at least.\n\nNécessaire’s “The Scalp Serum” with 5% Capixyl is the **ONLY** one available on the market that makes a *noticeable* difference(even at that, it’s just enough to notice and nothing more). And it’s $48 for 1 fl oz. Not worth it. However, it’s the only thing I’ve found with a peptide concentration high enough to actually deliver it where it needs to go for uptake.\n\nEverything else you can get in stores just isn’t worth it. If you’ve got the budget and want to throw a little extra jazz in your haircare routine, go for it. It works nicely with topical minoxidil to help thicken hair and reduce shedding.",

      "title": "How do I get my hair to look/stay like this VS this (what am I doing wrong?)",
      "content": "Heyo, sorry for the long post, basically I want my hair to look like it does in the first 2 images (particularly the first) consistently/stay like that thru a day VS frizzy/undefined in 3/4 OR whatever tf it is in image 5, which seems to be most frequent. \n\nFor context: 21, Central FL (hot+humidaf), healthy scalp, high porosity (i think?), 3a-3c(?), not thin but def not dense/thick, and very very fine hair (super fine strands). Cold water=130ppm Hot=200+ ppm\n\nHair was rlly thin two years ago (thank god it’s not that bad anymore) and only started caring about my hair like that the last year. \n\nIm not too sure what my issues really come down to, but I think my hierarchy of needs for products is:      1. **Lightweight** 2. **Deep/lasting moisture** 3. **Anti-frizz** 4. **Growth/repair** 5. **Heat protection**\n\n# Products \n\n**\\*SHAMPOO\\***\n\n\\-I use either ***L’Oréal Elvive curls*** OR ***As I Am Castor*** for shampoo, and quite happy with both but leaning towards as I am I think. I typically coat my entire hair/head, leave on for 15 seconds, and rinse out. Double cleanse, lukewarm water. ** **\n\n**\\*COWASH\\***\n\n\\-I use the ***As I Am Castor*** cowash, and I’m pretty satisfied with it, but seeing as in a 7-9 day period I sometimes cowash twice before shampooing again, I’m considering adding in a different one to use alongside, or trying new ones out in general, or even looking at hair masks, which btw, please explain the difference between them and a cowash, and what are overnight hair masks? \n\n**\\*RINSE OUT CONDITIONER\\***\n\n\\-I used to use ***Shea Moisture Curl &amp; Shine*** and liked it, but decided to experiment and have tried a few different things. For right now (I know this is bad), I just use ***Kinky Curly Knot Today*** for my rinse out. Try my best to rake/apply to ends only, leave in for \\~3 mins, rinse out. Was considering trying ***Creme of Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment***\n\n**\\*LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER\\***\n\n**-**I’ve been using either ***Pillow Soft Curls*** or ***Kinky Curly Knot Today*** for leave in conditioner, and apply when hair is wet, not damp or dry (not soaking wet either though, should I?). I think I like KC more than PSC, and previously used base skala but felt it dried out really really quick. KC gives me some nice clumps and doesn’t ever feel crunchy if pure air drying, and still leaves some bounce and is very lightweight. Pillow soft has been pretty decent too I think, only been using for the last week-ish though. Considering trying ***curlsmith*** \n\n**\\*MOUSSE\\***\n\n**-**I only recently started using mousse and realized I’d been applying it incorrectly/using bad ones. I’m very new to mousse still, though, and absolutely taking recommendations AND specifically recommendations on how to apply. I used to use ***Shea Moisture Frizz Free Curl Mousse*** but switched to ***The Doux Def Texture Foam*** and like it quite a bit better. I typically apply it to my hands, lightly rub together, and then gloss my hair, and then rake, and then lightly scrunch (directly after applying leave in conditioner); considering using ***curlsmith***\n\n**\\*LEAVE-IN OIL/PROTECTANT/SERUM (?)\\***\n\n\\-I don’t usually use any, but I want to start, but don’t know what to use exactly, and right now I use ***Camille Rose Rosemary Oil Strengthening Leave In Conditioner***; I know it says conditioner but it really is more like an oil solution. I suck at applying it I feel, sometimes use too much, and can’t figure out at what stage of the process I should use it. \n\n**\\*PRE-POO + OVERNIGHT OIL TREATMENT\\***\n\n**-**i definitely notice and love it when I do pre shampoo, but I’m not sure what oils/products to use, and don’t do it every time. I currently use ***African Pride “Feel-It” Formula*** for pre poo (10-30 mins). Also any info on overnight treatments, what products/oils, do it or don’t, if so then before shampoo days only, or also cowash days?\n\n**\\*POMADE / BALM\\***\n\n**-**I also don’t really use this, but occasionally I will for spots that aren’t cooperating, or if I have to just get up and leave, or to even refresh certain spots. I use ***The Doux Bonita Afro Balm*** and just apply to strands/ends, and then scrunch/style and go.\n\n**\\*OTHERS/MISC\\***\n\n**-**I haven’t tried: hair spray, dry shampoo, hair mask, custard, gel, lotion, definers, protein and or acidic treatments/products, hair tonic, hair milks, thermal protectants, curl refreshers, pre shampoo specific products, detangling specific products, rice water or protein stuff, actual serums, or curl creams.\n\n# Styling/Routine\n\n**\\*STYLING\\***\n\nHonestly, I think I suck at styling, and I really need a video to see how I should be styling my hair and applying products, particularly after getting out the shower. I sometimes use a diffuser especially if I’m leaving soon, but it leaves my hair either too dry (3/4 pic) or like pic 5. I typically gloss then rake products in, scrunch after applying mousse, and air dry, and then pick/fluff with my hands (rlly bad habit I know)\n\n\\***ROUTINE\\***\n\n**D1**: pre poo w/ oil, shampoo double cleanse, RO cond., LE cond., mousse, air dry/diffuse halfway, (sometimes) rosemary oil thingie, air dry rest of way\n\n**D2**: Same as D1 without prepoo/shampoo\n\n**D3:** (depending on how it looks) sometimes the exact same as day 2, other times will opt out of mousse and/or Camille rosemary oil thingie. \n\n**D4:** no oil, rarely mousse, sometimes won’t use LE cond or just use less of it. Sometimes will skip straight to D5 process (cowash day) \n\n**D5**: cowash, and then the exact same as D2\n\n**D6**: rinse out conditioner, leave in conditioner (usually less), sometimes mousse \n\n**D7+:** usually just go with the flow, as in observe my hair and feel it, and then either decide to restart the cycle n shampoo, or cowash, or continue just using rinse out+leave in or sometimes just rinse out. Just depends but tbh, ***I don’t know what I’m doing at all, I need recs/feedback and guidance/tips**** *\n\n*\\*—sometimes go 8-9 days between shampoo but cowash again at some point*\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBasically I just want my hair to always look like the first 2 pics and get it to actually last like that throughout the day, and my hair usually looks like the last image most of the time. I don’t know if I have damage, frizz issues, breakage, too thin of hair, if I’m forcing curls, using the wrong products, or simply styling/applying products wrong. I’m also looking for to repair hair + \n\nIm looking for any and all product recs (whether I use the type of product or not), most definitely looking for styling/application methods and recs, and also an explanation of wtf is going on with my hair? Generally any thoughts, comments, opinions, recs, tips tricks etc. all welcomed, thank you!\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nHow can I get my hair to be like the first pic consistently and make it last; what am I doing wrong/what is happening, what types of products do I need, what specific recommendations, any styling/application + routine tips? Thank you for reading!",

      "content": "21M Asian looking for full routine FOR PIH + product recs (low irritation) \\[don't want anything with any potentially LT damaging effects like accutane for e.g.\\].\n\n**Issues:**\n\n1. PIH from old acne (main issue) (mainly I have the issue of popping / scratching at the dead skin after acne which I know NOT to do, and will try to not do anymore). No pitted scarring, just darker spots that I'd like to remove.\n2. alongside the PIH, I'd like to also lighten my general skin tone slightly (paler).\n3. oily nose /sebaceous filaments (millia I believe)\n4. Noticeably more visible pores on cheeks.\n\n**Context:**\n\n* So, currently, I don't think I have any significant issue with getting new pimples (maybe just one a week or less (I don't really notice it)). I have tried skincare to fix my PIH issue in the past couple years on and off but have sort of given up, but I'm trying again now.\n* I'm also indoors like 99% of the time with minimal sunlight exposure so I haven't really been using sunscreen (though I'm thinking of using like a lightweight, not too oily/heavy asian sunscreen now).\n\n**Current routine (minimal):** AM/PM I just wash my face with warm water and or use a warm towel and rub very gently on face. Then PM I use a foaming cleanser while showering (pea size).\n\n**Past products I tried:** (products are correct, but the results take with a grain of salt because I don't remember super clearly).\n\n1. COSRX Pure Vitamin C Serum 23% (I think it was too strong; couldn’t use daily)\n2. Niacinamide serum (don’t remember brand; used on/off)\n3. Skin1004 Centella “brightening ampoule” (not sure it did anything)\n4. Roundlab moisturiser + cleanser. Also tried some man:yo oil cleanser rarely maybe once a month (mostly for fun).\n\nI've also tried using a silk pillowcase, but didn't like how if I wore products it felt sticky to the surface and felt like the side of my face touching the pillowcase would heat up quickly / faster than my cotton pillowcase. (I did try putting the products on well in advance before sleeping and didn't put too much (I think)). Are silk / silver pillowcases actually worth using for its \"anti microbial activities\" because I didn't really like it, idk.\n\nI also now use a seperate face towel to dry my face after shower which I use for 1-3 days before using a different one.\n\n# So, I've also been consulting ChatGPT.\n\n**So, I've also been consulting ChatGPT** past couple days about this to get some advice, but this post is mainly to ask the community and actual people for advice as ChatGPT can hallucinate. What it basically recommended was this:\n\n* Base for PIH + acne prevention: **azelaic acid (15–20%) + a retinoid (adapalene 0.1%)**\n* For nose/filaments: **BHA (salicylic acid 2%)** on nose only a few nights/week\n* Add a light moisturizer + lightweight sunscreen (non-greasy)\n* Use hydrocolloid patches to stop picking\n\n**My questions are:**\n\n1. Is there any way to 'test' products for cheap/free for a bit before buying in case I react to it strongly? I've thought of probably making a list of products that I might buy and just going out to a store to test them out for a week straight before deciding to buy or something (not sure if theres an easier way).\n2. What product stack should I use in the AM/PM to fix the **aforementioned 4 issues above (mainly the PIH).** How to store that product, how much/often to use and in AM or PM. And should I try buy korean products? Idk why but I feel more inclined to buy Japanese/Korean products over Western ones (I think mainly due to how much glaze those products typically recieve online).\n3. I read this reddit post and it mentioned a lot of PIH ingredients like (vitamin c, retinoids, azelaic acid, arbutin, tranexamic acid, kojic acid etc). So I'm a bit unsure what I actually should be looking for in a product. Which ingredient is MOST important for me to be looking for?\n4.

I've heard that you should cut out added sugars and that \"your skin is a reflection of your gut health\", so i should be eating foods good for my gut.",

And broke me out occasionally But since I was so clueless I used it up to about 4-5 months because I thought the squeaky clean feeling was a good sign (IT WASNT!). For now I don't want expensive products and extended skincare like serums, toners and all. Just need an effective cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen, that's it! This is the skincare routine I'm aiming to buy around this month or next month. I'm probably not gonna change my decision to buy these since it took me a lot of digging and understanding my personal skin's feelings but i would like to hear a more variety and wider perspective of recommendations and your thoughts too. I know some of these are cheap but my skin is young and i Just want to maintain it and control my break outs even though I know hormonal acne and break outs won't be fully curable in my current age. :)\n\nFyi : i have combo to oily acne prone skin, climate is extremely hot dry and occasionally humid (Raj. Jodhpur weather)",

So i started following a routine after a brief research and a consultation from a dermat. \n\nIt's been almost two weeks since I started and I see visible pores and tiny pimples along with whiteheads forming especially around the skin beside my nose as you can see. I hate whiteheads especially because they cause scars on my face after they heal.\n\nThis is my routine and the products that I use. \n\n1)Glowriance skin renewing face wash \n\n2) minimalist 10%  niacinamide  serum\n\n3)Neutrogena Hydroboost gel based moisturizer \n\n4)Re-equip ultra matte dry sunscreen(blue bottle)\n\nI have an appointment with my dermat this weekend.

I've been scrapping remnants out of my last bottle all week.\n\nAny recommendations for a replacement? Folks are saying that Cetaphil Redness Relieving Night Moisturizer is the same product but I'm also seeing that it's causing breakouts, so that worries me a bit. Plus it's more expensive and by the same parent company, and that just annoys me.\n\nMy current routine:\n\nMorning: Keihl's Ultra Facial Cream (in the winter/as-needed only) followed by Aveeno's Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer with 30SPF (year-round)\n\nNight: Cocokind's oil to milk cleanser, sometimes Cocokind's Advanced Care Retinol, and then Differin's night moisturizer.\n\nI love my skin as it is with this routine (no dryness or breakouts), I don't wear make-up, and I'd love a lower price point like the Differin so I can continue to splurge on my other stuff. But maybe that's not possible :(",

      "title": "Hair loss research focused on chemistry for decades because we misunderstood the mechanics of growth.",
      "content": "For decades, hair loss research focused almost entirely on chemistry. Hormones, blood flow, growth factors, receptors etc. That focus made sense, because we thought we already understood the mechanics of hair growth.\n\nThe model most of us learned was simple: cells divide at the base of the follicle, stack upward, and push the hair out. Like toothpaste. If growth slowed, the assumption was that the “push” weakened.\n\n*That model turned out to be incomplete.*\n\nIn late 2025, researchers [using live 3D imaging of human hair follicles noticed something odd](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65143-x). Cells in the outer root sheath were not static support tissue. They were moving, slowly. In coordinated, spiral patterns. Not upward, but downward along the follicle wall.\n\n*That movement generated force.*\n\nWhen researchers blocked cell division in the hair bulb, growth slowed only modestly. When they disrupted actin dynamics, the machinery cells use to move and generate tension, hair growth collapsed. \n\nSo we can say hair growth is not mainly driven by being pushed from below but is actively pulled upward by surrounding tissue acting like a mechanical motor.\n\n**This explains several things that chemistry alone never quite accounted for.**\n\nWhy follicles with normal hormone levels still fail.  \nWhy two people with similar blood markers can have completely different outcomes.  \nWhy some follicles “give up” even when nutrients and circulation are adequate.\n\n*A motor can weaken even when fuel is present.*\n\nHair loss research leaned so heavily into chemistry because the mechanical side was invisible. You cannot see force generation in static histology. You need live tissue, time, and movement. Until recently, we did not have the tools to watch follicles behave.\n\nThis doesn’t make hormones irrelevant. Androgens still change follicle biology. Inflammation still matters. Vascular supply still matters.  \nBut they may be acting upstream, altering the follicle’s ability to maintain this mechanical pulling system.\n\n[If the motor degrades, the hair shaft thins.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh3273) If coordination fails, cycles shorten. If force drops below a threshold, the follicle enters a resting state and does not recover easily.\n\nWhat’s striking is how familiar this pattern is elsewhere in biology. Muscle wasting is not just about protein levels. Bone loss is not just about calcium. Function fails when mechanical signaling breaks down.\n\n*Hair follicles appear to follow the same rule.*\n\nThis also reframes why timing matters so much. Once a follicle’s mechanical system degrades past a certain point, stimulating chemistry alone may not restore function. You are no longer supporting a system. You are trying to rebuild one.\n\nNone of this means we suddenly have a cure. But it does explain why progress has been uneven for decades. We were trying to tune chemistry while misunderstanding the machine.\n\nSometimes science stalls not because the problem is unsolvable, but because we were looking at the wrong layer. And sometimes the most ordinary things, like hair growing from skin, turn out to be mechanically stranger than we assumed.",

I barley put any product in then. Since then I keep it short and I’m much more grey and It feels like it is always just a tangled mess. Sometimes I will get a nice forehead curl (picture in white shirt), most days it’s like the final photo.\n\nI live in a very hard water area but I’m not sure if this is the issue.\n\nRoutine:\n\nWash daily with Aussie miracle moist shampoo. I know it has sulphates but I think I need these due to hard water?\n\nConditioner daily: Aussie miracle moist. I realise this now had silicones so should likely go!\n\nLeave hair wet. Then apply Mielle Pommegranate curl smoothie with hands. Then use a very wide tooth comb\n\n(+\\\\- some hairspray at this stage)\n\nAir dry 10-15 mins. Then diffuse\n\nI sleep on a cotton pillow and my hair is a a genuine birds nest each morning, so I wash/ apply products daily. \n\nMy questions (I’m Uk based so any local product suggestions welcome)\n\n\\- what to do about hard water? Should I chelate maybe every 3 weeks then use a clarifying sulphate containing shampoo once a week, or more?\n\n\\- Should I switch up the curl smoothie for a gel?\n\n\\- I think I need to add in a low poo option for lost washes \n\n\\- Should I give up? :(",

A budget friendly Spf 40 lip balm.

WRP but when i'd need it. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nPlum 5% Niacinamide serum: Worked well for controlling oil and reducing the dark spots to some extent. I had been using it since it was launched &amp; it was my 3rd bottle but lately noticed that it didn't work like before. It could be the quality issue (have noticed that many Indian brands degrade the quality once the product gets popular) or my skin got used to it.

      "content": "Age 30, caucasian, live in Naarm, Australia.\n\nSkin concerns: rosacea, enlarged pores/sebaceous filaments, dehydration. Not a concern but I do enjoy “anti ageing” things. Even though I’m beginning to disagree with “anti ageing” as a concept and think its a bit of a scam. But I’m still obviously obsessed with my skin. Is the root of this obsession patriarchal? Maybe. Or maybe its as simple as I enjoy rubbing slime on my face. \n\nAM:\n\nBioderma Sensibio H2O Soothing Micellar Water Cleanser with Unicharm Silcot Uru-uru Cotton Sponge Touch Moisturizing Cotton Puff Pads\n\nShenzen Light Idea Red/NIR light panel (but honestly I slack so hard with this)\n\nNIOD SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE 3 ENZYME MIST\n\nPaula’s Choice 7% Ectoin + Hyaluronic Acid Milky Hydrating Serum \n\niUNIK Beta-Glucan Power Moisture Serum\n\nAestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream (the formula changed, but I have tried literally everything and this moisturiser is unmatched. Potentially too heavy for the AM) \n\nSPF — I was using naked Sundays mineral, which was unmatched before I found out it had an spf rating of like 2???? Now I am layering 2: \n\n\\- Avène Sun Intense Protect Fluid Fragrance-Free SPF50+ Sunscreen (this is meant to block blue light too)\n\n\\- Bioderma Photoderm Nude Touch Mineral SPF50+ Light Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\nBioderma Sensibio Micellar Cleansing Oil (I also like Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil and it’s usually on sale) \n\nQV Ceramides Cleanser\n\nPaula’s choice 10% Niacinamide Booster \n\niUNIK Beta-Glucan Power Moisture Serum\n\nTO Multi-Peptide + Copper Peptides 1% Serum (Previously was using Medik8 advanced which I loved but its $$. I was considering swapping out both the PC niacinamide booster and TO peptides for Maelove peptide squad)\n\nAestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream\n\nFinacea (azelaic acid)\n\nLanolips 101\n\nPC BHA on my nose sometimes \n\nWeekly I do sheet masks - any of the skin1004, Mediheal madecassoside, beauty of joseon centella are my faves. \n\nI’ve tried to incorporate antioxidants, humectants, lots of barrier repairing ingredients, and peptides for collagen stimulation. My skin won’t tolerate vitamin c, retinoids, and many many things. The niacinamide, peptides and avene sunscreen are almost too much. I also have airyday pretty in zinc but its too dark for my skin and sometimes irritating as well. The sebaceous filaments on my nose will not go away. I am open to all opinions, suggestions and product recommendations. Especially sunscreen and especially something to get rid of sebaceous filaments. Would be happy to cut down on serums. Am unsure if I am missing key things in my routine.\n\nAlso, I am skeptical if peptides do much. Treatments like needling, lasers, etc are way better for collagen stimulation. But **(TMI warning--skip to rating my routine if you just want that)** as I mentioned at the start, I’m currently battling the idea of wanting to look young and choice feminism as a whole. I've already decided I wont be getting botox, threads or plastic surgery. But where is the line? We all get old and die and I don't want to see wrinkles as ugly. I've been shocked hearing people say getting a face lift is ageing gracefully. What could be spent on treatments (not that I can afford them) could be spent on therapy to help me accept ageing. And to add to the weirdness, (TW) after seeing so much from the Epstein files it's opened my eyes to how ingrained *it* is in our culture. Literally makes me sick. But I still want to glow and lather my face with things. Don't we all want to be forever young? Does anyone else feel me on this? I shouldn't feel guilty for wanting to look my best. I shouldn't judge myself for how I look either. And I certainly don't judge others for either, as I participate in the beauty industry too. But I've definitely started to wonder if its healthy and where the want comes from. On the other hand, I also want to feel healthy. Skin is our largest organ, it's good to take care of it on some level. I enjoy the ritual of skincare and nerding out about it. Skincare is a female dominated industry too, which has its pros. Remove the patriarchy and looks must still matter in some human way right? Wtf is \"ageing gracefully\"? Idk. Full disclosure when my sister is qualified I will probs still do all the treatments for cheap lol. So yea please rate my routine (bonus if u have deeper insights too) :-)",

I can sometimes wash every three days, but by the third day it looks terrible (even with dry shampoo) and I wear it in a bun. ",
