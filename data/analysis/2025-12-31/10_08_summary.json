      "content": "To start off on routine, i have been using New Wash by hairstory as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner for about a year now. (I hadnt used shampoo and conditioner for a YEAR 😭)\n\nI would also use their balm to style. Occasionally i used curlsmith hold me softly and in shower gel, as well as not your mothers curl talk foam to refresh. Id let my hair air dry, sleep with it in a bun (which is why its so frizzy all the time), and rewet it every morning using a bit of the styling products. \n\nLast year, i went to a new hairdresser who recommended new wash to me. I liked what it did to my curls, so i got what she used on me. Unfortunately, she didnt explain that it was a cowash (hairstory doesnt really explain either) and essentially framed it as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner. I was not aware of how cowashes work or how they should be used (i am still confused tbh)\n\nHere i am, a year later, with insane scalp build up and significantly thinner hair (said hair dresser also decided to give me a mullet i did not ask for 🥲). \n\nBefore this, i was putting in a lot of effort into my hair. I used hairtage for shampoo and conditioner, would use not your mothers mousse, the curl smith products i mentioned, and Silk by biosilk. i cant remember if i air dried or diffused in the fourth photo. \n\nFirst photo is most recent using hairology, miss jessie’s leave in and a curl cream, and diffused. Second photo is when i still used just new wash and was after my most recent cut. Third is an average day side profile while still using new wash. Fourth is my routine before new wash. Fifth is what it looked like on an average day. \n\nI think my hair is 2c/3a high porosity(pls confirm or deny) and now it is low density (it used to be so thick 😭). \n\nIm looking for advice and recommendations for shampoo and conditioner. I need to tackle my scalp build up above everything else. \nI also want my curls to stay curled longer. I think i will try using mousse but maybe not gel due to the weight. I think i will get one of those curl shaping brushes as well.\nIve also never found a solution for sleeping with my hair. Every bonnet ive tried has scrunched up my hair or has slipped off at night, but putting it up is causing so much damage. I cant use a satin pillow case for sensory issues. \n\nSuggestions welcome ❤️\n",

I also tried the Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer and it broke me out with cystic acne. I recently tried using the Cetaphil moisturizing cream but I have bumps all over my face now which feel like sandpaper.\n\nIf it helps to know, I previously used the Cerave hydrating facial cleanser and recently switched to the vanicream gentle facial cleanser for sensitive skin. \n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for daily facial moisturizers to use instead?

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I started taking Hims chewables (1.2 mg Fin, 3 mg Min, + biotin and other supplements) in July. Was seeing decent results. \n\nI had an appointment with my dermatologist around the 3 month mark and he recommended switching to dut instead of fin, so I stopped taking the Hims and started 0.5 mg Dut and 5% topical min. Been on that for about 3 months and think the growth has slowed down. My concern is that I haven’t been applying the topical min consistently (probably 4-5x a week). \n\nWould you all recommend staying on the oral dut and adding an oral min, then just try to be more consistent with topical min? I have seen locklab 4-in-1 but that’s only .1 dut. Can I take that in conjunction with my 0.5 dut Rx? I think I’ve realized that an oral medication will be my easiest and most consistent method of treatment but understand topical min might be “better”.\n\nAdditionally, my regimen the last couple weeks has included Bhringraj oil and other Ayurvedic ingredients 2-3x a week (leave in overnight). While I’m not expecting these to actually regrow my hair, I do think they are helping provide a better texture and feel to my hair. I don’t see any reason to take this out of my routine since it’s only a couple times a week.\n\nAppreciate your suggestions and advice!",

No matter how loose I tie my hair I get headaches.\n\nI have a crazy cowlick on the right side of my forehead (which results in my irregular hairline when my hair is pulled back) too and this makes managing short hairstyles difficult. I attached a photo of me when my hair was short for reference. I have a big forehead that I'd probably want to cover a bit with bangs like before but I need advice.\n\nShould I lop this mop off or keep trying to make it work?

I thought I had low porosity because of the float test but apparently that test is flawed. I took the quiz and it said medium porosity. I don’t color my hair. I think I have low-medium density.\n\nMy current routine is:\n\nShampoo: Acure vivacious volume shampoo or Remedy (as needed for scalp issues \n\nConditioner: odele fragrance free\n\nSilk pillowcase at night\n\nI dry the roots/bangs partially or completely. I use seen serum or heat protecting crème as a heat protectant 90% of the time \n\nThe picture is what my hair looks like air dried. It looks better when I brush it but then I get the “your hair is wavy but you brushed it straight” look. \n\nI have tried the fully curly girl method with gel (I don’t want to plop bc of scalp issues), but it doesn’t ever hold really\n\nThank you in advance for your help.

      "content": "21M with oily, acne-prone skin.\n\nMy skincare journey started around August 2023. I began using only **Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Cleanser** and **Pilgrim Vitamin C serum**. I did **not** use any moisturizer or sunscreen at that time.\n\nAfter the Vitamin C finished, I switched to **Minimalist Niacinamide serum**, but I noticed my skin actually got worse. Over time, I kept starting and stopping skincare randomly. For almost 2 years, I was basically just using the salicylic acid cleanser without proper moisturizing or sun protection.\n\nAfter researching, I now realize that skipping **moisturizer and sunscreen** probably damaged my skin barrier.\n\nI stopped all skincare for 1–2 months and recently restarted. I don’t plan to visit a dermatologist due to bad past experiences and lack of good dermatologists in my city.\n\n# Current Routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Deconstruct Gel Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Minimalist Vitamin K + Retinal Under Eye Cream (for dark circles)\n\nFrom my research, a **simple 3-step routine** seems best:\n\n* AM: Cleanser + Moisturizer + Sunscreen\n* PM: Cleanser + Moisturizer (+ retinol later)\n\nI’m thinking of **changing my moisturizer**, since I’m currently using a body lotion on my face.\n\nI’m not in a rush at all — even if it takes **1–2 years**, I just want my skin to heal properly.\n\n**Looking for suggestions on:**\n\n* Whether my current routine makes sense\n* If I should stop or limit salicylic acid\n* Moisturizer recommendations for oily, acne-prone skin\n* When (or if) I should introduce retinol\n\nAny help would be really appreciated 🙏",

If there's any products you can recommend I'd be grateful! \n\nCurrent routine is just head and shoulders as I have scalp issues and I just got the ordinary scalp moisturiser which seems to help with that aspect and for styling just a cheap styling cream by L'Oréal and I just let my hair air dry \n\nThank you:)",
