      "content": "To start off on routine, i have been using New Wash by hairstory as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner for about a year now. (I hadnt used shampoo and conditioner for a YEAR 😭)\n\nI would also use their balm to style. Occasionally i used curlsmith hold me softly and in shower gel, as well as not your mothers curl talk foam to refresh. Id let my hair air dry, sleep with it in a bun (which is why its so frizzy all the time), and rewet it every morning using a bit of the styling products. \n\nLast year, i went to a new hairdresser who recommended new wash to me. I liked what it did to my curls, so i got what she used on me. Unfortunately, she didnt explain that it was a cowash (hairstory doesnt really explain either) and essentially framed it as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner. I was not aware of how cowashes work or how they should be used (i am still confused tbh)\n\nHere i am, a year later, with insane scalp build up and significantly thinner hair (said hair dresser also decided to give me a mullet i did not ask for 🥲). \n\nBefore this, i was putting in a lot of effort into my hair. I used hairtage for shampoo and conditioner, would use not your mothers mousse, the curl smith products i mentioned, and Silk by biosilk. i cant remember if i air dried or diffused in the fourth photo. \n\nFirst photo is most recent using hairology, miss jessie’s leave in and a curl cream, and diffused. Second photo is when i still used just new wash and was after my most recent cut. Third is an average day side profile while still using new wash. Fourth is my routine before new wash. Fifth is what it looked like on an average day. \n\nI think my hair is 2c/3a high porosity(pls confirm or deny) and now it is low density (it used to be so thick 😭). \n\nIm looking for advice and recommendations for shampoo and conditioner. I need to tackle my scalp build up above everything else. \nI also want my curls to stay curled longer. I think i will try using mousse but maybe not gel due to the weight. I think i will get one of those curl shaping brushes as well.\nIve also never found a solution for sleeping with my hair. Every bonnet ive tried has scrunched up my hair or has slipped off at night, but putting it up is causing so much damage. I cant use a satin pillow case for sensory issues. \n\nSuggestions welcome ❤️\n",

      "content": "I don't know what type of zits they are, but I get them when I've eaten too much whey dairy and from hormones at certain points into my cycle if the conditions are right. \n\nThey are SO painful. I just had one that it hurt to just graze my hand across my face and I could feel it when I smiled. I can see the skin stretching from the swelling that is ensuing. It was not a white head, and if I had used a warm compress that would have been better.\n\nI did spot treatment all day and then applied some pressure and the pressurized pus came shooting out. You would think it would be more from the level of pain the zit caused, but I think it's just the depth in the skin that the pimple started to brew. It had caused so much hyperpigmentation even before I popped it. I cleaned it and have been putting hydrocolloid bandages on it until there is no more gunk to draw out.\n\nI guess the point of my story is that I don't know what kind of pimples these are, that they are extremely painful and sensitive to touch, they are very swollen, and don't come to a head, but can be popped carefully and heal better once efficiently popped, and eliminating the pus and drawing out the gunk with a patch reduces the swelling.\n\nI feel like leaving it to fester on its own increases damage go the skin and pore by allowing swelling and inflammation to grow.",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

      "content": "Hi all, 35M. I have taken fin/min off and on for a few years and only recently really been dedicated to taking regular medication for it. I started taking Hims chewables (1.2 mg Fin, 3 mg Min, + biotin and other supplements) in July. Was seeing decent results. \n\nI had an appointment with my dermatologist around the 3 month mark and he recommended switching to dut instead of fin, so I stopped taking the Hims and started 0.5 mg Dut and 5% topical min. Been on that for about 3 months and think the growth has slowed down. My concern is that I haven’t been applying the topical min consistently (probably 4-5x a week). \n\nWould you all recommend staying on the oral dut and adding an oral min, then just try to be more consistent with topical min? I have seen locklab 4-in-1 but that’s only .1 dut. Can I take that in conjunction with my 0.5 dut Rx? I think I’ve realized that an oral medication will be my easiest and most consistent method of treatment but understand topical min might be “better”.\n\nAdditionally, my regimen the last couple weeks has included Bhringraj oil and other Ayurvedic ingredients 2-3x a week (leave in overnight). While I’m not expecting these to actually regrow my hair, I do think they are helping provide a better texture and feel to my hair. I don’t see any reason to take this out of my routine since it’s only a couple times a week.\n\nAppreciate your suggestions and advice!",

Doesn’t it damage the hair? \n\n\\- I rinsed the conditioner out with coldish water while scrunching\n\n\\- I kept my hair soaking wet and put a small amount of leave in (Garnier Ultra Doux Hair Food Smoothing Coconut and Macademia 3 in 1) and scrunched\n\n\\- Rewet my hair so it was soaking wet\n\n\\- Put mousse in without raking, only glazing the hair (Wella New Wave Curls &amp; Waves Mousse) and scrunched\n\n\\- Scrunched my hair using a microfiber towel then plopped for...tbh I forgot somewhere between 30 minutes to an hour.\n\n\\- Air dried my hair\n\nThe next morning after this whole routine and my hair was fully dry, It just looked how it looked when it was wet but frizzier and tangled, and there was no cast to scrunch out either. The thing is it stayed in the same clumps so it was way too thin looking not like fluffy pretty waves, and just not wearable to me.\n\nSo I had to brush out my hair, and in an attempt to reduce the poof, I put some serum (HASK CURL CARE – 5 in 1 Leave-in Spray) and a touch of pomade (suavetica). It looked ok for about two minutes but then the frizzy poofiness took over again, it’s like my hair immediately absorbed all of the serum instead of letting it sit on top of my hair to stay shiny, maybe I’m not using enough but I’m scared of my hair looking too oily.\n\nAlso I never understood how people don’t dry brush, my hair gets way too tangled overnight to not brush it out, even though I sleep on a silk pillowcase.\n\nPS if anyone wants to recommend products I can’t afford to spend more than like 10 dollars for a single product.\n\nI just feel at a loss doing this whole routine just for me to end up dry brushing my hair then it looks the same as how it does with no product or styling after the shower.",

My stretchy skin is not as thick and thus... eye shadows! ✨️\n\nI knew they'd likely be a thing for me as my mum also has them, she is considered a very attractive lady but it's her one biggest insecurity, as she's gotten older they've become more and more prominent and it greatly upsets her. I don't want to go down that path where it bothers me that much.\n\nI know it'll bother me if I grow older and I realise I could have done something lowly invasive to prevent them getting worse, but **if** there really isn't anything side from makeup or caffeine cream (cream does work wonders for me but never lasts long) or retinol (which also helped but I have *super* sensitive skin so caused a dreadful rash even at lose dose and low exposure), then I'd prefer to have that answer now and just learn to be ok with them.\n\nBecause then I can move from thinking \"can I stop this?\" into \"this is a part of who I am and thats ok\" which will be less damaging long term for my self image.\n\nSide note, I'm a little underweight, I weigh roughly 54kg and my height is around 5 foot 6. idk if more weight would make a difference at *all* but I am still trying to gain some weight regardless, for wellbeing.\n\nThanks!",

      "content": "21M with oily, acne-prone skin.\n\nMy skincare journey started around August 2023. I began using only **Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Cleanser** and **Pilgrim Vitamin C serum**. I did **not** use any moisturizer or sunscreen at that time.\n\nAfter the Vitamin C finished, I switched to **Minimalist Niacinamide serum**, but I noticed my skin actually got worse. Over time, I kept starting and stopping skincare randomly. For almost 2 years, I was basically just using the salicylic acid cleanser without proper moisturizing or sun protection.\n\nAfter researching, I now realize that skipping **moisturizer and sunscreen** probably damaged my skin barrier.\n\nI stopped all skincare for 1–2 months and recently restarted. I don’t plan to visit a dermatologist due to bad past experiences and lack of good dermatologists in my city.\n\n# Current Routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Deconstruct Gel Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Minimalist Vitamin K + Retinal Under Eye Cream (for dark circles)\n\nFrom my research, a **simple 3-step routine** seems best:\n\n* AM: Cleanser + Moisturizer + Sunscreen\n* PM: Cleanser + Moisturizer (+ retinol later)\n\nI’m thinking of **changing my moisturizer**, since I’m currently using a body lotion on my face.\n\nI’m not in a rush at all — even if it takes **1–2 years**, I just want my skin to heal properly.\n\n**Looking for suggestions on:**\n\n* Whether my current routine makes sense\n* If I should stop or limit salicylic acid\n* Moisturizer recommendations for oily, acne-prone skin\n* When (or if) I should introduce retinol\n\nAny help would be really appreciated 🙏",

      "content": "I’ve been struggling with pustules in the creases of my nose, inside my nose, and on my chin for the past year. I’ve seen two dermatologists.\n\nThe first dermatologist thought it could be seborrheic dermatitis and tried hydrocortisone cream first and ketoconazole cream paired with ketoconazole wash after. Neither of these helped. Then they said it could possibly be an atypical presentation of acne and tried doxycycline once a day for three months which briefly helped and then, after, amoxicillin twice a day for a month which helped a lot but only while I was on it.\n\nI moved and got established with a second dermatologist who is a contact dermatitis specialist. They said it was probably just acne and tried a higher dose of doxycycline twice a day for a month which kind of helped. Then I had a horrible break out and was told it was probably rosacea tried rositara gel. When it didn’t help, they discontinued the rositara gel and prescribed me doxycycline again. I had similar results as before, but after finishing that course of doxycycline, the pustules came back just as bad as before and then they said it could possibly be periorificial dermatitis and prescribed me tacrolimus cream which did not help at all. During my last appointment, they said it was probably just acne and rosacea combined.\n\nI had skin cultures taken and the dermatologist said nothing came back positive. I’ve also noticed an increase in typical acne. They started me on isotretinoin, which I’ve taken twice before a few years back. Hopefully this third round works…\n\nI’m just at a loss with my skin. Have any of you ever experienced or seen anything like this?\n\n\\*\\*TLDR:\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*I’ve been struggling with pustules in the creases of my nose, inside my nose, and on my chin for the past year.
