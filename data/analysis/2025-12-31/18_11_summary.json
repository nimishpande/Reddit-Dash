I’m trying to achieve even 10% of what she has.\n\nI am currently on day 3 after washing. My current routine for this week was: I shampoo with moisturizing curl talk shampoo, then I do Mielle rosemary mint strengthening hair mask. Then I do 3-in-1 Curl Talk conditioner and don’t fully wash it out and squish in a bit to my ends before exiting the shower.\n\nThen I praying hands Pattern styling custard and drag it through a bit on top.  I then use them bounce curl clips while diffusing on warm setting for heat and low intensity with minimal movement to set the curls. I fluff out the roots after dry with the bounce curl volume comb. I scrunch in Ouai hair oil once dry.\n\nToday I sectioned my hair out while using tresemme keratin smooth weightless anti-frizz finishing spray at the roots and using the bounce curl volume comb diffusing where I sprayed after using the comb on low cold setting to set the spray.\n\nI’m pretty happy with the results, but looking for more tips if anyone has any? \n\nI may just need a hair cut. I just can’t seem the back to achieve the same volume at the back that I get around my face. At the side part it seems flat as well.

      "content": "To start off on routine, i have been using New Wash by hairstory as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner for about a year now. (I hadnt used shampoo and conditioner for a YEAR 😭)\n\nI would also use their balm to style. Occasionally i used curlsmith hold me softly and in shower gel, as well as not your mothers curl talk foam to refresh. Id let my hair air dry, sleep with it in a bun (which is why its so frizzy all the time), and rewet it every morning using a bit of the styling products. \n\nLast year, i went to a new hairdresser who recommended new wash to me. I liked what it did to my curls, so i got what she used on me. Unfortunately, she didnt explain that it was a cowash (hairstory doesnt really explain either) and essentially framed it as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner. I was not aware of how cowashes work or how they should be used (i am still confused tbh)\n\nHere i am, a year later, with insane scalp build up and significantly thinner hair (said hair dresser also decided to give me a mullet i did not ask for 🥲). \n\nBefore this, i was putting in a lot of effort into my hair. I used hairtage for shampoo and conditioner, would use not your mothers mousse, the curl smith products i mentioned, and Silk by biosilk. i cant remember if i air dried or diffused in the fourth photo. \n\nFirst photo is most recent using hairology, miss jessie’s leave in and a curl cream, and diffused. Second photo is when i still used just new wash and was after my most recent cut. Third is an average day side profile while still using new wash. Fourth is my routine before new wash. Fifth is what it looked like on an average day. \n\nI think my hair is 2c/3a high porosity(pls confirm or deny) and now it is low density (it used to be so thick 😭). \n\nIm looking for advice and recommendations for shampoo and conditioner. I need to tackle my scalp build up above everything else. \nI also want my curls to stay curled longer. I think i will try using mousse but maybe not gel due to the weight. I think i will get one of those curl shaping brushes as well.\nIve also never found a solution for sleeping with my hair. Every bonnet ive tried has scrunched up my hair or has slipped off at night, but putting it up is causing so much damage. I cant use a satin pillow case for sensory issues. \n\nSuggestions welcome ❤️\n",

My ex, a gym trainer with some Insta following, hyped Nakpro nonstop and said it had the best “absorption.” He also got me whey tubs at heavy heavy discounts. I trusted his “knowledge” and took 1.5 scoops daily.\n\nFrom Jan onwards...I started experiencing heavy bloating, and severe acne outbreak...all over my face...so much that even sleeping turning to one side my whole face used to pain.\n\nNights became sleepless...I became so insecure about my looks, stopped going out with friends and kinda shut myself up in my room, worked, ate, and worried day and night if this outbreak would mark permanent scars on my face or not.\n\nAround May...I couraged up...and went to a dermat, got checked, followed this routine:\n\nGentle facewash along with Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and another Azelaic acid 10% gel in the morning, then Adapalene 0.1% gel and another facewash at night. No maida, no oily snacks, and 3-4 litres of water intake each day.\n\nThings started to get better from Sept...and from this November. I started gymming once again, researched more about protein supplements, found out about Muscleblaze biozyme enzyme got second and third and fourth opinions from many other experienced folks in the gym...and currently only take their isolate version.\n\nPoint is...both the brands were Indian...yet one caused me this horrific incident while the other worked just fine. So do you research well guys and girls...especially girls...cause we have to deal with our massive hormonal imbalances every month. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. Eat clean, sleep well, use products only after critical research take good care of your body and your skin and body will thank you!!\n\nHappy new Year in advanced for anyone who read through!!",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I don’t know what to do to fix this.\n\nMy routine: \n\n•shampoo (garnier fructis) my roots, rinse\n\n• put conditioner in (also garnier) and brush/detangle, rinse \n\n• immediately put a palmful of mousse (cantu) by doing the praying hands (very carefully) and squishing\n\n• la croa curl jelly, about 1/3 of my finger, again by light praying hands and squishing\n\n• plop for a few minutes while i put my clothes on\n\n• diffuse by hovering — first the roots, then the rest of my hair, then pixie diffuse\n\nI’d appreciate any advice!! :’D",

      "content": "So for the last few months to save money, I have been doing just a few foils at my root to make my grow out less drastic (I have been getting partial highlights for years). It usually lifts and looks bright blonde, and looks good. But it started to get brassy and purple shampoo wasn’t helping. \n\nI added a couple more highlights as I have been doing. Then decided to tone the entire head, and this left the new highlights at a perfect honey blonde and the rest of my hair is very ash blonde now - the toner even left a really purple tone. I’m sort of freaking out. \n\nI basically want the ash blonde to not be so bright, and want that to match my new highlights which have more of a golden hue. I also only left the toner in for a third of the time it asked for, so I’m pretty upset it turned out violet/ash white blonde on my hair that I haven’t even bleached at all. It was bleached in the past. \n\nThe picture is not in the best quality but that’s the only mirror in my house. The roots aren’t dark, just an actual blonde and the bottom of my hair is ash. Does anyone have advice on how to get the ash blonde to tone down? \n\nI read that color depositing conditioner may help in a honey blonde, would it also be attainable by mixing a honey blonde dye into conditioner for a low impact color?

I want to get my sister a haircut as a birthday present but if I were to get her one with my stylist where I live, she wouldn't be able to come get it for a couple months. So just if anyone has a recommendation there, I'd appreciate it.\n\nAlso since I need to submit a routine, I'll do my average day one.\n\n* I apply all products, including shampoo and conditioner, with my head upside down.\n* Shampoo with Suave Rosemary &amp; Mint shampoo. I double cleanse. Somtimes I use a hard water shampoo first, but I unfortunately can't remember the brand right now and I'm out of town.\n* Condition with Garnier Whole Blends Honey Treasures conditioner. I apply over my hair, then brush through it with a detangling brush and let it sit for a couple minutes. Then I use \"squish to condish\" before fully rinsing it out. \n* I make sure my hair is soaking wet before applying any styling products. I start with Garnier Whole Blends Honey Water Leave In Cream. I apply all products with \"praying hands\" and then scrunch into my hair.\n* I rewet my hair after the leave in to be soaking wet again.\n* I apply Oudiad Climate Control Strong Hold gel, and LA Looks Sport gel together. I do three applications, making sure I focus one on my roots.\n* I apply the Garnier Whole Blends Honey Treasures Repairing Serum to the ends of my hair.\n* I use Pantene\\* Volume mousse at my roots, then the Curly mousse over the rest of my hair, followed by the volume mousse as well over the rest of my hair. \n* I then apply the Garnier Whole Blends Honey Treasures Heat Protectant.\n* I diffuse my hair, which takes at least an hour lol, and that's a conservative estimate. When my hair is about 70% dry I apply the Herbal Essenses hairspray, which I then diffuse into my hair as I finish.\n* When done diffusing, I use the Garnier Fructis Moroccon Oil to scrunch my hair.\n* I always sleep on a silk pillowcase. I used to use silk scarves or a bonnet but they gave me headaches, which is on me because I'm very prone to them I take medication for it.\n\n\\*I know Pantene is technically not cruelty free, as they sell in China. It's what's available and affordable where I live that works for my hair :/",

I'm 27 and don't spend much time outside, but I do play sports and dance indoors 4-5x per week. \n\nI used to wash my face with a gentle cleanser often and it ended up giving me a rash. Per my doctor, I only use the dove sensitive skin bar soap to wash my face about once a week. I have sjogrens syndrome which among other things causes moderately dry skin, so I use johnson and johnson baby creamy oil lotion every time I get out of the shower on my face and body (i shower approx 4-5x per week). I wear sunscreen on my tattoos and face (and/or more often, a sun hoodie and hat) when I am outside, but I dont wear sunscreen every day because I cant wash my face every day and hate going to sleep with it on! \n\nMore frequent washing, even if I use \"really good\" moisturizers or different cleansers, causes a scaly rash and extreme sensitivity, so i really cant increase or change my cleanser. I don't wear any sort of makeup daily, and I only really wear eye makeup when I have a dance event a couple times a year. I typically remove my makeup with micellar water and coconut oil, but ive been thinking about getting an oil based makeup remover cleanser to use infrequently for this purpose as i think the micellar water is irritating my skin and the straight coconut oil isn't working as well alone. \n\nWhile I am not and have never been acne prone, I feel like my skin has a bit of a texture to it. It also feels thin around my upper cheeks and undereye. I would love to have smoother skin without compromising any of the needs of my skin (primarily, I need to still be able to wash my face extremely infrequently). I am up to trying something at almost any price point! I'm also willing to switch my moisturizer from baby lotion but I do like it haha. \n\nTIA!!",

I do pick my skin (BDD) which I’m trying hard to stop but it’s not so easy.

My hair has multiple wave patterns, 2a, 2b, 2c and I recently tried mousse for the first time.\n\n\\- I shampooed twice (Aveeno Oat Milk Daily Moisture Shampoo)\n\n\\- I put conditioner on wet hair after squeezing some water out (Dove bond strength conditioner)\n\n\\- I brushed my hair in the shower with conditioner in using a wet brush, I noticed a lot more hair came out on the brush than with dry brushing so I wanted to ask should wavy hair be brushed wet? Doesn’t it damage the hair? \n\n\\- I rinsed the conditioner out with coldish water while scrunching\n\n\\- I kept my hair soaking wet and put a small amount of leave in (Garnier Ultra Doux Hair Food Smoothing Coconut and Macademia 3 in 1) and scrunched\n\n\\- Rewet my hair so it was soaking wet\n\n\\- Put mousse in without raking, only glazing the hair (Wella New Wave Curls &amp; Waves Mousse) and scrunched\n\n\\- Scrunched my hair using a microfiber towel then plopped for...tbh I forgot somewhere between 30 minutes to an hour.\n\n\\- Air dried my hair\n\nThe next morning after this whole routine and my hair was fully dry, It just looked how it looked when it was wet but frizzier and tangled, and there was no cast to scrunch out either. The thing is it stayed in the same clumps so it was way too thin looking not like fluffy pretty waves, and just not wearable to me.\n\nSo I had to brush out my hair, and in an attempt to reduce the poof, I put some serum (HASK CURL CARE – 5 in 1 Leave-in Spray) and a touch of pomade (suavetica). It looked ok for about two minutes but then the frizzy poofiness took over again, it’s like my hair immediately absorbed all of the serum instead of letting it sit on top of my hair to stay shiny, maybe I’m not using enough but I’m scared of my hair looking too oily.\n\nAlso I never understood how people don’t dry brush, my hair gets way too tangled overnight to not brush it out, even though I sleep on a silk pillowcase.\n\nPS if anyone wants to recommend products I can’t afford to spend more than like 10 dollars for a single product.\n\nI just feel at a loss doing this whole routine just for me to end up dry brushing my hair then it looks the same as how it does with no product or styling after the shower.",

      "content": "Hello! \n\nIt’s my first time trying to use the curly hair products on my hair. I’m even confused what kind of hair type I have, my guess is 2a but idk 🤷‍♀️ After everything the hair doesn’t look good, it just looks like a bird’s nest and like I haven’t brushed it for a long time, the waves don’t look good. Also, the bottom of my hair is wavier than the top. Could anyone please advise me what went wrong in the routine, what products don’t fit my hair type, maybe are too heavy. I pretended my whole life that my hair is kind of straight, so I have no clue how to go about this. Thank you in advance 🙏 Step by step routine in the shower:\n\n1. Shampooed my hair twice. Didn’t touch the ends, only roots and mids. (Didn’t use a shampoo specifically for curly hair because I don’t have one)\n\n2. Used conditioner on my hair starting from mids to ends. Brushed through my hair and detangled with a wet brush (regular one, not for curly hair) starting from bottom and going up.\n\n3. Washed out the conditioner. Put curl cream (the pink tub from Fenti hair) on my hand and raked it through my hair (used the amount advised by the pinky to thumb method while hugging your hair, idk how to explain it 🤷‍♀️). Brushed through my hair again to distribute the product. Scrunched my hair up with some water\n\n4. Added some Curl Jelly gel by Umberto Giannini on my palms (I have a feeling I didn’t use enough) and raked it through my hair starting from mids to ends, scrunched it up and pulsed 3 times.\n\n5. Went in with the curl styling brush (I watched tutorials on youtube how to use it but I’m not confident that I did it the right way anyway)\n\n6. Started drying my hair by hovering the diffuser over my roots and then moved on to the ends. When I felt the cast harden, started pushing my strands up with the diffuser (confused if I did this part right too). When I pushed the strand up, I held it for like 10 secs in place and let go. Finished drying my hair like this\n\nThe results are as you can see in the picture and I don’t think it looks that good 😭😭 Even considering going back to keeping my hair as is without any product. Please help 🙏 ",

My stylist said my hair is too soft, so I’ve been using a less moisturizing shampoo/conditioner, which had helped with volume and not looking like a wet rat, but now my hair feels so dry and my curls STILL are falling by the end of day one. They look great from morning to about 4pm, and then they start falling limp. I’ve been doing a deep dive into everything hair related and I’m stumped on where to go. \n\nI have fine, low-density 2b-3a curls, I think low porosity. For my current routine, I’m using Love, Beauty, Planet 5-1 Mulibenefit shampoo (double shampoo) and same line conditioner, then 1.5 quarter size amount of Curlsmith HydroStyle FlexiHold Gel while soaking wet upside down, plop for 5 mins max, then diffuse until 80-90% dry. \n\nI’m wondering if a different gel would reduce the dry feeling, or if I need to go back to moisturizing more somehow? My hair is so finicky, and my stylist hasn’t responded to my messages since I got my cut. Truly any advice is so so welcome right now.",
