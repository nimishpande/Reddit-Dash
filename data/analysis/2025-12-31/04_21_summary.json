      "content": "To start off on routine, i have been using New Wash by hairstory as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner for about a year now. (I hadnt used shampoo and conditioner for a YEAR 😭)\n\nI would also use their balm to style. Occasionally i used curlsmith hold me softly and in shower gel, as well as not your mothers curl talk foam to refresh. Id let my hair air dry, sleep with it in a bun (which is why its so frizzy all the time), and rewet it every morning using a bit of the styling products. \n\nLast year, i went to a new hairdresser who recommended new wash to me. I liked what it did to my curls, so i got what she used on me. Unfortunately, she didnt explain that it was a cowash (hairstory doesnt really explain either) and essentially framed it as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner. I was not aware of how cowashes work or how they should be used (i am still confused tbh)\n\nHere i am, a year later, with insane scalp build up and significantly thinner hair (said hair dresser also decided to give me a mullet i did not ask for 🥲). \n\nBefore this, i was putting in a lot of effort into my hair. I used hairtage for shampoo and conditioner, would use not your mothers mousse, the curl smith products i mentioned, and Silk by biosilk. i cant remember if i air dried or diffused in the fourth photo. \n\nFirst photo is most recent using hairology, miss jessie’s leave in and a curl cream, and diffused. Second photo is when i still used just new wash and was after my most recent cut. Third is an average day side profile while still using new wash. Fourth is my routine before new wash. Fifth is what it looked like on an average day. \n\nI think my hair is 2c/3a high porosity(pls confirm or deny) and now it is low density (it used to be so thick 😭). \n\nIm looking for advice and recommendations for shampoo and conditioner. I need to tackle my scalp build up above everything else. \nI also want my curls to stay curled longer. I think i will try using mousse but maybe not gel due to the weight. I think i will get one of those curl shaping brushes as well.\nIve also never found a solution for sleeping with my hair. Every bonnet ive tried has scrunched up my hair or has slipped off at night, but putting it up is causing so much damage. I cant use a satin pillow case for sensory issues. \n\nSuggestions welcome ❤️\n",

Anyone who's experienced this knows how frustrating it can be and I'm wondering ifanyone has any tips for how to prevent this from happening again.\n\nBoth of these times I went to very highly rewied salons that were $80-100 per cut. With both stylists I showed them a picture of myself when I liked my hair best from 2 years ago. It's a cut with a steep A line where the front reaches my collar bone (this part of my hair is wavy/spirals) and the back is at the bottom of my neck. I make sure to clarify that my hair lifts and spirals the shorter is gets and that to get this style some volume was taken off with thinning scissors. \n\nThe first time this happened, it was the same person who gave me fantastic cuts in the past and when I asked her to recreate it, this happened. This time I even emphasized \"I want to make sure it's not too short because this happened to me before.\" But here I am again. \n\nAm I doing something that's confusing them? Is it too much to expect them to take responsibility for making sure they know how to achieve the picture I'm showing them (of me, not some model with a different face and different hair). How can I make sure this doesnt happens next time? ",

      "content": "I've had curly hair my whole life but never knew how to take care of it very well. I'm in my 50's now and really trying to embrace it for the last 2 years but it's driving me crazy. It looks ridiculous.\n\nMy hair was down to my bra line, all one length. I recently had a 'curly haircut' and consultation and now it's just above my shoulder. I don't know porosity or curl type as the stylist said 'she doesn't believe in that' when I asked. It doesn't seem like it was layered, because my 'bangs' are down past my chin, same length as the rest of my hair. My hair is soft black/very dark brown with grey all around my face.(zero dye/chemicals). She didn't give much advice other than telling me to only put product in with dripping wet hair and to only use the diffuser after drying my hair to about 80% dry. She did not tell me what products would be good for my hair or anything.\n\nWhen my hair is very short it's extremely tight curly. As it gets longer, the crown and sides begins to get wavy, slightly curly but the underneath and back of my hair stays in coils and ringlets. I've tried finger curling the top/sides and it mostly works but it ends up clumping into ringlets also. I try separate the curls, but they just clump right back or frizz out. And if I don't finger curl the entire top and sides of my hair, it just looks messy and frizzy with ringlets sticking out of the bottom and back. And it just takes so long to do all that.\n\nI have a really rough, basic routine. I wash my hair 2x a week. I use Head and Shoulders 1x a week followed with Aussi miracle curl conditioner. The other time I use the Aussi shampoo w/ the conditioner.\n\nI always put a leave in conditioner (Aussi - I'm sure you see a theme here).\n\nIf I use product it's Cake foam to gel or the curl cream. I'll sometimes spice things up a bit and use some watered down gel while scrunching. I have a curl bounce brush, a denman brush and an UNbrush detangler along with a wide tooth comb. I do actually use the bounce or denman to try to separate things out. I use a t-shirt for excess moisture before air drying or diffusing.\n\nI just want a more uniform curl all over instead of slightly wavy to semi curly frizz on top with coils and ringlets in the back and bottom without having to spend an hour + finger curling the entire top half of my head. If I have to change shampoo/conditioners, product whatever, I am up for it. I just absolutely hate the way it looks right now and I'm close to giving up. Any advice or tips would be most appreciated.",

The day after I wash my hair, my curls will turn into a frizzy mess.\n\nHere's my routine:\n\n\\-Wash &amp; Condition every 3-4 days with Curl Chemistry Shampoo &amp; then the Deep Moisturizing Conditioner. (both sulphate free)\n\n\\-Brush out in shower with a curl brush (similar to a Bouncecurl brush)\n\n\\-Apply Curl Chemistry Curl Activator leave in conditioner (I apply this with my fingers to not brush my hair out too much).

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is a request for advice and a bit of venting of the journey at the same time, might be helpful to someone in the future :)\n\nI'm 32M and I've always had pimples since puberty. These always came as pustules, papules and (rarely) cysts. A normal day for me is to have 3-5 at a time, but they can be quite pronounced so from what I see online it checks out as mild-to-moderate acne. I was prescribed isotretinoin when I was 28 but I decided not to take it because of the side effects. Having pimples really messed with my confidence but I would rather power through and try other methods than get these very scary symptoms everyone talks about.\n\nHowever, this year I broke up with my boyfriend at the end of my PhD so I was under a lot of stress and got a huge flare with 20+ active pimples at once. My GP put me on topical clindamycin and adapalene and it went a bit down but not fully. Once I stopped with clindamycin I got a new flare, after which clindamycin no longer worked. I was on doxycicline for a month, which cleared everything, but as soon as I stopped it came back with a new huge flare of 20+ pimples. I was then referred to a derm, who said it was probably best to go on isotretinoin, but put me on minocyclin for 3 months because it was summer and they didn't want me to start isotretinoin during the heat season. After minocycline the acne started to come back so now I started with 30 mg/day isotretinoin (3x10 mg/day). I'm 71kg btw, checks out as 0.42 mg/kg/day. This is the lower end of what is prescribed but she did mention that if in a month my lab work is fine that she might up the dose a bit. I'm now on day 4 and I dove into A LOT of youtube videos and subreddits about this but I can basically only find testimonies from women/afab, or for either severe acne or high doses. So if someone is in the same situation as me, I'd love to chat. My question is, do you have any hacks/tips to deal with the symptoms that might arise? I'm particularly interested in strategies to combat the mood swings and depression, but also the pain in the joints as I am a climber and I'd like to continue doing it often but safely.\n\nJust in case somebody wonders, my skincare routine (before and now) is very simple. I wash my face in the morning/night with Bioderma's Sébium Gel Moussant Nettoyant Purifiant, then I use Paula's Choice Clear Moisturizer SPF30 during the day and Paula's Choice Clear Resist Anti-Aging Moisturizer at night, and I use vaseline for the lips.\n\nThanks a lot for those who made it this far!\n\nTLDR: Useful tips/hacks for isotretinoin course :)",

      "content": "21M with oily, acne-prone skin.\n\nMy skincare journey started around August 2023. I began using only **Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Cleanser** and **Pilgrim Vitamin C serum**. I did **not** use any moisturizer or sunscreen at that time.\n\nAfter the Vitamin C finished, I switched to **Minimalist Niacinamide serum**, but I noticed my skin actually got worse. Over time, I kept starting and stopping skincare randomly. For almost 2 years, I was basically just using the salicylic acid cleanser without proper moisturizing or sun protection.\n\nAfter researching, I now realize that skipping **moisturizer and sunscreen** probably damaged my skin barrier.\n\nI stopped all skincare for 1–2 months and recently restarted. I don’t plan to visit a dermatologist due to bad past experiences and lack of good dermatologists in my city.\n\n# Current Routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Deconstruct Gel Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Minimalist Vitamin K + Retinal Under Eye Cream (for dark circles)\n\nFrom my research, a **simple 3-step routine** seems best:\n\n* AM: Cleanser + Moisturizer + Sunscreen\n* PM: Cleanser + Moisturizer (+ retinol later)\n\nI’m thinking of **changing my moisturizer**, since I’m currently using a body lotion on my face.\n\nI’m not in a rush at all — even if it takes **1–2 years**, I just want my skin to heal properly.\n\n**Looking for suggestions on:**\n\n* Whether my current routine makes sense\n* If I should stop or limit salicylic acid\n* Moisturizer recommendations for oily, acne-prone skin\n* When (or if) I should introduce retinol\n\nAny help would be really appreciated 🙏",

I have naturally frizzy hair too so I don’t know how that plays into it. Whenever I go out in the heat it almost immediately frizzes up somehow even if I style it smooth with a blow dryer.
