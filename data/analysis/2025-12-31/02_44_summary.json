      "content": "To start off on routine, i have been using New Wash by hairstory as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner for about a year now. (I hadnt used shampoo and conditioner for a YEAR 😭)\n\nI would also use their balm to style. Occasionally i used curlsmith hold me softly and in shower gel, as well as not your mothers curl talk foam to refresh. Id let my hair air dry, sleep with it in a bun (which is why its so frizzy all the time), and rewet it every morning using a bit of the styling products. \n\nLast year, i went to a new hairdresser who recommended new wash to me. I liked what it did to my curls, so i got what she used on me. Unfortunately, she didnt explain that it was a cowash (hairstory doesnt really explain either) and essentially framed it as a replacement for shampoo and conditioner. I was not aware of how cowashes work or how they should be used (i am still confused tbh)\n\nHere i am, a year later, with insane scalp build up and significantly thinner hair (said hair dresser also decided to give me a mullet i did not ask for 🥲). \n\nBefore this, i was putting in a lot of effort into my hair. I used hairtage for shampoo and conditioner, would use not your mothers mousse, the curl smith products i mentioned, and Silk by biosilk. i cant remember if i air dried or diffused in the fourth photo. \n\nFirst photo is most recent using hairology, miss jessie’s leave in and a curl cream, and diffused. Second photo is when i still used just new wash and was after my most recent cut. Third is an average day side profile while still using new wash. Fourth is my routine before new wash. Fifth is what it looked like on an average day. \n\nI think my hair is 2c/3a high porosity(pls confirm or deny) and now it is low density (it used to be so thick 😭). \n\nIm looking for advice and recommendations for shampoo and conditioner. I need to tackle my scalp build up above everything else. \nI also want my curls to stay curled longer. I think i will try using mousse but maybe not gel due to the weight. I think i will get one of those curl shaping brushes as well.\nIve also never found a solution for sleeping with my hair. Every bonnet ive tried has scrunched up my hair or has slipped off at night, but putting it up is causing so much damage. I cant use a satin pillow case for sensory issues. \n\nSuggestions welcome ❤️\n",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

Other times I will skip that and just stick to hydration because I know it’s also dehydrated. I’ve had these bumps for months now though and they’re taking forever to go away.

The day after I wash my hair, my curls will turn into a frizzy mess.\n\nHere's my routine:\n\n\\-Wash &amp; Condition every 3-4 days with Curl Chemistry Shampoo &amp; then the Deep Moisturizing Conditioner. (both sulphate free)\n\n\\-Brush out in shower with a curl brush (similar to a Bouncecurl brush)\n\n\\-Apply Curl Chemistry Curl Activator leave in conditioner (I apply this with my fingers to not brush my hair out too much).

I have naturally frizzy hair too so I don’t know how that plays into it. Whenever I go out in the heat it almost immediately frizzes up somehow even if I style it smooth with a blow dryer. Also, I use a silk pillow case. I usually pull it up in a loose bun (if it’s not wet) to sleep at night with a scrunchie.Thank you and happy new year everyone 😌🫶🏼\n\nMy Hair Routine:\n\nProducts I use every other day or every 2 days on my hair:\n\n-Native shampoo and conditioner \n-Once a week “It’s a 10” leave in conditioner \n\nProducts used to try and style it wavy before:\n\n-OGX Curl cream\n-Curl mousse (can’t remember brand) \n-Diffuser attachment on wavy talk hair dryer ",

      "title": "[Acne] 32M on isotretinoin. Advice?",
      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is a request for advice and a bit of venting of the journey at the same time, might be helpful to someone in the future :)\n\nI'm 32M and I've always had pimples since puberty. These always came as pustules, papules and (rarely) cysts. A normal day for me is to have 3-5 at a time, but they can be quite pronounced so from what I see online it checks out as mild-to-moderate acne. I was prescribed isotretinoin when I was 28 but I decided not to take it because of the side effects. Having pimples really messed with my confidence but I would rather power through and try other methods than get these very scary symptoms everyone talks about.\n\nHowever, this year I broke up with my boyfriend at the end of my PhD so I was under a lot of stress and got a huge flare with 20+ active pimples at once. My GP put me on topical clindamycin and adapalene and it went a bit down but not fully. Once I stopped with clindamycin I got a new flare, after which clindamycin no longer worked. I was on doxycicline for a month, which cleared everything, but as soon as I stopped it came back with a new huge flare of 20+ pimples. I was then referred to a derm, who said it was probably best to go on isotretinoin, but put me on minocyclin for 3 months because it was summer and they didn't want me to start isotretinoin during the heat season. After minocycline the acne started to come back so now I started with 30 mg/day isotretinoin (3x10 mg/day). I'm 71kg btw, checks out as 0.42 mg/kg/day. This is the lower end of what is prescribed but she did mention that if in a month my lab work is fine that she might up the dose a bit. I'm now on day 4 and I dove into A LOT of youtube videos and subreddits about this but I can basically only find testimonies from women/afab, or for either severe acne or high doses. So if someone is in the same situation as me, I'd love to chat. My question is, do you have any hacks/tips to deal with the symptoms that might arise? I'm particularly interested in strategies to combat the mood swings and depression, but also the pain in the joints as I am a climber and I'd like to continue doing it often but safely.\n\nJust in case somebody wonders, my skincare routine (before and now) is very simple. I wash my face in the morning/night with Bioderma's Sébium Gel Moussant Nettoyant Purifiant, then I use Paula's Choice Clear Moisturizer SPF30 during the day and Paula's Choice Clear Resist Anti-Aging Moisturizer at night, and I use vaseline for the lips.\n\nThanks a lot for those who made it this far!\n\nTLDR: Useful tips/hacks for isotretinoin course :)",

      "content": "21M with oily, acne-prone skin.\n\nMy skincare journey started around August 2023. I began using only **Minimalist 2% Salicylic Acid Cleanser** and **Pilgrim Vitamin C serum**. I did **not** use any moisturizer or sunscreen at that time.\n\nAfter the Vitamin C finished, I switched to **Minimalist Niacinamide serum**, but I noticed my skin actually got worse. Over time, I kept starting and stopping skincare randomly. For almost 2 years, I was basically just using the salicylic acid cleanser without proper moisturizing or sun protection.\n\nAfter researching, I now realize that skipping **moisturizer and sunscreen** probably damaged my skin barrier.\n\nI stopped all skincare for 1–2 months and recently restarted. I don’t plan to visit a dermatologist due to bad past experiences and lack of good dermatologists in my city.\n\n# Current Routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Deconstruct Gel Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n* Minimalist Salicylic Acid Cleanser\n* JOY Almond &amp; Honey Body Lotion (on face)\n* Minimalist Vitamin K + Retinal Under Eye Cream (for dark circles)\n\nFrom my research, a **simple 3-step routine** seems best:\n\n* AM: Cleanser + Moisturizer + Sunscreen\n* PM: Cleanser + Moisturizer (+ retinol later)\n\nI’m thinking of **changing my moisturizer**, since I’m currently using a body lotion on my face.\n\nI’m not in a rush at all — even if it takes **1–2 years**, I just want my skin to heal properly.\n\n**Looking for suggestions on:**\n\n* Whether my current routine makes sense\n* If I should stop or limit salicylic acid\n* Moisturizer recommendations for oily, acne-prone skin\n* When (or if) I should introduce retinol\n\nAny help would be really appreciated 🙏",
