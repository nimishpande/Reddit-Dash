      "content": "Hey! So I have no idea what type of hair I even have. I’m thinking it’s 2b though it’s hard for me to tell. I rarely try to enhance my natural hair as seen here because it takes a lot of work and the frizz is very overstimulating. I usually just keep it up or twist/braid after washing to avoid having to deal with it. \n\nI’d describe it as fine (it’s deceivingly voluminous) but also wavy / curly ish?? It also is clearly very dry. \n\nIn this picture, today, I washed it and then put in leave in conditioner on the mids and ends + put lightweight anti frizz oil while doing some random finger coiling to try to maintain a consistent pattern. I also diffused it flipping as the roots get weighed down a lot I find. It helped but it still is frizzy and crazy and I wonder what I can do differently to help it be better. \n\nWhen it’s soaking wet it’s straight, when it’s damp it begins to wavy/spiral without me even touching it but it looks better when I enhance them with the finger coiling as my pattern is very sporadic and random if not! And ofc when it’s dry, it gets frizzy. \n\nI’m open to any routine ideas, product recommendations, styling techniques and if you can identify my type of hair etc etc. \n\nThank you!! ",

      "content": "I'm till kind of in shock, so bear with me. I'm in my early 30s and I literally just found out a little over a month ago that I have curly hair.\nFor context: I've been blow-drying my hair straight twice a day (morning and night) since before junior high. Just brushing it straight down when wet and blow-drying it flat. I rarely flat ironed, but the constant blow-drying was doing the job of keeping my hair straight. I genuinely had NO idea I had any curl pattern.\n\nThe Discovery:\nAbout 5 weeks ago, I decided to do a \"curl test\" just out of curiosity after a conversation with friends, and waves started forming. I was honestly confused. Fast forward to now and I'm apparently 2C/3A? Wild.\n\nMy Current Routine:\n\nBriogeo Curl Charisma shampoo\nDivaCurl conditioner\nBriogeo Don't Despair Repair protein treatment (1x/week in place of conditioner)\nPattern styling cream (quarter size at night, dime size for morning refresh)\nCurlsmith heat protectant when diffusing\nI only brush right before the shower with a mixed bristle brush (per my stylist's recommendation)\nFinger detangle in the shower\nT-shirt/microfiber towel to scrunch out water (no rubbing)\nPrayer hands + finger waving + scrunching with product\nDiffuse upside down: medium heat/low speed, then switch to low heat/low speed when nearly dry\nSleep in silk bonnet on silk pillowcase\nMorning refresh: spritz with water until dampish, small amount of Pattern cream, scrunch\n\nI shampoo and condition every other night, but I get my hair wet every night to refresh.\n\nThe Journey So Far:\nWeek 1-2: Barely any curl definition, looked stringy and weird wet, questioning if this was real\nWeek 3: Had a full crisis. Almost gave up and went back to straight hair. The greasiness, the unevenness, the awkward in-between phase - I was DONE.\nWeek 4: Got my first curly cut from my stylist (who was SO excited). She gave me layers and removed weight without touching my length. Game changer.\nWeek 5 (now): The photos you're seeing are from morning refreshes, not even full wash days. I'm honestly still processing that this is my hair.\nThings I've Learned:\n\nThe \"healing timeline\" people talk about is REAL. My existing heat-damaged hair has legitimately improved in curl definition over these 5 weeks.\nYour hair can look completely different in just a month\nWeek 3 almost broke me, but I'm so glad I pushed through\nThe underlayers of my hair are curlier than the top layers (which apparently means the top was getting more heat damage and needs more time to recover)\nFinding a stylist who understands curly hair is everything\n\nThe first photo is my hair when I still wore it straight (many months ago). The e next pic is early curl from week 1. The oast photos are from the last couple days - just morning refreshes, not full wash days.\nMy family thinks I'm crazy and wants me to go back to straight hair, but my girlfriend and all my curly-haired friends have been incredibly supportive. My stylist literally went buck wild when I walked in with curls for the first time (never told her ahead of time).\nIf you're in week 2 or 3 and thinking about quitting - PLEASE don't. I almost did. And now look.\nHappy to answer any questions!",

      "content": "[PART 2] of comparing Indian version of skincare products with its foreign counterparts. \n\nToday I tried to compare Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra Indian variant with its USA counterpart. \n\nFrom the first screenshot we can conclude that the USA variant is silicone free and has \"more,\" exactly 5, ingredients which creates \"hydration\" for the skin and has 2 \"less\" ingredients which may cause \"oily skin\".\n\nNow from the second screenshot, the major differences are:\n\nThe Texture:\n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses Silicones (Cyclopentasiloxane and Cyclohexasiloxane). These give the cream a silky, smooth feel that disappears quickly into the skin. It feels more like a velvety finish. \n \nThe Right Side (USA): They swaps these silicones for Natural Plant Oils (Brassica Campestris Seed Oil and Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil). This makes it feel much richer and greasier. It doesn't evaporate quickly, it stays on the surface longer to physically nourish the skin. Which may make it bad for our Indian skin, due to humid climate. \n\nThe Seal: \n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid. These are fatty acids that create a thick, physical seal on top of your skin. It’s designed to waterproof your skin so moisture can't escape.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and Sodium Citrate. Instead of just sealing the surface, it focuses on soothing irritation and providing antioxidant protection.\n\nThe Emulsifiers:\n\nThe Left Side (Indian): Uses more traditional, synthetic emulsifiers (PEG-100 Stearate, Steareth-21). These are very stable and give the product a long shelf life and consistent texture.\n\nThe Right Side (USA): Uses Cetearyl Glucoside, It is generally considered more skin-friendly for people with extremely sensitive or eczema-prone skin because it mimics the skin's natural structure.\n\nThis concludes this comparison between two variants of Bioderma Atoderm Creme Ultra between two different regions. \n\nTo my research a few people claiming that we, here in India, get inferior products as compared to the foreign counterparts, I think it's not inferior at all, it's just made/formulate in such a way that it supports our skins that too in a very humid climate, just like we have here in India as compared to cold weather in any western country!!!\n\nLet me know what you guys think. \n\nP.S. I'm not a dermat, so I cannot fully differentiate between the ingredients list all by myself, so I used Google and Gemini to help me sort things out. If there's any mistake I'd love know in the comments section! ",

      "content": "Hi, I hope this is the right place to ask for help on this. I have combination, sensitive, and acne prone skin ( oily nose+cheeks+forehead, dry everywhere else ). I also shave my face every \\~2/3days or so with a single blade safety razor, which is def a factor for my facial irritation sometimes, but this feels different than that. \n\nI’m not sure if the products I’m using are clashing or what, but my skin has been super dry+breaking out much more than usual. \n\nCurrently I’m using the naturium niacinamide cleansing gelee 3% face wash, which I previously used before and my skin loved it. I alternate between lush’s tea tree water toner ( which I’ve used forever, skin loves it ) and paula’s choice 2% BHA liquid exfoliant ( which I’ve used for a while and it usually causes me to breakout a bit before clearing up REALLY good ) and glossiers after baume as my moisturizer. It seems like this combination is causing my skin to breakout and become red &amp; irritated ( shown in the photos ). \n\nI assume the face wash is clashing with something else, since before I re-bought it recently, I’ve been using the good molecules hydrating facial cleansing gel with the same routine mentioned above, and I didn’t experience the redness/breakouts/irritation. \n\nAny advice? I switched from the good molecules face wash to the naturium since the GM didn’t seem to do much for my skin. It was okay, but the naturium wash always left my skin feeling better. Are there certain ingredients I shouldn’t be using together? I’m not the best with the science behind skincare, I just want something simple that’ll clear up my skin and not irritate it lol. \n\nIgnore how bad these pictures are, I’m trying to not shave until my skin calms down and a phillips oneblade only cuts so close haha. \n\nAny and all advice is much appreciated 🙏 ",

      "content": "So I’m pretty new to all this. I realized around a year ago that my hair has real potential to be curly and I’m looking for advice to really make them pop.\n\nToday’s routine was as follows:\n\n\\- shampoo - probably garnier or Pantene, not really sure which one. I’m out of conditioner, so didn’t have any of that in my routine today. \n\n\\- once out of the shower, I squeezed the water out and let the mane sit in a towel \n\n\\- I wet my hair with the spray bottle, then used Lush‘s Curl Power  curl cream all over, and then Not Your Mother‘s gel. Then I did some scrunching and some twisting. \n\n\\- then I diffused. First on medium, then on high. At some point I scrunched in some Wella mousse. I stopped once it was about 90% dry and then just let the air do the rest because my patience ran out by then and I started to feel deaf.\n\nI never feel like routines do much but like in the photos above, some of those curls begin to pop. I think pic 1 captures it the best, the ones in  pic 2 and 3 are actually a lot juicier than they seem here. As for the rest of the mane, well you can look at pic 3.  \n\nWould love some adviceeee ! Now here are some things you should know:\n\n\\- I think I need products that really don’t weight down my curls. \n\n\\- I don’t know if it’s my products or my hair in general, but when I get through the curl routine everything just feels extremely dry. Using shampoo, conditioner, and some serum before a quick blowdry with Dyson at least ends up looking so much better (and feels okay to the touch). \n\n\\- I also have the Miss Jessie’s Pillow Talk cream and Jelly Curl gel and I use it with the Wella mousse. My hair is def dry af after that. The Wella mousse, while drying, seem to be the only thing that gets curls in place while I wet style it. Everything else I use.. well it just feels like it’s all in there, not doing much. \n\n\\- I have the Giovani eco chic technology clarifying shampoo too. I use it sometimes but it  feels risky using it while my hair feel so dry after a routine like this.\n\n\\- I’m a bit skeptical about having too many products, so please dont suggest please 10 new products!\n\n\\- I think curl creams are a scam (there, I said it!). Not against using one but honestly it just feels like a conditioner with a slightly different consistency. Ideally I’d just like a reaaaallllyy good conditioner to moisturise my hair,  something I maybe wouldn’t fully rinse it out in the shower. ",

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",
