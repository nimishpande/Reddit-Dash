      "content": "I have heard that blowdrying your hair can cause heat damage, and that products to prevent heat damage can cause build-up on the hair that can weigh it down and make it seem limp and heavy. I've ALSO heard that air-drying your hair, especially if it takes an hour+ to dry, can lead to  unhealthy scalp via fungus/bacteria/yeast. This claim doesn't make sense to me because, where did those things come from on a healthy scalp? Hair scientists, what is the actual deal about how we should dry our hair?",

SO stoked.\n\nRoutine this time: \n\n1. Wash Ouidad Anti-frizz shampo quick to get most of my products out, then InnerSense scalp detox, BounceCurl gentle clarifying shampoo (been a bit and Ouidad shampoo usually does a good job with getting rid of build-up).\n2. InnerSense Conditioner (although NYM conditioner worked and felt quite similar in post about my recent hotel water fiasco) - detangle brush, then while still in shower: \n3. Rake in: dollop of AG Beach Bomb Cream\n4. Rake in:  *NEW* dollop Briogeo Curl Charisma cream\n5. Rake in: *NEW* dollop Briogeo Curl Charisma gel - detangle brush to distribute everything evenly throughout hair, then scrunch every direction raking hair off scalp, rewettingas needed to get clumps to reform &amp; wet-plop in shower cap - finish shower. Then out of shower, the following...\n6. BounceCurl EdgeLift brush - section top &amp; crown, and leave sides &amp; back dangling and do those first\n7. *NEW* NotYourMother's Beach Babe foam, glaze and scrunch, concentrated on roots area, but also lengths each section \n8. Biosilk Rock Hard gelee, emulsify in wet hands and glaze on quarter-size dollop per section, then scrunch until hands feel \"clean\" of product. I put a little emulsified NYM Flash Freeze gel (5) just on the ends that tend to straighten.\n9. Microplop, enough to dry fairly fast\n10. Diffuse cupping just the ends, just a little to set cast on the ends but not put weird bends, just until cast starts to harden.\n11. Hover diffuse - to 100% dry\n[Ali Noskowiak diffuse routine. ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cz347PyO6LC/?igsh=MWoweWVuZWw1b2NoYw==) To speed up drying after cast is well set, I use the cone on my roots, upside-down, holding casts with my arm to keep them from blowing around until scalp fully dry, then continue to cup and/or hover till fully dry.\n12. 3 drops Righteous Roots hair oil warmed in palms, gather hair on top of head and gently squeeze to ends. Fluff roots. Scrunch any cast around face by smoothing lengths roots to ends with tips of my fingers carefully. \n\nBedtime: Use coily tie to put my hair at my forehead and silk bonnet to sleep. Just water with a couple pumps (to a full bottle of water) of Ouidad Curl Shaper Memory Maker Revitalizing Milk to refresh this morning. ",

I’ve really been wanting to experiment with different hairstyles and routines and would like some advice.\n\nI’ve always had really short and straight hair but my hair got super curly when I hit puberty. Since then, I’ve sort of just rocked messy curly hair with minimal styling and upkeep but I’ve also lately been finger coiling my hair for track meets. At its longest, the back of my hair is around 11 inches, but the length does vary just based on the haircut I got about 6-7 months ago. I was thinking of getting a front taper and using a headband to push my curls back, but what do yall think?\n\nRoutine:\n\n\\- Detangle, Shampoo and Condition with Being Shampoo and Conditioner once a week (I will not get hair wet if I have finger coils in for about 5 days; I’ll only use curl activator)\n\n\\- Condition about every 3 days\n\n\\- If I’m about to do finger coils, I’ll use Being Leave in, She’s Moisturizing Curl Smoothie and Eco gel after doing my wash routine\n\n\\- Bonnet when I sleep",

Are sugary-sweet food-like fragrances (whether in perfumes, body sprays, deodorants, body washes or skincare) \"in\" right now?**\n\nIn my noble battle against time, gravity and genetics, I've become a certified gym bunny... in there 5 days a wk, rain or shine, geriatric aches or not. But, my schedule shifted recently and I've started going in at times I didn't before... times that seem to be especially popular with younger crowds. And, I kid you not, I legit thought that the management had started to install air fresheners that had sugary sweet food-like scents all over the gym. I was smelling sugar cookies, strawberry shortcake, cookies &amp; cream etc. Which... let me tell you... not the most helpful thing when you're on your fitness journey. But, then, I started to realize that these were actually fragrances on the younger women working out around me.\n\nI don't think it's just a regional thing. I live in Florida, but was just in California for six weeks and visited multiple gyms across SoCal and picked up on the same thing there.\n\nThis isn't a value judgement. The scent profile is definitely not for me... but many things these days aren't for me, that's fine. I don't recall this being a thing 20 years ago when I was closer to these ladies ages. So.. is this... a thing?",

      "content": "Hello! I could use a bit of advice on my plans for taking better care of my skin.\n\nFor context: I have oily, acne-prone, sensitive skin, had a bad reaction to one of those anti-acne kits in my teens so foolishly neglected things for awhile. Started seeing a dermatologist a few years back, got diagnosed with hormonal acne, and I've since had a couple of long courses of isotretinoin tablets - hugely successful, almost completely cleared up the acne on my cheeks/nose area and barely had any breakouts during treatment, but acne would eventually return on my chin/lips area a few months after stopping the treatments. \n\nCurrently trying WinLevi twice daily, been on it for a couple months, skin handles it fine, but I'm still getting a weekly cycle of regular whiteheads/pustules. The most annoying part is they are almost exclusively around the lower corners of my lips, usually on one side, but it just feels like those areas are never allowed to fully heal.\n\nI've been doing some research and, combined with a few lifestyle changes, thought about trying a proper routine to take better care of my skin in general, with a focus on addressing the hormonal acne I'm still getting and repairing the damage. I'll take it slow, one product a month, and see how we go. A friend uses a mix of western products for actives &amp; Korean products for barrier support, so she gave me a general idea of what to look for.\n\nI came up with a list of products I liked the look of and could use some input on, I'd be super grateful for some advice on sorting out which ones would be core for my needs vs. nice optionals, or unnecessary, as well as what my routine should look like. I have a rough idea, but it can be a bit daunting when you first start looking at all these unfamiliar new products, and wanting to get the order right for introducing then layering them properly! For example, I was unsure what was OK to introduce alongside the Winlevi vs. what would be replacing it, i.e. WL in the morning, then azelaic acid or a retinoid in the evening in place of the WL. Also wasn't sure if I should be double cleansing. \n\nIf anyone has any better alternatives or suggestions, that'd be appreciated as well. Very new to all this, so any advice at all would go a long way.\n\nThanks for taking the time!\n\nCurrent routine: \n\nCeraVe Foaming Cleanser &gt; Winlevi &gt; QV Face Moisturising Day Cream SPF30\n\nDaily products I'm interested in:\n\n* Dr. Althea 345 Relief Cream\n* QV Ceramides Cleanser \n* The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion\n* Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Toner\n* Anua 7 Rice Ceramide Barrier Serum\n* Beauty of Joseon Glow Serum (Propolis + Niacinamide)\n* The Ordinary Azelaic Acid 10% Suspension\n* COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Essence\n* Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water\n\nWeekly rotation: \n\n* Benton PHA Peeling Gel\n* Beauty of Joseon Centella Calming Mask",

I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",
