For years now I’ve seen posts of all you curly haired gods and goddesses simply wrapping your curls at night and waking up as though you’ve just spent 2 hours doing your hair. I just don’t get it! To me the idea of my curls lasting more than a day is an utter mystery.\n\nI’ve tried it all. Ive used a bonnet, clips, a wrap, cast with gel before bed, and more and yet every time i wake up my hair looks like the 2nd picture. How in the world do people do it? Am I doomed to have to spend several hours in the bathroom every morning to not hate the way I look?\n\nRoutine: I use argan oil of Morocco shampoo once a week, shea moisture curl and shine conditioner, shea moisture mouse, a heat protectant and detangler from Amika, a diffuser, and rosemary oil.\n\nEDIT: More routine info for mods. The products are applied in that order and scrunched in in sections. I dry with the diffuser and separate curls with oiled fingers.",

I’ve always felt unsure about my hairstyle, especially because I think my nose is on the bigger side and I worry my curls make my features stand out more instead of balancing my face. My photos I posted go from last night (first 3) to this morning before water (4-6) to after water at 7-8\n\nI’d really appreciate honest advice on how to better define my curls\n\nReducing frizz\n\nWhether a different cut would suit my face better\n\nHow to maintain volume without it puffing out\n\nCurrent routine:\n\nShampoo: Not Your Mother’s Curl Defining Shampoo\n\nConditioner: (none currently)\n\nStyling: I’ve only tried using water in the morning to restyle\n\nDrying: I let it air dry\n\nhair protection: none \n\nmy routine\n\njust water in the morning\n\nRight after washing it looks decent, but by morning it pushes outward and gets frizzy. When I try to restyle with water, it just expands more instead of defining.\n\nI’ve never really had a structured routine before, so I’m open to product suggestions, technique advice, haircut recommendations, or anything else that could help.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I live in germany and my doctor put me on 20% azelaic acid bc she said i have a light form of rosacea. But to me they dont behave like rosacea flushes, i do get light flushes sometimes but it doesnt affect the actual red spots. Is it just red pimple marks? I never had problems with severe acne, just normal breakouts.\n\nAt night i only use the azelaic acid atm and in the morning i use a glycerin serum with a spf. Sometimes i used nianciamide but right now i kinda want a clean slate and let my skin react to the azelaic.\n\nWhat do you guys recommend? Microneedling should be the last option bc i do not have the money atm to try every single thing in the world :(",

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Even though it messed with me mentally my skin was perfect for months after up until about january when I went back to school after being on break. This is when I started eating worse and eating more sugary things which i’m now trying to sugar cleanse to see if itll help. However i’ve noticed my acne worsens each day and don’t know what to do. I feel like only pills help me. My AM routine consists of Gentle cleanse, Niacinimide, Clindamycin, Moisturizer and a sunscreen. My PM is Gentle cleanse, Moisturizer, Tret 0.05% and Moisturizer again. I was on 0.025% and had no clindamycin until 2 days ago my derm put me on it so i’m hoping it helps. Does anyone have any advice? I even got new silk pillow cases and swap them every 2 days. I feel like i’m stuck and it’s very draining. I just wanna find a good routine with an occasional breakout, not months of this. I don’t get those deep cystic acne anymore because i was on accutane, I just get normal acne all around my cheeks.

      "content": "Generally we are taught that (apart from needing a normal amount of hydration present in skin and hair, aka when it can become a problem in dry climates) that under normal conditions, wet hair aka water content in the hair means weaker hair while it is wet. I do understand that is exaggerated in some cases, but the core of the principle itself is true, as far as I understand.\n\nI’m seeing hyaluronic acid in some leave in products. I understand that it’s water soluble and in shampoo and conditioner it’s washed out, so the implication of it being in wash out products isn’t very consequential. \n\nI’m confused about the implications of it being in leave in products. If the hyaluronic acid does draw water content into the hair, is that such that the hair is in a weaker state when that happens? Or is that not the case or something else is happening? I guess I’m trying to understand, is it just more harmless marketing that is just throwing in an ingredient that isn’t necessarily going to cause a problem, or could it make the hair weaker temporarily due to the increase in water",

I’ve tried to be consistent and patient because I know skincare isn’t instant, but it’s starting to get frustrating. It feels like no matter what I use, my skin just looks the same.\n\nStuff I did:\n\n\\-Used sunscreen every day  \n\\- Used moisturizer + hyaluronic acid  \n\\- Used niacinamide 10% (didn’t really notice anything)  \n\\- Used The Ordinary AHA/BHA peel once a week for months (not at the same time as retinoids or tretinoin yk)  \n\\- Used retinol 1%\n\nI even **used tretinoin 0.025% for months** with just moisturizer and sunscreen, and my skin still looks the same texture-wise. It’s not smoother, and my pores look the same.\n\nRight now I’ve kind of paused because I don’t know what to try next. I don’t want to keep throwing random products at my face if they’re not actually helping. I’ve been thinking about dermastamping at 0.5mm, but I’m worried about messing up my skin or wasting money if it’s not really worth it. Any advice would really help.",

      "content": "I have curly hair, more loose/thick curls than tight (definitely not wavy tho), but in texture very fine, which I think is causing me most of my issues. Its about shoulder length, and my haircut has a lot of layers. I used the season 5 nancy wheeler haircut as a reference for my most recent salon visit if that helps lol. \n\nOn days that I wash my hair, it usually comes out fine, no major complaints. But the next day, my hair is a mess. It is frizzy, the curls are a mix of totally straight and pitiful waves, my bangs look awful and flat, and it looks and feels greasy. My bangs and the length of my hair are usually clearly two separated chunks as well. It looks just awful. One day later! In the past couple weeks, I’ve tried shampooing my hair on that second day, and that's kind of hit or miss. In the past it hasn't worked, but lately I've been getting more success from it. I have no idea why as I haven't changed anything lol but that's just the way it goes with my hair. \n\nMy concern now is that I am really close to getting a new job that would require a long commute three days of the week, meaning I won't have much time in the morning to wash my hair. I would like to switch to washing my hair in the evening, but I have yet to find a successful way to arrange my hair while I sleep without it coming out like I described earlier.\n\nI've tried a silk bonnet, which keeps it smooth but flattens the curls, I've tried the pineapple method, which doesn't do well with my layers, and I think it contributes toward straightening out the length of my curls by pulling them, and I've tried the bonnet and the pineapple combined. Nothing works. \n\nHere’s my wash routine: \n\nEvery other day, I shampoo and condition my hair with Cantù brand shampoo and conditioner, and comb my hair in the shower after I condition. After getting out of the shower, I comb my hair again, then use Cantù brand mousse, and scrunch it into my hair w head upside down. I plop dry w a t shirt for usually thirty minutes or longer, as I’ve found the longer I plop the better it comes out. After unplopping, I have to let it sit and air dry for a little bit before I use a diffuser, scrunching it up with my head upside down. Usually this process is fine.\n\nI don't have any styling products that I can use outside of the shower. I had a gel that I used but I found it to just weigh my hair down more. \n\nAny tips would be greatly appreciated! I am new to learning how to handle my curly hair and I am sick of looking like a rat that got dragged through the gutter every other day of the week. Thank you !! ",

New here, first post, looking for advice/experiences specifically for \"flow\" or mullet-like styles for women with 2C/3A/3B curls.\n\nRoutine: Malibu C for Hard water Wellness shampoo once a week (have very hard water), rest of the week use Shea Moisture shampoo (no more than 2x a week) and conditioner (typically 4x a week). Style with Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie, and Curl Enhancing Gel, depending on the look I'm going for. I air-dry 90% of the time, blow dry with cold air when I'm feeling fancy. I put most of my styling product in while the hair is still dripping wet, and use a combo of prayer hands and roping to help define my curls.\n\nCurrent Style: I usually trim my own hair because I've had my trust broken by one too many \"professionals.\" It's currently shoulder blade length with very few long layers, and styled my own side-part undercut, which I keep up with myself.\n\nI have a formal wedding to go to in a month, so I want to *attempt* to get it cut by a professional. But I'm 30yrs old and have yet to find a short-medium length cut that fits both my face and my vibe. I've been seeing mullet-like cuts on more and more women lately, and as a bisexual girly I'm totally in love with the trend. I'm curious if anyone else with similar curls (2C/3A/3B) has had a similar cut.\n\nWould also love to hear if any curly girlies out there have had good experiences with traditionally masculine cuts, like the \"flow\" cut, angled curtain, shaggy mullet, etc. I plan to air-dry the style most of the time, but willing to blow dry to make it look more elegant.\n\nMy hair has always been a big insecurity for me, so I'm probably hyperfixating on it a bit. I'm also not gonna pay for a professional cut without knowing what I'm getting myself into, and whether or not it's worth paying for. Send help. Lol!",
