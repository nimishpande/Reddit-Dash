Also i dont have anything to apply on my arms for tan.

      "content": "# Best Moisturizers for Winter\n\nAs the cold winter air sets in, skin often becomes dry, flaky, and uncomfortable. A good moisturizer does more than just add hydration, it helps strengthen the skin barrier, prevent water loss, and protect against environmental stressors.\n\n**Dermatologists recommend choosing moisturizers with:**\n\n* **Humectants** (like Glycerin, Hyaluronic Acid) that attract and hold moisture.\n* **Emollients** (like Shea Butter, Ceramides, Almond Oil) that smoothen and soften skin.\n* **Antioxidants** (like Vitamin C, Vitamin E) that protect against dullness and sun damage.\n\nHere are some of the best moisturizers for Indian winters, with their key benefits, ingredients, and trusted user ratings:\n\n# 1. Himalaya Moisturizing Lotion – Hydration &amp; Skin Softening\n\nHimalaya Nourishing Face Moisturizing Lotion is enriched with Aloe Vera (soothes and cools irritation) and Almond Oil (rich in Vitamin E and fatty acids that soften and restore the skin barrier). The formula is lightweight, non-greasy, and suitable for daily use on normal to dry skin.\n\n* **Why it works:** Aloe Vera is clinically shown to reduce dryness and irritation, while Almond Oil provides deep nourishment and skin repair.\n* **Price:** ₹92 (100 ml)\n* **Rating:** 4.2/5 (based on 1,500+ reviews on Amazon India)\n\n# 2. Garnier Moisturizer – Hydrating, Spot Reduction &amp; Sun Tan Care\n\nGarnier Vitamin C Cream (Nourishing Cold Cream) is powered by Vitamin C, a dermatologist-backed antioxidant that helps reduce dark spots, brighten dull skin, and fight oxidative damage. It provides 24-hour hydration with a non-sticky finish, making it perfect for flaky, winter-dull skin.\n\n* **Why it works:** Vitamin C reduces pigmentation and promotes glow, while the hydrating base locks in moisture during harsh winters.\n* **Price:** ₹99 (45 g)\n* **Rating:** 4.1/5 (based on 2,000+ verified reviews on Flipkart &amp; Amazon India)\n\n# 3. Bioderma – Gentle Barrier Repair\n\nBioderma Atoderm Ultra Nourishing Creme is formulated with Niacinamide (restores skin barrier function), Glycerin (pulls in water for long-lasting hydration), and mineral oils that lock in moisture. Dermatologists often recommend it for extremely dry, sensitive, or eczema-prone skin.\n\n* **Why it works:** Niacinamide reduces irritation and strengthens the skin barrier, while Glycerin delivers deep, day-long hydration.\n* **Price:** ₹349 (100 ml)\n* **Rating:** 4.3/5 (based on 3,500+ reviews across online platforms)\n\n# 4. Ponds – Winter Care, Hydration &amp; Soft Skin\n\nPond’s Cold Cream and Light Moisturiser are classics that many households trust. Infused with Vitamin E (a strong antioxidant that protects against damage) and Glycerin (a top humectant that draws in hydration), they provide deep moisturization without clogging pores. The Light Moisturizer variant is especially good for daily use, as it leaves a fresh, non-oily finish.\n\n* **Why it works:** Vitamin E combats winter dullness, while Glycerin ensures skin stays soft, smooth, and plump.\n* **Price:** ₹202 (100 ml)\n* **Rating:** 4.4/5 (based on 5,000+ reviews on Amazon &amp; Nykaa)\n\n# 5. Glow &amp; Lovely – Deep Hydration &amp; Winter Protection\n\nGlow &amp; Lovely Winter Fairness Cream combines multivitamins (B3, C, E) with hydrating agents to give skin moisture plus a mild glow. It absorbs quickly, suits oily to normal skin, and offers a matte finish — a preference for many who dislike heavy creams.\n\n* **Why it works:** Vitamin B3 (Niacinamide) helps even skin tone, while Vitamin C and E protect against oxidative stress and dryness.\n* **Price:** ₹326 (100 ml)\n* **Rating:** 4.2/5 (based on 2,800+ verified users online)\n\nChoosing the right winter moisturizer depends on your skin type, budget, and texture preference. For extremely dry skin, dermatologists recommend barrier-repairing creams with Niacinamide, Ceramides, or Glycerin. For oily or combination skin, lightweight moisturizers with Vitamin C or Aloe Vera work better.\n\nNo matter the choice, look for long-lasting hydration, gentle ingredients, and formulas that support the skin barrier to stay comfortable and glowing all winter long.",

Specifically, I’m looking for:\n\nSilicone-free (most options seem to have dimethicone or other silicones, which don’t suit me)\n\nPhotostable filters (no degradation under sun exposure)\n\nWater / sweat resistant (I spend time outdoors and sweat easily, so this is important)\n\nFormulated for oily skin (lightweight, non-greasy, doesn’t pill)\n\nAvailable from Indian brands (easier to buy locally without worrying about imports)\n\n\nSo far, most I’ve tried are either too greasy, not silicone-free, or don’t hold up with sweat.\n\nDoes anyone know of Indian sunscreens that meet all these criteria? Personal experiences and product names would be super helpful.\n\nThanks in advance!\n",
