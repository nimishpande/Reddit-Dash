      "content": "\n\nSorry for the yap session, my main goals with this post are to figure out my curl type for styling purposes, get product recommendations, and finally figure out my routine (running a diagnostic, if you will). This is my first time posting on Reddit, so I do apologise for any formatting faux pas.\n\nFor the record: I have fine to medium hair, thick hair density (like holy smokes kind of density), low/medium porosity, and I’m pretty much dry from top to bottom (yes, including my humour + personality).\n\nBefore I start with anything, my routine currently looks like this:\nScalp + ends-oiling for as long as it takes for me to get ready to shower. \nDouble Shampoo with Dove Moisture Shampoo (I kinda just use whatever shampoo my mom uses, but I personally prefer the Ichikami Smoothing Shampoo. I find it’s a lot more gentle and better for my dry hair and scalp despite having sulfates.)\nA tub of miscellaneous hair masks for moisture, strengthening, and shine. (I think I have a mix of Ichikami Smoothing Conditioner, Shiseido Tsubaki Moist Conditioner (the red one), Shea Moisture Intensive Hydration Masque, and Hask’s Keratin and Moisturising Masks in there right now. I also mixed Coconut Oil, Olive Oil, and Castor Oil in it.) -&gt; Currently, I use it as a stand-in for conditioner and I tend to leave it on for 20-ish minutes. (I mostly use it to detangle my hair, but I do find that my current routine tends to leave me with pretty tangle-free hair anyways, so I guess it’s more so just to make sure the mask coats every part of my hair.)\nI use the Garnier Sleek and Shine Glass Hair Water to sort of seal everything in, then I use their leave-in conditioner mixed with my DIY hair oil, raking it through my hair and whatnot.\nI finally finish with the Dariya Momori Hair Milk, Miseenscene Hair Serum, and Garnier Sleek and Shine Hair Oil.\n\nSometimes, when I want big volume, I’ll use the Hairitage Volume Mousse, but that’s not always.\n\n-\n\nRelevant details regarding past brands/products I used:\nI used to use 4u by Tia’s styling products (curl cream + curl gel + curl refresher), but I found it did not hold well for my definitely-not-straight hair. It didn't last beyond that wash day. I got so frustrated by the products that I threw them out and stopped styling my hair beyond the desi “straight” look for a while.\n\n-\n\nNow that I’ve gotten that out of the way, I would like to go over pros and cons of my current routine:\n\nPros - \nI pretty much get zero hairfall/breakage or something like it.\nI get big hair growth gains + my hair seems to like having a bit of protection against the Dove shampoo.\nMy hair and scalp aren't as dry. (My hair is pretty much straw by default.)\nMy hair is shiny.\nNo frizz!\n\nCons - \nWhatever curls/waves I got are definitely getting nerfed under all the product.\nThis is a pretty product heavy routine, so my hair is probably getting super weighed down.\nIt takes me 3-4 hours total to shower, and a good majority of it is dedicated to my hair. (Okay, well- I do like my long showers, actually, but still-)\nZero volume. My roots are FLAT.\nMy roots look straight as a ruler with this routine.\n\n-\n\nI pretty much want to keep the benefits of my current routine, but I would like to work on actually defining my hair and getting whatever curls or waves I have going on out of hiding. 4U by Tia’s products were too weak for my hair in terms of definition and hold. I’d probably like something that’s strong on definition and hold, like curl creams and gels. (I’ve been looking at Miss Jessie’s, but I’m open to any other brands that you could find at Walmart or Target!) I would totally love any recommendations for styling products that are like that!\n\nI’ve attached a crap ton of photos above so you all can get a better idea of what I got going on. I think I’m on the wavier/curlier side (2b/2c - dare I say 3a), but they’re all at the ends, so I don’t know if they count. The photo examples online do not help at all. If you all have any idea what my type is, then I would love to read them.\n\nOh, also- does anybody know any good styling techniques for definitely-not-straight hair? I heard about plopping, pixie-diffusing, and stuff like that, but I don’t know if I would benefit from it. Are there any other styling methods I should know? I’m pretty much new to this whole thing, but I’m fully committed to the curly boy/girl/person lifestyle, so please feel free to enlighten me with all the information you've got!\n\nI think that’s everything. If you are reading this, then thank you for taking the time out of your day to help this confused newly-out curly(?) boy out! I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day!",

I didn't think oil could really be something risky or damaging as long as you washed it off with a water based cleanser.\n\nSince starting this cleanser, my skin has become textured and flaky, especially above and below my lips and I'm getting every type of acne under the sun.  Blackheads, white heads, closed comodone, cystic... and my skin is so dry.  I'm also breaking out in places that are not typical for my, like around my eyebrows.\n\nI'm using the same water based cleanser I've been using for about a year and haven't had any problems with it.  It always seemed pretty gentle but could it maybe too harsh to use with an oil cleanser ?   (It's the ordinary glucoside foaming cleanser.)\n\nPlease help!  I am absolutely suffering with the dry and bumpy texture, it's almost worse than the acne!  Did this damage my skin barrier?  Should I focus on hydration?  What should I do to heal my skin?

I usually always at least rinse my face as most products just dry my skin out severely, but I also have acne and deep pores that get clogged so I end up trying things because my acne frustrates me, which then causes an even bigger issue where my face is super flaky. But lately I’ve been occasionally using this face wash and I hadn’t realized it was making it have literal scabs on the side of my nose. I kept using it every other day and it would always make it super dry and have a scab on at least one side. And last night I washed my face with it after not using it for a couple days and it literally split open the sides of my nose. I don’t understand why this is happening and nothing is working for me. I’ve tried numerous moisturizers, face washes, not using anything, serums. Absolutely nothing works. I’m getting very frustrated and self conscious with my appearance as I’m not 19 and I have such gross dry skin. If anyone could recommend things it would be much appreciated. One other thing is I only have hard water at the moment and I’ve wondered if that’s the case, but I’m going to be moving into an apartment soon and it should have soft water.",

      "content": "Hi everyone! This is my first time posting on this sub and I wanted to get your advice. \n\nFor context, I’ve been using Tretinoin for almost a year now: first a prescription of 0.05% and then 0.1%. Both helped clear my skin tremendously and specifically helped with texture around my skin (I used the gel version). However, recently I started noticing little spots that look like acne come up around my mouth and even my nose. I noticed that these areas were somewhat itchy and scaly. I thought I was just breaking out and continued using my tretinoin as usual. Eventually I realized that when I didn’t use tretinoin, the spots would go away so I started taking breaks with my tretinoin, but everytime I came back to using tretinoin again my skin would react even worse than the last time. One day I had a really bad reaction and woke up with tiny spots all around my mouth and some around my nose. At this point I decided to completely stop using tretinoin. \n\nSince then, the area around my mouth has completely cleared up. However, the area around my nose has not and still feels scaly and textured even though it has been around two weeks since I’ve used the tretinoin. I’m not exactly sure what this could be or how I can solve it. I do recall putting clindamycin on the areas around my mouth and that helped along with stopping tretinoin. I have tried putting clindamycin on my nose, but have not seen much notable results. Also, I’ve never had any problems around my nose area for acne. \n\nI’ve uploaded a photo of my nose lol. Your advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks :) \n",

If I rinse my hair with salt water, such as swimming in the ocean, it goes wavy/curly\n\n2. If I rinse my hair in the shower with no shampoo or conditioner, it goes slightly wavy (more like 1c)\n\n3. If I shampoo my hair with regular shampoo and conditioner, it dries pin straight\n\n4. If I shampoo and condition my hair with curly products (not your mothers curl talk) it goes 2a-2b UNTIL it's fully dried, at which point it loses its curl and goes pin straight (I wash my hair at night and let it dry overnight while I sleep using a silk pillowcase. Often, when I wake up, my hair is not completely dry so its curly. Then about 2 hours later my hair is completely dry and losses the curl. So the amount of curl is dependant on how I slept that night. If I slept on more hair and put pressure on it, my hair is more flat and loses the curl and goes more like 1c or 1b instead of 2a or 2b) But its fun while it lasts\n\n5. If I brush with a regular brush OR a brush advertising to be curl friendly (doesnt mess up curls) it goes pin straight\n\n6. If I do the same as 4. but use a bonnet while sleeping and use a curly leave in conditoner (gardier sleek and shine leave in conditioner) and scrunch it like they show in the \"you have curly hair and you just dont know it\" tik toks, it still dries straight eventually the following day (I wash my hair at night). \n\n7. Same happens if I try washing my hair in the morning \n\nHaven't tried defusing because I dont have one or other \"you have curly hair and you dont know it\" tiktoks like the one where you have to finger curl every piece of hair because... well i just dont want to spend 57 minutes doing that unless somehow that lasts me 7 days. \n\nAnyways, when hair stylists are like \"what hair type are you,\" im always like uh its complicated just put me down as 1a or something. I still use curly talk shampoo because even though my waves and curls dont stay, I like the \"grit\" the product has and how it adds a BIT of movement (just barely, still basically pin straight) and I like the root volume so Ill continue to use it. I figured if anyone knew how to solve this mystery, it would be reddit. Im not sure if i have curly or straight hair when people ask, or if theres a way to make it stay curly as it dries, but maybe reddit can help me",

      "content": "Last year, my dermatologist told me I should use PanOxyl benzoyl peroxide 10% to get rid of my cystic acne, and for the whole year, I had been great with no major complications. This summer, I decided to take a break from my benzoyl peroxide, and when I came back after two months, my face felt a bit irritated. Still, I thought that was normal, but for this past week, my face has been breaking out with multiple cystic pimples and feeling tight and raw after washing my face. The area around my mouth has even been peeling. Even after I moisturize, my skin still feels dry and tight. I want to stop using the PanOxyl benzoyl peroxide 10% because of this, and I'm wondering if I should just lower my dose from 10% to 4% or if I should use a different product altogether. Before this break, the Panoxyl had basically cleared my cystic acne, and I'm scared of it breaking out like that again, but I know my face can't take the benzoyl peroxide 10% anymore. Any recommendation or advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nconsulting a few other sources. I’ve been told to start using a hydrating cleanser for a few weeks to help repair my skin barrier. And then reintroduce benzoyl peroxide at 4% every few days. Wanted to know if this is a good idea or not.",

All I want is a healthy discussion and some perspective.\n\nI see a lot of you in this sub using products certain products that contain added fragrance (as in, it's mentioned on the ingredients list). For those of you with sensitive skin, does it not cause any irritation? \n\nI don't really have a severe acne problem (thankfully), it's just mild breakouts now and then. I do have PIH though, from healed breakouts. I have a sensitive skin in general, it's always been like that, not just because of a compromised skin barrier. I have mild oiliness on my face- a combination skin type.\n\nI see lots of cleansing products targeted towards skin that have oiliness but theoretically, those look too harsh to be applied on a face like mine, since it's also sensitive. Plus, most sensitive skin cleansers contain fatty alcohols, which my skin absolutely does not tolerate, my face starts forming bumps which are painful. \n\nWhen it comes to moisturizers, I have tried thick creams (cerave), gone without applying creams in hot weather (used a thick essence instead, rovectin), and currently apply a lotion since it's lightweight (1025 dokdo lotion), yet it causes my face to sweat when I step out in the heat. What do you people use? \n\nComing to sunscreens, I've mostly had a negative relation with it. None of them felt good to wear, so I'm not quite regular with it. Currently I use the Re'equil matte sunscreen (blue one), it's not as bad, but still makes my face a bit greasy as the day goes on. But, I suppose I have to work with it, it's the best one I've stumbled upon so far. It does have added fragrance though (IFRA), is that alright for sensitive skin? Or should I look for alternatives?

They never come to a head, although sometimes the skin does break because I can’t resist touching them, and when that happens clear fluid will ooze from the area until it dries over. \n\nOther than doing a better job of not touching them and further damaging the skin, what should I be doing when I first notice these forming? What about when they at peak inflammation and tenderness? I generally feel helpless with these because I always notice these starting to arise and there’s never been anything I can do stop them from getting progressively worse for a few days before they start to get better.

I used clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide gel alternative days on them but it didn't work. After that I tried salicylic acid and it turned my comedones into very big cystic acnes. I thought it's purging and after that my skin will be clean but then this happened - cystic acnes healed and they turned into these tiny bumps again😭\nSo it's been this never ending cycle of \nTiny bumps -- cystic acne -- tiny bumps \nAt the exact same part of my face.\nNothing seems to work for me. I visited dermatologist also and he advised me to go for comedones extraction. What should I do guys?? \nAlso I've lots of acne marks because of this and now I'm getting small acne scars on my face.\n\nHere are two things I'm looking for - \n\n1. How to treat this comedones situation?\n2. How to remove acne marks?\n\nPlease help.",
