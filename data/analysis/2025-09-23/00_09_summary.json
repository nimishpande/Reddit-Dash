      "content": "I hope this general kind of help is ok in the subreddit. I’ve lurked for a while but never posted!\n\nI’m 25 and my skin has never been worse. I used to have really dry skin and now it’s so oily, even seconds after washing it. It’s textured, red and the lower half is covered in black heads, white heads, red irritations and cysts. It’s also beginning to scar even if I leave everything alone. It started getting worse this time last year so I kept slowly changing things and it’s just got worse and worse. I’ve improved my sleep, my diet, change my pillow case every other day. Nothing is working. I’m so upset at how I look now. I can’t leave the house without makeup and I’m honestly at a loss. I’m so confused about how to figure out my routine.\n\nIn the AM and PM:\n\nMicellar water. My rock, my constant, the only thing I know is ok.\n\nthe ordinary glucoside cleanser. I tried some different cerave ones but they made my skin awful. This seems to make it less red, I’ve been using it for 5 weeks and it hasn’t make a remarkable difference otherwise.\n\nI use hyaluronic acid from ordinary, have for years, my skin was at its best when I started using that.\n\nThe ordinary moisturising factors. Again been doing it for 5 weeks and nothing major in change. I used to use the simple (uk brand maybe?) moisturiser for YEARS but switched when my skin went bad to see if that was clogging it too much? Maybe I should go back as it felt more moisturising.\n\n(AM only) I use the la Roche posay anthelios sunscreen, it’s the oil control one but is this the culprit??\n\nPM only:\n\nThe ordinary salicylic acid about 3 times a week.\n\nThe ordinary 10% niacinamide when I’m not using the salicylic . Used to be great with my skin but now is it too harsh? I’ve already started to phase it out over the past 3 weeks but nothing has changed\n\nThat’s it. I used to use the ordinary BHA mask when my skin was at its best but stopped using that to take things out the occasion when it went bad. Used to use the ordinary salicylic mask but again switched it to a toner.\n\nI don’t know where to go with this, what could be wrong. I use ordinary because I didn’t want lots of the same ingredient compounded so I like how it’s just one ingredient a serum.\n\nI will give my first born to anyone who can give me a vague outline of what I could do.\n\nThank you!",

Though now I am having smaller flare ups almost always on my chin. Generally my T-zone is oily/shiny and my cheeks are matte (I suppose leaning more toward normal than dry).\n\nCurrently I’m being weaned off Spironolactone so hopefully the cystic acne won’t return, but I would love to fix other things about my skin too.\n\nI wash with PanOxyl Acne creamy wash 4% am/pm, use winlevi 1% cream am/pm, trentinoin cream 0.025% 2x/week in the pm, and CeraVe moisturizing cream am/pm. I almost never wear makeup and generally do not put on sunscreen (I know I should), but I am nearly always wearing a spf 50 jacket (usually with the hood up).\n\nIdeally my skincare routine wouldn’t be very long, and I need to stay away from fragrance (I have eczema and allergies to a lot of common fragrance ingredients). I have been through so many different products and systems, but nothing gave me the results I wanted (so I switched to this bare-bones routine). I don’t care for anti-aging/wrinkle control, that has never been a priority. I really just want to control the acne on my chin, help my t-zone be less oily, and smooth my skin texture a bit (I have quite a bit of hyperpigmentation and thankfully minor dimpling from acne scars).\n\nI’m just at a loss of where to start as I prefer not to spend my arms and legs on these things, but I’m now in the position to invest a bit more into my skin.",

Just tight skin, generally dry skin.\n\nWinter is on it's way so it'll be a lot more dry where i am, but even during the summer, my body lotion still left my skin feeling tight. I'm trying to use up what i have which are 2 pretty massive bottles of different things (one is the Everyone brand, and I don't remember the brand of the other but it's not a big or common brand), but in the mean time, i want to search around for a moisturizing lotion for next time. I've also been pairing them with the Palmer's Coco Butter Formula Body Oil to help my skin feel more moisturized, but even then, shortly after, it just feels like the oil has rubbed off and my skin is feeling dry again.\n\nI'm looking for something that will leave my skin feeling quenched, but not sticky or like my skin is suffocating underneath it. I dont like Aveeno because it's sticky and feels like it attracts dust really easily because of that, making my skin feel dirty really quickly after, and i'm not interested in brands that test on animals.\n\nThanks in advance for any recommendations!",

These two have been the most consistent over the past ~half a year to a year, except that a few weeks ago I started doing it twice a day instead of once.\n\nThen, for about the last six weeks, I’ve also been using niacinamide(Anua), also day and night. \n\nAnd then, most recently, I’ve added panoxyls 4% BP, first twice a day, now just at night.\n\nAnd I’ll use the cerave am pm moisturizers as well, but not very consistently.\n\nI’ve also just ordered naturiums azeleic acid and thinking abt replacing the niacinamide with that, cause the niacinamide feels kinda comedogenic and oily.\n\nIn terms of my acne, the thing I struggle with the most is clogged pores, leading to large red pimples, and some redness, especially around my nose. I have noticed a difference if I stop using the products, like when I’m camping or traveling and can’t use them consistently, where my acne will get worse, and I’ll have more and larger pimples, and pore buildup.\nHowever with the products, I’ve noticed it’s only brought my acne down to a certain point, like what’s in the photos, and it’ll kinda fluctuate around that, sometime better sometimes worse, but it’s kinda stuck at that point.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated especially if u know or have been through this kinda acne, and have had success in getting rid of it.",

All I want is a healthy discussion and some perspective.\n\nI see a lot of you in this sub using products certain products that contain added fragrance (as in, it's mentioned on the ingredients list). For those of you with sensitive skin, does it not cause any irritation? \n\nI don't really have a severe acne problem (thankfully), it's just mild breakouts now and then. I do have PIH though, from healed breakouts. I have a sensitive skin in general, it's always been like that, not just because of a compromised skin barrier. I have mild oiliness on my face- a combination skin type.\n\nI see lots of cleansing products targeted towards skin that have oiliness but theoretically, those look too harsh to be applied on a face like mine, since it's also sensitive. Plus, most sensitive skin cleansers contain fatty alcohols, which my skin absolutely does not tolerate, my face starts forming bumps which are painful. \n\nWhen it comes to moisturizers, I have tried thick creams (cerave), gone without applying creams in hot weather (used a thick essence instead, rovectin), and currently apply a lotion since it's lightweight (1025 dokdo lotion), yet it causes my face to sweat when I step out in the heat. What do you people use? \n\nComing to sunscreens, I've mostly had a negative relation with it. None of them felt good to wear, so I'm not quite regular with it. Currently I use the Re'equil matte sunscreen (blue one), it's not as bad, but still makes my face a bit greasy as the day goes on. But, I suppose I have to work with it, it's the best one I've stumbled upon so far. It does have added fragrance though (IFRA), is that alright for sensitive skin? Or should I look for alternatives?

      "content": "19m\n\nI’ve had acne for years and i’m so tired of it. I’ve tried so many things and went to many dermatologists that all tell me the same thing and prescribe me the same stuff.\n\n I have a lot of redness especially around my nose and on the sides of my head, pustules usually around the nose and chest acne.\n\nI’ve been prescribed epiduo(benzoyl peroxide 0.5%), rozex and even doxycycline. While they may have helped a bit in reducing redness, they did not help at all in the long term.\n\nI’m not using anything on my face currently, no products or skin care routine. I’m hesitant and nervous to try putting things on my face again due to me already having sensitive and oily skin and I don’t want products to cause worse breakouts then I already have.\n\nI’ve changed so many things about my lifestyle, I almost never eat junk food, i only cook food with olive oil, drink lots of water, exercise regularly (showering right after too) and cleaning my pillow case frequently. But still, I have skin problems.\n\nI attached photos hoping someone could offer some good advice, i really hope any of you guys could help me because I don’t know what to do anymore.\n\nShould I just not use anything and wait a bit longer? Or should I start a skin care routine? I’m not sure what my next step would be. I know if I go to a GP or dermatologist they’ll just prescribe me the same stuff.",

I used clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide gel alternative days on them but it didn't work. After that I tried salicylic acid and it turned my comedones into very big cystic acnes. I thought it's purging and after that my skin will be clean but then this happened - cystic acnes healed and they turned into these tiny bumps again😭\nSo it's been this never ending cycle of \nTiny bumps -- cystic acne -- tiny bumps \nAt the exact same part of my face.\nNothing seems to work for me. I visited dermatologist also and he advised me to go for comedones extraction. What should I do guys?? \nAlso I've lots of acne marks because of this and now I'm getting small acne scars on my face.\n\nHere are two things I'm looking for - \n\n1.
