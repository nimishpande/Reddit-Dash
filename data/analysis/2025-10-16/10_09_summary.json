I have not always been good with the once-a-day.  Sometimes I fall weeks behind and then make up with half or full pills until I get back up to speed.\n\nFor the first year, my libido ran rampant.  Up, then down, then up.  After that it settled in to what I would call \"slightly below normal.\"  Remained that way for years.  I didn't mind.  Could have been age.  Starting in my mid-40s it dropped substantially but I think that was due to age as well.  No other major sides.\n\nIt arrested my hairloss and regrew hair.  Only in the past couple of years have I noticed loss of hair again, mostly at the temples.  Still not bad for my age.  People tell me I have good hair for my age.\n\nI also tried Minox but had no appetite for greasy twice-daily application and it gave me dandruff.  Going to restart it though now that I know about micro-needling.\n\nI will continue to take Fin for the rest of my life.  I even got my dad on it and it has helped him.

Both Photos are with wet hair. IMO, wet hair is when you really see how thin it's getting. \n\nInitially i was on Rogaine and off brand (Kirkland) for many years, noticed in my late 30s.  Finally got on Fin last year. I opted for topical due to fear of side effects. Topical has worked remarkably well for me and I've had 0 side effects. \n\nJust wanted to post to show the progress i've made in 12 months. First picture was at the begining of a shed. It did get a little worse than what's shown here however i only took pics on the 15th of the month and only after i saw the shed getting better. In hindsight i should have taken photos of the shed because it was very heartbreaking.  However, by Nov it was getting better. Taking photos every month really helped me keep the faith.   \n\nI've also noticed my hair is much more healthy looking. Prior to this it always seemed dried out, almost wiry and tired. Now it seems much healthier, almost bouncier... if that's a thing.  \n\nA lot of people have been blaming creatine for thinning and maybe that is the case for me as well. I've also been using Creatine for over 10+ years, just on gym days - 2-3 times a week. I'm still using it. So take that for what it's worth. \n\nGoodluck!",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

During covid is when I really started trying different products and methods, and I finally found what works for me! I love my hair now! I also think it’s because I was so young back then lol. \n\nROUTINE:\nI wash once a week!

After i get out the shower, i squeeze my hair dry and pat it with a normal towel and then spray on some lush supermilk, some oil (idk the name), and then scrunch in some macadamia garnier fructis hair cream. My waves don't really hold their shape well and get so frizzy and since my hair is kinda short (shoulder length), my hair is like super wide towards the bottom, but flat on my head??? \n\nAnyway, i've been thinking of getting a bonnet but upon looking at other people's recommendations, ive seen a lot of people using satin, and bamboo bonnets??

      "content": "Hi all, I've been a lurker on this sub for a long time and finally I'm caving. I'd love some advice and product recommendations for my skin right now 😭\n\nI've struggled with closed comedones for a long time all across my face but mostly on my cheeks and forehead. I have fairly dry skin, and while I do get lots of CCs I'm fortunate that my acne is pretty minimal and manageable. Since I've had years of trial and error using different products without much luck (and only one constant variable) I'm wondering if my moisturizer could be part of the problem. I was looking into some other threads on here about CeraVe adding to other people's closed comedone problem so I'm thinking that may be the culprit. I don't have a very high budget at the moment, so ideally I'd like to stay within the $10-$20 range if at all possible but I'm open to saving for something that would be worth it, especially as it's getting colder in my area.\n\nThis is my current routine with the products I use, let me know what you think!! Any help and advice is greatly welcome and appreciated!!!\n\nAM:\n\n- rinse with water\n\n- CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion\n\n- Trader Joe's Enrich face lotion SPF 15 over eyelids (other sunscreens have irritated the skin around my eyes)\n\n- Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Face Serum SPF 60 over entire face\n\n\nPM:\n\n- Wash with Dove sensitive bar soap\n\n- CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion\n\n- Differin Gel 0.1% (this is recent within the last 3-4 weeks, I was using 10% benzoyl peroxide for over a year with little to no results)",

While applied, i detangle usually by hand but using a comb yields same results i'd say.\nI then rinse and apply a styling cream (adorn or pantene)\nI try to always go for air-drying because even tho diffusing isn't that bad, it's still not as good.\nThank you everyone!\n\n",

      "content": "Hello! Hope everyone’s doing swell. I am aware this might be the wrong forum, please do bear with me as I do not have enough karma to post this anywhere else.   \n\nTo get to the point, I’m travelling to Mumbai soon for hair transplant and need suggestions. I am so lost.   \n\nI’ve tried accepting my thinning hair and letting it be, but for the past 5 years, my hair part has been getting wider and wider until it’s the first thing people notice about me. I’m only in my mid-twenties. Putting what other people think aside, it’s heavily affecting my self-confidence as well. It is my humble **request to please not suggest I accept my condition** and let it be. Believe me, I’ve truly tried my best! 😂   \n\nA little background on my situation:   \n\nTo start with, I don’t have PCOS. I also have a very oily scalp, but frizzy and dry Type 2B hair. I had a consultation with a dermatologist last year (September 2024) and after seeing the overall thinning and a widening part, they told me it’s alopecia and prescribed me topical minoxidil. If you want to have a visual representation of the current state of my hair, it looks a lot like [this](https://i.redd.it/female-pattern-baldness-help-v0-l8wzw9mic5md1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b00366f0ced22047a73e98756ff2296f05e5c6d).   \n\nAnd so, I’ve tried topical Minoxidil for the past 2 years with little to no progress. I also opted for 2 sessions of PRP, but still nada (I took pictures weekly over the course of those 2 months to see if I was making any progress).   \n\nMy blood test as of 2 months ago included nutritional and metabolic panels (glucose, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, zinc, etc.), endocrinology (TSH, prolactin), kidney function profile, serum lipid profile, liver function profile, and HbA1C.   \n\nEver since I started living on my own in 2019, I’ve had low blood levels to the point where one doctor almost diagnosed me with thalassemia. My haemoglobin, HCT, MCV, and MCH always come out low. Whereas my TIBC and cholesterol levels are slightly high.   \n\nThese levels remained the same this time so doctor prescribed some ferrous fumarate and told me it’s nothing to worry about (regarding my health, not hair) and I should incorporate more greens in my diet. Also told me to take Vitamin D3 (5,000 IU) pills daily for only 3 months. That’s about it.   \n\nMy parents are in their 50s and have a good amount of hair on their heads, and my grandfathers from both sides had fantastic hair until their 70s. My grandmothers, however, also still have thicker hair than I do. So genetics might not play a role here.   \n\nI am also not stressed out. I’ve graduated, have a remote job with amazing coworkers, and live an overall chill life. There are no big decisions weighing on my mind and my mental state is A-OK.   \n\nLastly, I have been avoiding oral meds because I’m afraid they might undo my laser hair removal results. Hence why I’m thinking about a hair transplant now, though I’m still not 100% sure if that’s the right call.   \n\nCost is not a problem. Could you guys please recommend any legitimate and considerate doctors/clinics in Mumbai for a hair transplant procedure for females?   \n\nI would prefer it if it is a female doctor, but if you can’t think of any, please do feel free to suggest any doctor you could vouch for that have results to show for it.   \n\nI wouldn’t mind it if any women want to show me their own results and what worked for them by dropping me a DM.   \n\nIf you’ve reached this point, greatly appreciate you sparing your time reading this. Cheers!",
