      "title": "Don't give up!!!! My 2 year progress in pictures.",
      "content": "In case you are thinking of giving up (because I was SO close to that at many points over the past 2 years) please don't! \n\nI grew up in the 90s before anyone knew how to properly care of curly hair, and I'm also Korean so I resented the fact that my hair was not slick, shiny, and straight like the other Korean girls I knew.  My mom used to scrunch my hair with mousse and air dry and send me to school with big, frizzy, triangle hair.  I hated it.  So in high school I started flat ironing my hair straight and also had various relaxing treatments done over the years. My hair was always in a state of incredible heat damage and I didn't even realize how bad it was. \n\nAny attempts in my pre-curly era to wear my hair naturally ended in huge fails because of the heat damage, lack of a good curly cut, and lack of proper know-how for product applications and styling techniques. I had lost hope I'd ever be able to figure it out. \n\n2 years ago something snapped and I decided to finally REALLY go for it.  I stopped flat ironing my hair completely. Cold turkey. At first it was bad. Really bad. As my new growth came in I had 2 vastly different textures and it looked awful. I had no clue how to apply products correctly for my hair texture. Every single wash day was a new trial and error. But I stuck it out. \n\nThis past January I got a good curly haircut and removed ALL of the heat damaged length.  They cut off about 10 inches. After that the remaining hair became SO curly. I was shocked. What I thought was more of a crimpy curl pattern had turned into actual tight ringlet curls.\n\nMy dream is to have long hair again but this time with curls. Now for the first time in my life I feel confident that I can actually get there and am so happy I stuck it out to this point and excited for the future. It's not perfect and I'm still learning more all the time but looking back I'm happy I didn't give up early on when it was so tempting to do so. I usually don't post anything online but I so badly wanted all the curlies out there who are thinking of giving up to know that you are not alone, and it will be SO worth it in the end. \n\npic 1 - Aug 2023 - the day I decided to go for it!\n\npic 2 - Mar 2024 - new growth with more curly texture\n\npic 3&amp;4 - Nov 2024 - new growth continues\n\npic 5 - Jan 2025 - after big curly cut\n\npic 6 - Jul 2025 - growing out, curls galore!\n\npic 7 - Sep 2025 - most recent progress\n\n\n\nCurrent products I use:\n\nCurlsmith Essential Moisture Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, Curl Reset Detox Shampoo, Double Cream Deep Quencher, Weightless Air Dry Cream, Hold Me Softly Style Balm, Curl Defining Souffle, Bonding Oil.\\* \n\n\\*I really think that the styling technique matters MUCH more than the specific product used, and while I like Curlsmith I'm sure I would get similar results with many other product brands and types.  \n\nRoutine:\n\nI alternate using the moisture shampoo and detox shampoo each wash, which is typically about every 5 days.  Out of the shower while soaking wet I put in a little air dry cream and then the style balm I brush in sections so that product is evenly distributed.  Then in small sections I apply the curl souffle with a bounce curl brush.  I plop for a few minutes then diffuse until I get tired or run out of time (usually 15 minutes) and let it air dry the rest.  Once completely dry and crunchy I scrunch out the crunch with the bonding oil. ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

(topical Fin every 2 days as my derm suggested it would have the same impact as every day).\n\nApprox 3 years Min, 2 years topical Finasteride - but I'm not sure what I should be expecting.\n\nI previously tried oral Finasteride, but believed I got sides about a month into it, with painful armpits, and extremely sore/itchy nipples.\n\nI recently saw my derm again, and he suggested I just stick with what I have been doing. However, I said I was not satisfied with where this has gotten me, and we agreed on increasing the topical finasteride from 0.1% to 0.25% concentration.\n\nI believe I still have mild gyno, (even before hairloss) and did not want to worsen it, so my dermatologist recommended me to switch to topical Fin, once every 2 days instead.\n\nI put the topical Finasteride very liberally on my head, and don't really measure how much I use as long as I cover all the regions thoroughly. I still shed a lot everyday. Never saw an increase in shedding at the start of using Fin, rather just the consistent shedding i've been experiencing since I started losing hair.\n\n\n\nWhat should I be doing in this position? I'm desperately wanting to regrow my hairline and what I have lost. Must I change back to oral finasteride to achieve maximum results? Would I need to microneedle, etc? Or am I not using the topical products efficiently enough?\n\nI've used the products for a while now - so it probably isn't a case of \"not using it long enough\". \n\nSo maybe just keep doing what my doctor has suggested? Their name has appeared quite a few times on this sub, so I know they are reputable and trusted.\n\nAny general advice from reddit? How can I regrow my hair?",

      "content": "Hi all! About 2 months ago, I transitioned away from all skincare products (except nightly face wash/morning sunscreen) and used metro cream to clear up what was likely a perioral dermatitis flare up around my nose and mouth. I had been using tretinoin since January, and slowly built up a nice tolerance &amp; routine of using tretinoin every night (from 3x weekly, to every other day, to every day over the course of a month or two). I loved what it was doing for my skin, and was pretty bummed having to stop tretinoin and all other skincare in August to clear up this rash!\n\nI’m not positive what caused the flare up, and I’ve read it can often be quite random and idiopathic. However, I suspect it may have been my overuse of occlusives (specifically layers of aquaphor) around my nose and mouth area because these areas were most sensitive/prone to dryness from tretinoin. I also would do the sandwich method with a pretty thick moisturizer (La Roche Posay Triple Repair).\n\nI’ve now finished up my course of metrodinazole, and my dermatologist gave me the clear to start back up on tretinoin. She recommended using simple moisturizerizers like Cera Ve &amp; Vanicream, but I’m worried about my skin being crazy dry, or any product causing a flare up again.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience or insight on this? I’d appreciate any tips or advice on a new routine. Thanks!",

While applied, i detangle usually by hand but using a comb yields same results i'd say.\nI then rinse and apply a styling cream (adorn or pantene)\nI try to always go for air-drying because even tho diffusing isn't that bad, it's still not as good.\nThank you everyone!\n\n",
