I am allergic to a lot of shampoos and the like due to MCAS so finding things that don't make my entire head itch is hard, and I'm easily exhausted due to ME/CFS so I try to keep my routine simple.

I have not always been good with the once-a-day.  Sometimes I fall weeks behind and then make up with half or full pills until I get back up to speed.\n\nFor the first year, my libido ran rampant.  Up, then down, then up.  After that it settled in to what I would call \"slightly below normal.\"  Remained that way for years.  I didn't mind.  Could have been age.  Starting in my mid-40s it dropped substantially but I think that was due to age as well.  No other major sides.\n\nIt arrested my hairloss and regrew hair.  Only in the past couple of years have I noticed loss of hair again, mostly at the temples.  Still not bad for my age.  People tell me I have good hair for my age.\n\nI also tried Minox but had no appetite for greasy twice-daily application and it gave me dandruff.  Going to restart it though now that I know about micro-needling.\n\nI will continue to take Fin for the rest of my life.  I even got my dad on it and it has helped him.  He's been on it for \\~10 years and he's 86.  No sides I know of.\n\nHappy to answer any questions.",

Both Photos are with wet hair. IMO, wet hair is when you really see how thin it's getting. \n\nInitially i was on Rogaine and off brand (Kirkland) for many years, noticed in my late 30s.  Finally got on Fin last year. I opted for topical due to fear of side effects. Topical has worked remarkably well for me and I've had 0 side effects. \n\nJust wanted to post to show the progress i've made in 12 months. First picture was at the begining of a shed. It did get a little worse than what's shown here however i only took pics on the 15th of the month and only after i saw the shed getting better. In hindsight i should have taken photos of the shed because it was very heartbreaking.  However, by Nov it was getting better. Taking photos every month really helped me keep the faith.   \n\nI've also noticed my hair is much more healthy looking. Prior to this it always seemed dried out, almost wiry and tired. Now it seems much healthier, almost bouncier... if that's a thing.  \n\nA lot of people have been blaming creatine for thinning and maybe that is the case for me as well. I've also been using Creatine for over 10+ years, just on gym days - 2-3 times a week. I'm still using it. So take that for what it's worth. \n\nGoodluck!",

      "title": "What is the science behind 'less damaging' hair dryers such as the Dyson?",
      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoeâ„¢ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

After i get out the shower, i squeeze my hair dry and pat it with a normal towel and then spray on some lush supermilk, some oil (idk the name), and then scrunch in some macadamia garnier fructis hair cream. My waves don't really hold their shape well and get so frizzy and since my hair is kinda short (shoulder length), my hair is like super wide towards the bottom, but flat on my head??? \n\nAnyway, i've been thinking of getting a bonnet but upon looking at other people's recommendations, ive seen a lot of people using satin, and bamboo bonnets?? I thought they HAD to be silk for it to actually work and prevent frizz??? how does this work? What would you recommend to someone with hair like mine? \n\nANY tips on how to take care of my hair would be greatly appreciated!",

I am aware this might be the wrong forum, please do bear with me as I do not have enough karma to post this anywhere else.   \n\nTo get to the point, Iâ€™m travelling to Mumbai soon for hair transplant and need suggestions. I am so lost.   \n\nIâ€™ve tried accepting my thinning hair and letting it be, but for the past 5 years, my hair part has been getting wider and wider until itâ€™s the first thing people notice about me. Iâ€™m only in my mid-twenties. Putting what other people think aside, itâ€™s heavily affecting my self-confidence as well. It is my humble **request to please not suggest I accept my condition** and let it be. Believe me, Iâ€™ve truly tried my best! ðŸ˜‚   \n\nA little background on my situation:   \n\nTo start with, I donâ€™t have PCOS. I also have a very oily scalp, but frizzy and dry Type 2B hair. I had a consultation with a dermatologist last year (September 2024) and after seeing the overall thinning and a widening part, they told me itâ€™s alopecia and prescribed me topical minoxidil. If you want to have a visual representation of the current state of my hair, it looks a lot like [this](https://i.redd.it/female-pattern-baldness-help-v0-l8wzw9mic5md1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b00366f0ced22047a73e98756ff2296f05e5c6d).   \n\nAnd so, Iâ€™ve tried topical Minoxidil for the past 2 years with little to no progress. I also opted for 2 sessions of PRP, but still nada (I took pictures weekly over the course of those 2 months to see if I was making any progress).   \n\nMy blood test as of 2 months ago included nutritional and metabolic panels (glucose, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, zinc, etc.), endocrinology (TSH, prolactin), kidney function profile, serum lipid profile, liver function profile, and HbA1C.   \n\nEver since I started living on my own in 2019, Iâ€™ve had low blood levels to the point where one doctor almost diagnosed me with thalassemia. My haemoglobin, HCT, MCV, and MCH always come out low. Whereas my TIBC and cholesterol levels are slightly high.   \n\nThese levels remained the same this time so doctor prescribed some ferrous fumarate and told me itâ€™s nothing to worry about (regarding my health, not hair) and I should incorporate more greens in my diet. Also told me to take Vitamin D3 (5,000 IU) pills daily for only 3 months. Thatâ€™s about it.   \n\nMy parents are in their 50s and have a good amount of hair on their heads, and my grandfathers from both sides had fantastic hair until their 70s. My grandmothers, however, also still have thicker hair than I do. So genetics might not play a role here.   \n\nI am also not stressed out. Iâ€™ve graduated, have a remote job with amazing coworkers, and live an overall chill life. There are no big decisions weighing on my mind and my mental state is A-OK.   \n\nLastly, I have been avoiding oral meds because Iâ€™m afraid they might undo my laser hair removal results. Hence why Iâ€™m thinking about a hair transplant now, though Iâ€™m still not 100% sure if thatâ€™s the right call.   \n\nCost is not a problem. Could you guys please recommend any legitimate and considerate doctors/clinics in Mumbai for a hair transplant procedure for females?   \n\nI would prefer it if it is a female doctor, but if you canâ€™t think of any, please do feel free to suggest any doctor you could vouch for that have results to show for it.   \n\nI wouldnâ€™t mind it if any women want to show me their own results and what worked for them by dropping me a DM.   \n\nIf youâ€™ve reached this point, greatly appreciate you sparing your time reading this. Cheers!",

      "title": "[Acne] What helped me heal my hormonal mouth/chin acne",
      "content": "Unfortunately I do not have any before pictures (mostly due to me being too embarrassed to take pictures of my breakout at the time). I am 21F and have suffered from stubborn painful acne around my mouth and chin areas for the longest time. I have been on Accutane twice and both times my acne always came back full force in these areas 7-10 months after finishing the medication. I had also been on tretinoin to no avail.\n\nRecently I did a bunch of research into ways people have healed their mouth/chin acne and tried out a bunch of stuff that people recommended and my acne is almost fully healed save for a few tiny invisible clogged pores here and there. But no painful pimples! I have always been under the assumption that my acne is hormonal, but despite my derms recommendations I refused to go on birth control or spironolactone after all the horror stories I've heard from people who've tried those methods. I was also just sick of going on meds for my acne. I wanted to try and heal with diet and lifestyle changes.\n\nI started all of these methods at the same time so I couldn't tell you which one (or few) of these worked but I like to think they all contributed a little bit in their own ways. I am not a dermatologist or a doctor, I am just sharing what worked for me! Always listen to your derm before anybody else and don't try any new vitamins or healing methods without consulting your doctor first:\n\n**- SLS free toothpaste:**Â along with washing my face AFTER brushing my teeth, I heard SLS can be pretty nasty on the skin and switched to a toothpaste that is SLS free. Most Sensodyne toothpastes are SLS free but check the packaging first\n\n**- Spearmint tea:**Â I never got my hormones tested but the nature of my acne, plus other PCOS symptoms I have been experiencing, led me to believe my acne is hormonal, and spearmint tea is said to lower androgens so I started drinking 1-2 cups per day. I hate the taste so I usually take it iced with honey to make it more palatable. I recently ordered spearmint in capsule form to avoid having to drink it. PLEASE TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR FIRST before trying to change your hormones in any way or before starting any new vitamins!\n\n**- Cutting out dairy:**Â I found that my breakouts became more angry and cystic after consuming cows milk specifically. Not sure about cheese and yogurt, I just know that milk is a big trigger for my acne. Cutting out most dairy products and switching to non-dairy alternatives has calmed my skin\n\n**- Azelaic Acid:**Â I used the Anua Azelaic Acid for a while, however it didn't do anything for me and burnt my skin when I used it. I switched to Azclear and it's been serving me well so far. People complain that it piles, however I find if you only use a pea-sized amount for the whole face and wait 5-10 minutes between it and moisturiser it sits on the skin fine without piling. I've also heard good things about Finacea and Paula's Choice.\n\nAs I said, it might have only been one of these lifestyle changes that fixed my skin but I continue to do all of them regardless because my skin is finally getting back to where I want it to be. It took me about a week to start seeing results but this may vary for other people. What works for me may not work for other people so please keep that in mind if you decide to try any of these!",

Iâ€™m a male in my early 40â€™s who has battled bad acne through my whole life and just never really took great care of my skin. I now have extremely noticeable deep rooted acne scarring (holes) on my face that I have come to terms with over the years. I will live with this for the rest of my life. It wasnâ€™t purely eout of laziness on my part, but I honestly was just not very well educated on skin care. I never had good experiences with dermatologists or aestheticians. \n\nOver the last 3 years, I have become obsessed with skin care! Gosh, I wish I can go back in time and do it all over again knowing what I know now. I was hoping to get some advice on my current routine. Iâ€™ve been pretty strict with it and it definitely has reduced the amount of breakouts I have. Iâ€™m looking for ways I can enhance my routine and get any product recommendations. I have combination oily and dry skin. \n\nMy current routine:\n\nMorning:\n-La Roche Posay oil foaming cleanser\n-CeraVe AM Moisturizer with SPF\n\nEvening:\n-La Roche Posay Toleraine foaming cleanser\n-Tretinoin 0.05\n-CeraVe PM Moisturizer\n\n-2-3 nights per week I replace the Tretinoin with CeraVe Exfoliating Night Treatment (leave on face)\n-Just came back from a trip to Greece and brought back with me Body Farm Donkey Milk exfoliating scrub (which I LOVE). Iâ€™d love to try more product with donkey milk. \n\nAny advice or tips, I would so greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much!",

      "content": "A little backstory, I have used soap on my face for most of my life and I thought that was the right way. That caused my skin barrier to be fucked up bad, but I never suffered from acne. I had a very dry flaky skin tho, and this year I decided to reasearch about it.\n\nSo I got a skincare routine with: cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen. And my skin barrier has been repaired. But I've had bad past experiences with moisturizers, they usually cause me to break out (i've never had this problem before). I have tried Minimalist B5 moisturizer and Bioderma Atoderm and I finally landed on SebaMed Clear Face Gel, which was the lightest moisturizer I could find, solely based on humectants. The other ones always caused tons of bumps to appear on my face within a week of use.\n\nThis was working all fine till the winters hit.

That caused my skin barrier to be fucked up bad, but I never suffered from acne. I had a very dry flaky skin tho, and this year I decided to reasearch about it.\n\nSo I got a skincare routine with: cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen. And my skin barrier has been repaired. But I've had bad past experiences with moisturizers, they usually cause me to break out (i've never had this problem before). I have tried Minimalist B5 moisturizer and Bioderma Atoderm and I finally landed on SebaMed Clear Face Gel, which was the lightest moisturizer I could find, solely based on humectants. The other ones always caused tons of bumps to appear on my face within a week of use.\n\nThis was working all fine till the winters hit. Now it seems that the SebaMed one is not enough cuz my face has a little patch on the cheek where I see the skin sort of peeling off, and the area seems dry.
