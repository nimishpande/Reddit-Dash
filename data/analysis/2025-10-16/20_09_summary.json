      "title": "Don't give up!!!! My 2 year progress in pictures.",
      "content": "In case you are thinking of giving up (because I was SO close to that at many points over the past 2 years) please don't! \n\nI grew up in the 90s before anyone knew how to properly care of curly hair, and I'm also Korean so I resented the fact that my hair was not slick, shiny, and straight like the other Korean girls I knew.  My mom used to scrunch my hair with mousse and air dry and send me to school with big, frizzy, triangle hair.  I hated it.  So in high school I started flat ironing my hair straight and also had various relaxing treatments done over the years. My hair was always in a state of incredible heat damage and I didn't even realize how bad it was. \n\nAny attempts in my pre-curly era to wear my hair naturally ended in huge fails because of the heat damage, lack of a good curly cut, and lack of proper know-how for product applications and styling techniques. I had lost hope I'd ever be able to figure it out. \n\n2 years ago something snapped and I decided to finally REALLY go for it.  I stopped flat ironing my hair completely. Cold turkey. At first it was bad. Really bad. As my new growth came in I had 2 vastly different textures and it looked awful. I had no clue how to apply products correctly for my hair texture. Every single wash day was a new trial and error. But I stuck it out. \n\nThis past January I got a good curly haircut and removed ALL of the heat damaged length.  They cut off about 10 inches. After that the remaining hair became SO curly. I was shocked. What I thought was more of a crimpy curl pattern had turned into actual tight ringlet curls.\n\nMy dream is to have long hair again but this time with curls. Now for the first time in my life I feel confident that I can actually get there and am so happy I stuck it out to this point and excited for the future. It's not perfect and I'm still learning more all the time but looking back I'm happy I didn't give up early on when it was so tempting to do so. I usually don't post anything online but I so badly wanted all the curlies out there who are thinking of giving up to know that you are not alone, and it will be SO worth it in the end. \n\npic 1 - Aug 2023 - the day I decided to go for it!\n\npic 2 - Mar 2024 - new growth with more curly texture\n\npic 3&amp;4 - Nov 2024 - new growth continues\n\npic 5 - Jan 2025 - after big curly cut\n\npic 6 - Jul 2025 - growing out, curls galore!\n\npic 7 - Sep 2025 - most recent progress\n\n\n\nCurrent products I use:\n\nCurlsmith Essential Moisture Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, Curl Reset Detox Shampoo, Double Cream Deep Quencher, Weightless Air Dry Cream, Hold Me Softly Style Balm, Curl Defining Souffle, Bonding Oil.\\* \n\n\\*I really think that the styling technique matters MUCH more than the specific product used, and while I like Curlsmith I'm sure I would get similar results with many other product brands and types.  \n\nRoutine:\n\nI alternate using the moisture shampoo and detox shampoo each wash, which is typically about every 5 days.  Out of the shower while soaking wet I put in a little air dry cream and then the style balm I brush in sections so that product is evenly distributed.  Then in small sections I apply the curl souffle with a bounce curl brush.  I plop for a few minutes then diffuse until I get tired or run out of time (usually 15 minutes) and let it air dry the rest.  Once completely dry and crunchy I scrunch out the crunch with the bonding oil. ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

(topical Fin every 2 days as my derm suggested it would have the same impact as every day).\n\nApprox 3 years Min, 2 years topical Finasteride - but I'm not sure what I should be expecting.\n\nI previously tried oral Finasteride, but believed I got sides about a month into it, with painful armpits, and extremely sore/itchy nipples.\n\nI recently saw my derm again, and he suggested I just stick with what I have been doing. However, I said I was not satisfied with where this has gotten me, and we agreed on increasing the topical finasteride from 0.1% to 0.25% concentration.\n\nI believe I still have mild gyno, (even before hairloss) and did not want to worsen it, so my dermatologist recommended me to switch to topical Fin, once every 2 days instead.\n\nI put the topical Finasteride very liberally on my head, and don't really measure how much I use as long as I cover all the regions thoroughly. I still shed a lot everyday. Never saw an increase in shedding at the start of using Fin, rather just the consistent shedding i've been experiencing since I started losing hair.\n\n\n\nWhat should I be doing in this position? I'm desperately wanting to regrow my hairline and what I have lost. Must I change back to oral finasteride to achieve maximum results? Would I need to microneedle, etc? Or am I not using the topical products efficiently enough?\n\nI've used the products for a while now - so it probably isn't a case of \"not using it long enough\". \n\nSo maybe just keep doing what my doctor has suggested? Their name has appeared quite a few times on this sub, so I know they are reputable and trusted.\n\nAny general advice from reddit? How can I regrow my hair?",

But as you can imagine, her skin went through a lot during this time. It is important that she has a routine both for her self esteem and mental health.\n\nI don’t want to post a photo, but she has quite a few dark spots now — similar to sun spots — and her skin tone looks very uneven, with general dullness and some discoloration. She’s always had deep under-eye hollows and dark circles, so that’s nothing new, but overall her skin just looks tired and damaged.\n\nI’d love some advice for a minimal, maintainable, but effective skincare routine for her — something realistic given her situation.

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Sorry for what's probably going to be a long post, but i kinda need help.\nVery first pic i was in my teens, no idea how to care for my hair AT ALL.\nI then got an undercut and let the top grow for a couple years, along with trying to experiment with appropriate products and routines.\nPic 2 and 3 was my longest, i decided to trim a bit and i think it kinda looks better and it's definitely more practical (4 it is still kinda wet, 7 is the shortest i had, styled with gel).\nIt seemd like results are always inconsistent, even tho my routine barely changed.\nCurrently im trying to get my undercat to reach the same length as my top, more volume should be a good idea, right?\nAnyway, about my routine, i wash my hair 3 times a week (4 tops).\nShampoo: i have to use kelual ds (or else my scalp acts up)\nConditioner: either pantene (i've seen no difference between the curly and straight hair one) or garnier fructis. While applied, i detangle usually by hand but using a comb yields same results i'd say.\nI then rinse and apply a styling cream (adorn or pantene)\nI try to always go for air-drying because even tho diffusing isn't that bad, it's still not as good.\nThank you everyone!\n\n",

      "content": "Hello!\nSo I'm starting this new routine following some tips from the docs and yada yada...I know I just started and that maybe I have to wait a bit more for better results to show up (It's just been a week and a half), but I wanted to know if I might have got everything down the right way? Here's my assumptions:\n\nHair pattern is 3A, medium porosity, low density, fine texture\n\n\nMy old hair routine was just using some shampoo, conditioner, comb, and cream before drying with diffusor, first picture is what it looks like after all that\n\nMy new hair routine consists of:\nUsing Davines Solu Shampoo (clarifying shampoo, just for the 1st wash and I'll try again in about a month) or Davines Love Curl Shampoo (2nd wash pic). Scrunching the scalp with my fingertips in circular motions, wash off, then apply Davines Love Curl Conditioner so that it's all slimy (in a scrunching way), comb, then wait a few minutes before washing if off (not completely). Once I'm done there, I put on a towel for 10 mins and then apply Davines Love Curl Cream on wet hair (scrunching) and then dry with diffusor, although not completely but quite a lot\n\nI know I should experiment more and give it some time, but am I going the right way? I'd like to see more uniform curls \n\nThanks and sorry for my english!",
