I have not always been good with the once-a-day.  Sometimes I fall weeks behind and then make up with half or full pills until I get back up to speed.\n\nFor the first year, my libido ran rampant.  Up, then down, then up.  After that it settled in to what I would call \"slightly below normal.\"  Remained that way for years.  I didn't mind.  Could have been age.  Starting in my mid-40s it dropped substantially but I think that was due to age as well.  No other major sides.\n\nIt arrested my hairloss and regrew hair.  Only in the past couple of years have I noticed loss of hair again, mostly at the temples.  Still not bad for my age.  People tell me I have good hair for my age.\n\nI also tried Minox but had no appetite for greasy twice-daily application and it gave me dandruff.  Going to restart it though now that I know about micro-needling.\n\nI will continue to take Fin for the rest of my life.  I even got my dad on it and it has helped him.  He's been on it for \\~10 years and he's 86.  No sides I know of.\n\nHappy to answer any questions.",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Should I add or change my routine? I would love any and all advice on the subject because I genuinely have no clue but Im too broke for botox!!!

Between work, parenting, and trying to stay sane, I haven’t really thought about how I present myself beyond “clean and Zoom-ready.”\n\nBut now that I have a little breathing room, I want to feel like myself again, not just “the mom in a hoodie who used to be put-together.” I don’t want a full glam look, just a polished, natural routine that makes me feel awake and confident on normal days (and maybe during interviews).\n\nHere’s where I’m lost:\n\n* I never figured out my undertone. Every foundation either oxidizes or looks flat.\n* Lip colors always seem too much or too dull.\n* I’ve had makeup done for weddings, but it’s always heavy. I want to learn my face, not the bridal version of it.\n\nHas anyone ever gone to a pro just to find their “look”? Like a makeup lesson, not an event? Was it worth it? Or is this something I can figure out with YouTube and a good mirror?\n\nWould love recs from anyone who hit that “time to reintroduce myself to me” phase.",

After i get out the shower, i squeeze my hair dry and pat it with a normal towel and then spray on some lush supermilk, some oil (idk the name), and then scrunch in some macadamia garnier fructis hair cream. My waves don't really hold their shape well and get so frizzy and since my hair is kinda short (shoulder length), my hair is like super wide towards the bottom, but flat on my head??? \n\nAnyway, i've been thinking of getting a bonnet but upon looking at other people's recommendations, ive seen a lot of people using satin, and bamboo bonnets?? I thought they HAD to be silk for it to actually work and prevent frizz??? how does this work?

      "content": "Hi all, I've been a lurker on this sub for a long time and finally I'm caving. I'd love some advice and product recommendations for my skin right now 😭\n\nI've struggled with closed comedones for a long time all across my face but mostly on my cheeks and forehead. I have fairly dry skin, and while I do get lots of CCs I'm fortunate that my acne is pretty minimal and manageable. Since I've had years of trial and error using different products without much luck (and only one constant variable) I'm wondering if my moisturizer could be part of the problem. I was looking into some other threads on here about CeraVe adding to other people's closed comedone problem so I'm thinking that may be the culprit. I don't have a very high budget at the moment, so ideally I'd like to stay within the $10-$20 range if at all possible but I'm open to saving for something that would be worth it, especially as it's getting colder in my area.\n\nThis is my current routine with the products I use, let me know what you think!! Any help and advice is greatly welcome and appreciated!!!\n\nAM:\n\n- rinse with water\n\n- CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion\n\n- Trader Joe's Enrich face lotion SPF 15 over eyelids (other sunscreens have irritated the skin around my eyes)\n\n- Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Face Serum SPF 60 over entire face\n\n\nPM:\n\n- Wash with Dove sensitive bar soap\n\n- CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion\n\n- Differin Gel 0.1% (this is recent within the last 3-4 weeks, I was using 10% benzoyl peroxide for over a year with little to no results)",

While applied, i detangle usually by hand but using a comb yields same results i'd say.\nI then rinse and apply a styling cream (adorn or pantene)\nI try to always go for air-drying because even tho diffusing isn't that bad, it's still not as good.\nThank you everyone!\n\n",

It improves for a bit, and then right before my period, it flares up again—getting red, inflamed, and textured all over.
