I have not always been good with the once-a-day.  Sometimes I fall weeks behind and then make up with half or full pills until I get back up to speed.\n\nFor the first year, my libido ran rampant.  Up, then down, then up.  After that it settled in to what I would call \"slightly below normal.\"  Remained that way for years.  I didn't mind.  Could have been age.  Starting in my mid-40s it dropped substantially but I think that was due to age as well.  No other major sides.\n\nIt arrested my hairloss and regrew hair.  Only in the past couple of years have I noticed loss of hair again, mostly at the temples.  Still not bad for my age.  People tell me I have good hair for my age.\n\nI also tried Minox but had no appetite for greasy twice-daily application and it gave me dandruff.  Going to restart it though now that I know about micro-needling.\n\nI will continue to take Fin for the rest of my life.  I even got my dad on it and it has helped him.  He's been on it for \\~10 years and he's 86.  No sides I know of.\n\nHappy to answer any questions.",

      "content": "In case you are thinking of giving up (because I was SO close to that at many points over the past 2 years) please don't! \n\nI grew up in the 90s before anyone knew how to properly care of curly hair, and I'm also Korean so I resented the fact that my hair was not slick, shiny, and straight like the other Korean girls I knew.  My mom used to scrunch my hair with mousse and air dry and send me to school with big, frizzy, triangle hair.  I hated it.  So in high school I started flat ironing my hair straight and also had various relaxing treatments done over the years. My hair was always in a state of incredible heat damage and I didn't even realize how bad it was. \n\nAny attempts in my pre-curly era to wear my hair naturally ended in huge fails because of the heat damage, lack of a good curly cut, and lack of proper know-how for product applications and styling techniques. I had lost hope I'd ever be able to figure it out. \n\n2 years ago something snapped and I decided to finally REALLY go for it.  I stopped flat ironing my hair completely. Cold turkey. At first it was bad. Really bad. As my new growth came in I had 2 vastly different textures and it looked awful. I had no clue how to apply products correctly for my hair texture. Every single wash day was a new trial and error. But I stuck it out. \n\nThis past January I got a good curly haircut and removed ALL of the heat damaged length.  They cut off about 10 inches. After that the remaining hair became SO curly. I was shocked. What I thought was more of a crimpy curl pattern had turned into actual tight ringlet curls.\n\nMy dream is to have long hair again but this time with curls. Now for the first time in my life I feel confident that I can actually get there and am so happy I stuck it out to this point and excited for the future. It's not perfect and I'm still learning more all the time but looking back I'm happy I didn't give up early on when it was so tempting to do so. I usually don't post anything online but I so badly wanted all the curlies out there who are thinking of giving up to know that you are not alone, and it will be SO worth it in the end. \n\npic 1 - Aug 2023 - the day I decided to go for it!\n\npic 2 - Mar 2024 - new growth with more curly texture\n\npic 3&amp;4 - Nov 2024 - new growth continues\n\npic 5 - Jan 2025 - after big curly cut\n\npic 6 - Jul 2025 - growing out, curls galore!\n\npic 7 - Sep 2025 - most recent progress\n\n\n\nCurrent products I use:\n\nCurlsmith Essential Moisture Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, Curl Reset Detox Shampoo, Double Cream Deep Quencher, Weightless Air Dry Cream, Hold Me Softly Style Balm, Curl Defining Souffle, Bonding Oil.\\* \n\n\\*I really think that the styling technique matters MUCH more than the specific product used, and while I like Curlsmith I'm sure I would get similar results with many other product brands and types.  \n\nRoutine:\n\nI alternate using the moisture shampoo and detox shampoo each wash, which is typically about every 5 days.  Out of the shower while soaking wet I put in a little air dry cream and then the style balm I brush in sections so that product is evenly distributed.  Then in small sections I apply the curl souffle with a bounce curl brush.  I plop for a few minutes then diffuse until I get tired or run out of time (usually 15 minutes) and let it air dry the rest.  Once completely dry and crunchy I scrunch out the crunch with the bonding oil. ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Between work, parenting, and trying to stay sane, I haven’t really thought about how I present myself beyond “clean and Zoom-ready.”\n\nBut now that I have a little breathing room, I want to feel like myself again, not just “the mom in a hoodie who used to be put-together.” I don’t want a full glam look, just a polished, natural routine that makes me feel awake and confident on normal days (and maybe during interviews).\n\nHere’s where I’m lost:\n\n* I never figured out my undertone. Every foundation either oxidizes or looks flat.\n* Lip colors always seem too much or too dull.\n* I’ve had makeup done for weddings, but it’s always heavy. I want to learn my face, not the bridal version of it.\n\nHas anyone ever gone to a pro just to find their “look”? Like a makeup lesson, not an event? Was it worth it? Or is this something I can figure out with YouTube and a good mirror?\n\nWould love recs from anyone who hit that “time to reintroduce myself to me” phase.",

I think it’s a bit too warm than what I was hoping for and I don’t like that it sort of has a red/mahogany undertone. I’m not sure if the lighting is making it look worse but I wish it looked more neutral. I do like the warmth but I also think I wish I got more of a cool/ashy chocolate.\n\nThe other 3 pics are my hair inspo and what I was hoping it would turn out like. I know it’s not that much difference but it’s really bothering me lol. I don’t really want to use any shampoos or get it toned in a salon as these results aren’t really permanent and need maintaining. How can I make my hair more like the other photos though? Would I need to get it dyed again completely? Will the red/mahogany tones eventually fade when I wash it more or get worse?\n\nI’m really stressed as I waiting a long time for my natural hair to grow out so I could dye it again and I spent so much on it not to be satisfied. Can anyone please recommend what I should do?",

Sorry for what's probably going to be a long post, but i kinda need help.\nVery first pic i was in my teens, no idea how to care for my hair AT ALL.\nI then got an undercut and let the top grow for a couple years, along with trying to experiment with appropriate products and routines.\nPic 2 and 3 was my longest, i decided to trim a bit and i think it kinda looks better and it's definitely more practical (4 it is still kinda wet, 7 is the shortest i had, styled with gel).\nIt seemd like results are always inconsistent, even tho my routine barely changed.\nCurrently im trying to get my undercat to reach the same length as my top, more volume should be a good idea, right?\nAnyway, about my routine, i wash my hair 3 times a week (4 tops).\nShampoo: i have to use kelual ds (or else my scalp acts up)\nConditioner: either pantene (i've seen no difference between the curly and straight hair one) or garnier fructis. While applied, i detangle usually by hand but using a comb yields same results i'd say.\nI then rinse and apply a styling cream (adorn or pantene)\nI try to always go for air-drying because even tho diffusing isn't that bad, it's still not as good.\nThank you everyone!\n\n",

However I don’t think it’s helping? I’ve kept this routine up for at least 2 months now. My forehead still has that grainy texture. The bumps do not itch though, but I’ve read that fungal acne doesn’t necessarily itch. Sebum/pus comes out when i squeeze some pimples, others just stay there as tiny bumps. Since I’ve been putting ketoconazole on my face thrice a week for at least 2 months I’m thinking it could be closed comedones instead which takes longer to cure, but then i live in a hot country and sweat a lot. Help and advice would be appreciated as I’m too broke to get a derm :)",

I have tried various products from TikTok and other sources, most of which only provided temporary relief. It wasn't till recently that I noticed that the same spots keep breaking out repeatedly in specific areas. Nevertheless, after a bit of trial and error, I managed to figure out what works and what does not. I have only recently discovered that cleaning with micellar water helps with my acne, along with the salicylic acid, which works temporarily but only mitigates my acne situation. However, in combination with these techniques, the areas I've treated this way have stopped breaking out (finally!). For a cleaner outline, refer below:\n\n**What's currently working:**\n\n* Use salicylic acid as a spot treatment on problem areas.\n* Cleansing those spots with micellar water.\n\n**I do have some concerns that I hope I can get an answer to:**\n\n* I have multiple problem areas across my face.\n* Treating each spot individually is taking a very long time.\n* Worried it'll be months/years before I'm fully clear and can start addressing scarring.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. Should I expand salicylic acid treatment to larger areas preventatively instead of spot-treating?\n2. What's a good daily routine to speed up this process?\n3. How can I treat active acne AND start addressing scars at the same time?\n\n**Current routine:**\n\n* Clean face with micellar water and apply salicylic acid to areas with recurring pimples 3 times a day.\n\n**Skin type:** oily and dry",

      "content": "Hi all, I've been a lurker on this sub for a long time and finally I'm caving. I'd love some advice and product recommendations for my skin right now 😭\n\nI've struggled with closed comedones for a long time all across my face but mostly on my cheeks and forehead. I have fairly dry skin, and while I do get lots of CCs I'm fortunate that my acne is pretty minimal and manageable. Since I've had years of trial and error using different products without much luck (and only one constant variable) I'm wondering if my moisturizer could be part of the problem. I was looking into some other threads on here about CeraVe adding to other people's closed comedone problem so I'm thinking that may be the culprit. I don't have a very high budget at the moment, so ideally I'd like to stay within the $10-$20 range if at all possible but I'm open to saving for something that would be worth it, especially as it's getting colder in my area.\n\nThis is my current routine with the products I use, let me know what you think!! Any help and advice is greatly welcome and appreciated!!!\n\nAM:\n\n- rinse with water\n\n- CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion\n\n- Trader Joe's Enrich face lotion SPF 15 over eyelids (other sunscreens have irritated the skin around my eyes)\n\n- Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Face Serum SPF 60 over entire face\n\n\nPM:\n\n- Wash with Dove sensitive bar soap\n\n- CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion\n\n- Differin Gel 0.1% (this is recent within the last 3-4 weeks, I was using 10% benzoyl peroxide for over a year with little to no results)",

After i get out the shower, i squeeze my hair dry and pat it with a normal towel and then spray on some lush supermilk, some oil (idk the name), and then scrunch in some macadamia garnier fructis hair cream. My waves don't really hold their shape well and get so frizzy and since my hair is kinda short (shoulder length), my hair is like super wide towards the bottom, but flat on my head??? \n\nAnyway, i've been thinking of getting a bonnet but upon looking at other people's recommendations, ive seen a lot of people using satin, and bamboo bonnets?? I thought they HAD to be silk for it to actually work and prevent frizz??? how does this work? What would you recommend to someone with hair like mine? \n\nANY tips on how to take care of my hair would be greatly appreciated!",

Sometimes I steal my Lil sis shampoo  hers is Biotera’s Ultra Moisturizing Shampoo and conditioner. I have a satin silk bonnet  and when I swim I use a micro fiber towel.\n\nAlso I take cold showers  :D\nCONTEXT:\n Since  my buzz cut phase  i let my hair grown and  its gotten longer pretty fast something i knew that would happen. My hair its pretty thin since my mom is black and im mixed (we puertorrican 😝) the very very curl parts are only are above my ear in both sides. The rest is very low on the curly scale is more wavy i think.\n\nProblem:\nMy problem is sometimes look pretty good and other time is like im a walking cloud. Hair gets pretty frizzy and my side curls look like a looney toons explosion. My scalp its prone to build up and gets flaky if scratched (I buy a shampoo when that happens but it comes back) Also I live in the Caribbean so the climate is pretty crazy or is intense heat or heavy rain.\n\n\nWhat i need: I need you guys to recomend me shampoos and conditioner and any hair products to use. Im not a routine person but I can try😭. Also   any drugstore/affordable shampoo would do since im a college student and buying too expensive stuff might break me 🤣\n\nI feel like I have to get hydrating shampoo and conditioner  or anything that is water based?? Not to heavy since i build up a lot in my hair\n\n\nSorry for the long text and errors since English is not my main language I'll leave some photos of myself  for extra help thx you guys for your help &lt;3\n",

      "content": "Obviously one of the most exciting treatments regarding hair loss. My chemist friend told me that realistically, as long as the hair is still there, PP405 should be able to make it thick and terminal again, maybe even by the first hair cycle. This is unlike minoxidil or fin which will maintain or slightly improve thickness, this can return juvenile thickness. Just want to know if this is true, and if this really can save people far down the line. At which point on the NW scale will it be ineffective, I am guessing anything after a NW4, but people seem to think that it can give you a full thick head of hair if you are NW3 or below. I don't understand the mechanism by which it works, but feel that is too goof to be true.",

It improves for a bit, and then right before my period, it flares up again—getting red, inflamed, and textured all over. It feels like a never-ending cycle.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar? Could this be purging, hormonal, or barrier-related?
