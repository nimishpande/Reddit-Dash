      "content": "In case you are thinking of giving up (because I was SO close to that at many points over the past 2 years) please don't! \n\nI grew up in the 90s before anyone knew how to properly care of curly hair, and I'm also Korean so I resented the fact that my hair was not slick, shiny, and straight like the other Korean girls I knew.  My mom used to scrunch my hair with mousse and air dry and send me to school with big, frizzy, triangle hair.  I hated it.  So in high school I started flat ironing my hair straight and also had various relaxing treatments done over the years. My hair was always in a state of incredible heat damage and I didn't even realize how bad it was. \n\nAny attempts in my pre-curly era to wear my hair naturally ended in huge fails because of the heat damage, lack of a good curly cut, and lack of proper know-how for product applications and styling techniques. I had lost hope I'd ever be able to figure it out. \n\n2 years ago something snapped and I decided to finally REALLY go for it.  I stopped flat ironing my hair completely. Cold turkey. At first it was bad. Really bad. As my new growth came in I had 2 vastly different textures and it looked awful. I had no clue how to apply products correctly for my hair texture. Every single wash day was a new trial and error. But I stuck it out. \n\nThis past January I got a good curly haircut and removed ALL of the heat damaged length.  They cut off about 10 inches. After that the remaining hair became SO curly. I was shocked. What I thought was more of a crimpy curl pattern had turned into actual tight ringlet curls.\n\nMy dream is to have long hair again but this time with curls. Now for the first time in my life I feel confident that I can actually get there and am so happy I stuck it out to this point and excited for the future. It's not perfect and I'm still learning more all the time but looking back I'm happy I didn't give up early on when it was so tempting to do so. I usually don't post anything online but I so badly wanted all the curlies out there who are thinking of giving up to know that you are not alone, and it will be SO worth it in the end. \n\npic 1 - Aug 2023 - the day I decided to go for it!\n\npic 2 - Mar 2024 - new growth with more curly texture\n\npic 3&amp;4 - Nov 2024 - new growth continues\n\npic 5 - Jan 2025 - after big curly cut\n\npic 6 - Jul 2025 - growing out, curls galore!\n\npic 7 - Sep 2025 - most recent progress\n\n\n\nCurrent products I use:\n\nCurlsmith Essential Moisture Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, Curl Reset Detox Shampoo, Double Cream Deep Quencher, Weightless Air Dry Cream, Hold Me Softly Style Balm, Curl Defining Souffle, Bonding Oil.\\* \n\n\\*I really think that the styling technique matters MUCH more than the specific product used, and while I like Curlsmith I'm sure I would get similar results with many other product brands and types.  \n\nRoutine:\n\nI alternate using the moisture shampoo and detox shampoo each wash, which is typically about every 5 days.  Out of the shower while soaking wet I put in a little air dry cream and then the style balm I brush in sections so that product is evenly distributed.  Then in small sections I apply the curl souffle with a bounce curl brush.  I plop for a few minutes then diffuse until I get tired or run out of time (usually 15 minutes) and let it air dry the rest.  Once completely dry and crunchy I scrunch out the crunch with the bonding oil. ",

      "content": "Hello, I just joined and this is my first time posting on here, so sorry if it seems like a silly question or this has been discussed previously. \n\n I was wondering about the science behind expensive hairdryers like like the Dyson Supersonic, or Shark Speed Style, and how they might differ from more reasonably priced alternatives such as the Laifen Swift, as they make a lot of the same claims, or the Panasonic EH-NA65 Nanoe. They all basically claim that they will dry your hair faster, at a lower temperature, and prevent or minimise damage through some kind of proprietary technology. But I wanted to ask, what is the science behind these claims, if any? What characteristics should someone actually be looking for, if they want to minimise/prevent damage? I hope I'm making sense.\n\n For instance, the Laifen Swift is supposed to have '100 times/s Smart Temperature Control' while some of their other models only claim to have '50 times/s Smart Temperature Control', and the Panasonic EH-NA65 doesn't have this feature at all, but they do claim to have 'nanoe™ technology'. So what is the science behind these claims, if any? Additionally, what other specs should people look at (e.g. wattage, RPM, airspeed, etc.) if their main concern is avoiding damage?\n\n Just to be clear, I'm not trying to ask about a specific product, these are just examples, but about the technology/specs more generally, and which characteristics a hair dryer should actually have, scientifically speaking, to be able to claim that it can minimise/prevent damage (if that is even possible).",

Between work, parenting, and trying to stay sane, I haven’t really thought about how I present myself beyond “clean and Zoom-ready.”\n\nBut now that I have a little breathing room, I want to feel like myself again, not just “the mom in a hoodie who used to be put-together.” I don’t want a full glam look, just a polished, natural routine that makes me feel awake and confident on normal days (and maybe during interviews).\n\nHere’s where I’m lost:\n\n* I never figured out my undertone. Every foundation either oxidizes or looks flat.\n* Lip colors always seem too much or too dull.\n* I’ve had makeup done for weddings, but it’s always heavy. I want to learn my face, not the bridal version of it.\n\nHas anyone ever gone to a pro just to find their “look”? Like a makeup lesson, not an event? Was it worth it? Or is this something I can figure out with YouTube and a good mirror?\n\nWould love recs from anyone who hit that “time to reintroduce myself to me” phase.",

(topical Fin every 2 days as my derm suggested it would have the same impact as every day).\n\nApprox 3 years Min, 2 years topical Finasteride - but I'm not sure what I should be expecting.\n\nI previously tried oral Finasteride, but believed I got sides about a month into it, with painful armpits, and extremely sore/itchy nipples.\n\nI recently saw my derm again, and he suggested I just stick with what I have been doing. However, I said I was not satisfied with where this has gotten me, and we agreed on increasing the topical finasteride from 0.1% to 0.25% concentration.\n\nI believe I still have mild gyno, (even before hairloss) and did not want to worsen it, so my dermatologist recommended me to switch to topical Fin, once every 2 days instead.\n\nI put the topical Finasteride very liberally on my head, and don't really measure how much I use as long as I cover all the regions thoroughly. I still shed a lot everyday. Never saw an increase in shedding at the start of using Fin, rather just the consistent shedding i've been experiencing since I started losing hair.\n\n\n\nWhat should I be doing in this position? I'm desperately wanting to regrow my hairline and what I have lost. Must I change back to oral finasteride to achieve maximum results? Would I need to microneedle, etc? Or am I not using the topical products efficiently enough?\n\nI've used the products for a while now - so it probably isn't a case of \"not using it long enough\". \n\nSo maybe just keep doing what my doctor has suggested? Their name has appeared quite a few times on this sub, so I know they are reputable and trusted.\n\nAny general advice from reddit? How can I regrow my hair?",

I think it’s a bit too warm than what I was hoping for and I don’t like that it sort of has a red/mahogany undertone. I’m not sure if the lighting is making it look worse but I wish it looked more neutral. I do like the warmth but I also think I wish I got more of a cool/ashy chocolate.\n\nThe other 3 pics are my hair inspo and what I was hoping it would turn out like. I know it’s not that much difference but it’s really bothering me lol. I don’t really want to use any shampoos or get it toned in a salon as these results aren’t really permanent and need maintaining. How can I make my hair more like the other photos though? Would I need to get it dyed again completely? Will the red/mahogany tones eventually fade when I wash it more or get worse?\n\nI’m really stressed as I waiting a long time for my natural hair to grow out so I could dye it again and I spent so much on it not to be satisfied. Can anyone please recommend what I should do?",

My chemist friend told me that realistically, as long as the hair is still there, PP405 should be able to make it thick and terminal again, maybe even by the first hair cycle. This is unlike minoxidil or fin which will maintain or slightly improve thickness, this can return juvenile thickness. Just want to know if this is true, and if this really can save people far down the line. At which point on the NW scale will it be ineffective, I am guessing anything after a NW4, but people seem to think that it can give you a full thick head of hair if you are NW3 or below. I don't understand the mechanism by which it works, but feel that is too goof to be true.",

      "content": "Hi! I am a 26F and have maintained pretty clear skin since entering my 20s. However, in the last 3-4 months i have noticed a big difference in the amount of texture and acne i am getting on specifically the right side of my face. I am a side sleeper and usually sleep on my left side so doubt that’s the culprit. I also don’t talk on the phone normally with the phone against y cheek so i doubt that as well. My skin care routine consists of in the morning i do a cleanse (vanicream gentle cleanser) and toner flooding (1. well licorice ph balanacing toner, ma:nyo bifidia biome ampoule toner, and either the pca skin hydrating toner or the tirtir milk skin toner) and then a vitamin c (eminence citrus and kale vitamin c serum) and a moisturizer (vanicream daily moisturizer) and sunscreen (beauty of joseon relief sun). At night I do basically the same thing but no sunscreen and double cleanse and use the caudalie revertrol lift as a retinol alternative in place of vitamin c. I also got microneedling done a month  ago to help with this texture and it made me purge at first, some spots won’t budge from that. However it eventually cleared a lot of the smaller texture but it seems to have all now come back. Please help :)\n\n\nEdit: I also live in an area that has harder water, so I have experienced some build up in my hair where it feels greasy after washing but then my scalp will also flake…wondering if that plays a factor at all",

      "content": "Hi all! About 2 months ago, I transitioned away from all skincare products (except nightly face wash/morning sunscreen) and used metro cream to clear up what was likely a perioral dermatitis flare up around my nose and mouth. I had been using tretinoin since January, and slowly built up a nice tolerance &amp; routine of using tretinoin every night (from 3x weekly, to every other day, to every day over the course of a month or two). I loved what it was doing for my skin, and was pretty bummed having to stop tretinoin and all other skincare in August to clear up this rash!\n\nI’m not positive what caused the flare up, and I’ve read it can often be quite random and idiopathic. However, I suspect it may have been my overuse of occlusives (specifically layers of aquaphor) around my nose and mouth area because these areas were most sensitive/prone to dryness from tretinoin. I also would do the sandwich method with a pretty thick moisturizer (La Roche Posay Triple Repair).\n\nI’ve now finished up my course of metrodinazole, and my dermatologist gave me the clear to start back up on tretinoin. She recommended using simple moisturizerizers like Cera Ve &amp; Vanicream, but I’m worried about my skin being crazy dry, or any product causing a flare up again.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience or insight on this? I’d appreciate any tips or advice on a new routine. Thanks!",

Sorry for what's probably going to be a long post, but i kinda need help.\nVery first pic i was in my teens, no idea how to care for my hair AT ALL.\nI then got an undercut and let the top grow for a couple years, along with trying to experiment with appropriate products and routines.\nPic 2 and 3 was my longest, i decided to trim a bit and i think it kinda looks better and it's definitely more practical (4 it is still kinda wet, 7 is the shortest i had, styled with gel).\nIt seemd like results are always inconsistent, even tho my routine barely changed.\nCurrently im trying to get my undercat to reach the same length as my top, more volume should be a good idea, right?\nAnyway, about my routine, i wash my hair 3 times a week (4 tops).\nShampoo: i have to use kelual ds (or else my scalp acts up)\nConditioner: either pantene (i've seen no difference between the curly and straight hair one) or garnier fructis. While applied, i detangle usually by hand but using a comb yields same results i'd say.\nI then rinse and apply a styling cream (adorn or pantene)\nI try to always go for air-drying because even tho diffusing isn't that bad, it's still not as good.\nThank you everyone!\n\n",

Every night, or just a few times a week?\n\t•\tDid you experience stinging or purging, and if so, how long did it last?\n\t•\tHow long do you usually wait between applying Azelaic Acid and your moisturizer?\n\nMy goal is to calm mild breakouts, help with clogged pores, and especially fade PIE over time — but I want to start in a smart, gentle way so I don’t overwhelm my skin.\n\nWould love to hear your routines, tips, and timelines 🙏",

Though after this summer vacation, I’ve started running a lot, and my acne has come back: more deep cysts along my jawline, mostly chin, and cheeks, though mostly on the right side of my face.\n\nTherefore I’ve been wondering if the increased cardio has been the cause of my acne, maybe because of more testosterone?

I have also gained a few kgs. My skincare includes, minimalist salicylic acid facewash, followed by foxtale niacinamide + azelaic acid serum then minimalist light fluid sunscreen. At the night, I double cleanse and do the same steps and use Minimalist Marula oil moisturizer and skip sunscreen.

Sometimes I steal my Lil sis shampoo  hers is Biotera’s Ultra Moisturizing Shampoo and conditioner. I have a satin silk bonnet  and when I swim I use a micro fiber towel.\n\nAlso I take cold showers  :D\nCONTEXT:\n Since  my buzz cut phase  i let my hair grown and  its gotten longer pretty fast something i knew that would happen. My hair its pretty thin since my mom is black and im mixed (we puertorrican 😝) the very very curl parts are only are above my ear in both sides. The rest is very low on the curly scale is more wavy i think.\n\nProblem:\nMy problem is sometimes look pretty good and other time is like im a walking cloud. Hair gets pretty frizzy and my side curls look like a looney toons explosion. My scalp its prone to build up and gets flaky if scratched (I buy a shampoo when that happens but it comes back) Also I live in the Caribbean so the climate is pretty crazy or is intense heat or heavy rain.\n\n\nWhat i need: I need you guys to recomend me shampoos and conditioner and any hair products to use. Im not a routine person but I can try😭. Also   any drugstore/affordable shampoo would do since im a college student and buying too expensive stuff might break me 🤣\n\nI feel like I have to get hydrating shampoo and conditioner  or anything that is water based?? Not to heavy since i build up a lot in my hair\n\n\nSorry for the long text and errors since English is not my main language I'll leave some photos of myself  for extra help thx you guys for your help &lt;3\n",

After i get out the shower, i squeeze my hair dry and pat it with a normal towel and then spray on some lush supermilk, some oil (idk the name), and then scrunch in some macadamia garnier fructis hair cream. My waves don't really hold their shape well and get so frizzy and since my hair is kinda short (shoulder length), my hair is like super wide towards the bottom, but flat on my head??? \n\nAnyway, i've been thinking of getting a bonnet but upon looking at other people's recommendations, ive seen a lot of people using satin, and bamboo bonnets?? I thought they HAD to be silk for it to actually work and prevent frizz??? how does this work? What would you recommend to someone with hair like mine? \n\nANY tips on how to take care of my hair would be greatly appreciated!",
