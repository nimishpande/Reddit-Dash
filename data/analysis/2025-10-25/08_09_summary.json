I remember i was on a solo trip to goa and i would wake up with hundreds of hair strands near my dorm bed. \nIts been 4 months \nThis is all i did\n\nInitially i started using oil but then I remembered once a dermat told me that when your roots are weak … oiling is the worst thing you can do to your hair.\n\nSo i didn’t really stop oiling i just oiled once a month\nI also used minimalist hair actives for a month. I still have some of it left… its good i use it once in a while.\n\n What actually helped? \nInitially this hair active serum helped me\nThen i switched to DIY rosemary spray … nothing fancy just boil some rosemary (got it from blinkit under 30 rs) and some methi dana ( fenugreek seeds)… this literally lasted me for 3 months… i store it in a glass bottle in the fridge and keep transferring it to my small spray bottle\nI use it 3-4 times a day \nIt does not make your hair oily … infact it makes your scalp fresh and less itchy\nYou have to massage your hair a little everytime you apply it ( if your hair is too brittle, i suggest don’t massage with pressure… just use your fingertips)\n\nI switched my pillowcase to a satin pillowcase\nI travel quite often so i have this satin haircover that i use everynight.\nTie your hair before sleeping.\n\nP.S. give yourself atleast 2 months to see a noticeable difference \n\nP.S 2 - i know this is not a 180 degrees result but its way better than the second picture. \n1st picture was clicked on diwali ( i straightened my hair) \n2nd was taken in july 1st week",

      "content": "My 6 month journey. April 2025 - October 2025.\n\nMale 47. Had full head of hair up until 41-42 when i started to notice thinning (im sure the thinning started long before but that's when it started to be noticeable), but was slight so i just put it down to aging. \n\nThe thinning accelerated from 44. Again, put it down to aging and accepted it. Then early 2025 at 46, I stumbled on this community and started my research.\n\nStarted treatment in early April 2025 (first pic).. second pic was taken Thursday 23 October. Both with dry hair and no products. My hair \"was\" naturally shinny before treatment hence why first pic looks a bit moist.\n\nMy routine: Just the basics! - no fancy shampoos, washes, honey or herbal shit that gets thrown around on here.\n\n1mg oral Fin and 5mg oral Min (morning)\n\n1ml 5% topical Min (evenings)\n\nDerm stamp weekly. 1mm at temples and hairline, 1.5-1.7mm rest of scalp where hair is thicker. Then apply the Min directly after stamping. I get no irritation doing this, but it may be different for everyone.\n\nLifestyle - Family man, gym 3-4 time per week, fit/athletic build, ordinary diet. No real change in this for the last 10 years.\n\nResults - well i think the pics show how that's going. I'd say I've regained about 70-75% of where i was in my early 40's before i noticed the thinning. Temples and hairline have recovered well. Crown has been slower to come beck but there is definitely progress. Overall I'm very pleased.\n\nSides - i haven't experienced any of the unmanageable negative sides some on here have experienced. Blood work prior and during treatment shows I'm within the normal ranges for everything. in fact, the most recent bloodwork showed a reduction of prostate cancer indicators, which i assume due to the Fin being originally a prostrate med. \n\nFurther.. i feel like i don't have to take a piss as often now. This is really evident at night. I would wake normally 2 times a night to take a piss... but in recent months.. its only been once and nights where i haven't needed wake is becoming more and more frequent!\n\n\\- no issues with sex life, if anything its been even more active.\n\n\\- As min is a vasodilator has caused some nasal congestion as I have narrow passages, but easily fixed with nasal sprays and decongestant meds when needed.... but on the flip side it has made me super vascular and look super jacked at the gym with a full pump.\n\n\\- The topical Min has definitely changed the texture of my hair, Its much coarse and dry. But im ok with this.\n\nHoping the regrowth gains continue on and excited to see where I'll be at the 12-month point, but im stoked with the result thus far and thankful i found this community when i did.\n\n  \n",

My past routine was mielle’s pomegranate and honey detangling and moisturizing shampoo with the mielle P&amp;H leave in conditioner which both didnt really change the results of my hair texture, or curls. Anyways, the first photo is a year or two before having my son, the second photo is 8 months into my pregnancy and the third photo is from today. My curls have completely disappeared, from what I’ve seen IF they were to come back they should have by now since my son will be two in December. My question is, is there quite literally any possibility that I can get my curls back or is it completely done for? I know it’s the hormones that changed the texture but has anyone else has this happen and it came back later than usual? I never straightened my hair ever because I loved my curls. I would take care of them so well and make sure my hair was moisturized and well kept as to not damage my curls. So for this to happen due to friggin hormones kills me and I think about it multiple times a week if not a day since it’s happened. I felt like I lost a part of myself :,( thanks in advance.",

My current routine is like:\n\n1. Redken acidic bonding curls shampoo and conditioner. Sometimes I use Pantene shampoo and conditioner\n2. Bounce curl hair cream and pattern curl gel\n3. I normally diffuse my hair. I make sure when putting product in my hair it’s doused with water and is like that when it’s time to diffuse. Straight out the shower though (like that time between hopping out and going to diffuse) it kind of just dries up a bit and looks frizzy even when it’s wet\n\nAny advice on what I can do? Is this a protein overload? \n",

      "content": "I recently bought a bonnet to protect my hair while sleeping, while it does keep my hair about equally voluminous; it doesn't do much to actually protect my curls themselves from getting crushed/straightened. My current routine is:\n- Gather all my hair and put it in a ponytail at the front of my head\n- Fold my hair on itself to make a bun\n- Put bonnet on\n- Put rubber band over bonnet to keep it in place. (This doesn't touch my hair)\n\nMy main idea for what could be going wrong would be the size of the bonnet. I think it's made for shorter hair than mine (about shoulder length) so the top of it presses against the bun that I have. It was also pretty cheap so it's also possible that the material is the issue, it's satin but probably isn't the highest quality. \n\nAnother thought would be the scrunchie I use, it's not silk or satin and is kind of tight. Although it mainly goes around the top of my hair, which is mainly straighter due to my hair pattern. Thoughts/suggestions?",

I currently have dry patches on my face that popped up as soon as the temps changed. I'm looking for kind of a heavy moisturizer to help give the skin on my face, neck, and chest more moisture. I DO apply a thin layer of Vaseline at night that helps a little bit, but I really need something that I can use during the day. I'm currently using Laneige Water Bank Gel Moisturizer and while I love it, it's just not enough for my skin in this weather. Please help! 🙏",
