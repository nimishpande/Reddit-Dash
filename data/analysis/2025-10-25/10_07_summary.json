      "title": "My 6 month journey thus far... 47yo Male.",
      "content": "My 6 month journey. April 2025 - October 2025.\n\nMale 47. Had full head of hair up until 41-42 when i started to notice thinning (im sure the thinning started long before but that's when it started to be noticeable), but was slight so i just put it down to aging. \n\nThe thinning accelerated from 44. Again, put it down to aging and accepted it. Then early 2025 at 46, I stumbled on this community and started my research.\n\nStarted treatment in early April 2025 (first pic).. second pic was taken Thursday 23 October. Both with dry hair and no products. My hair \"was\" naturally shinny before treatment hence why first pic looks a bit moist.\n\nMy routine: Just the basics! - no fancy shampoos, washes, honey or herbal shit that gets thrown around on here.\n\n1mg oral Fin and 5mg oral Min (morning)\n\n1ml 5% topical Min (evenings)\n\nDerm stamp weekly. 1mm at temples and hairline, 1.5-1.7mm rest of scalp where hair is thicker. Then apply the Min directly after stamping. I get no irritation doing this, but it may be different for everyone.\n\nLifestyle - Family man, gym 3-4 time per week, fit/athletic build, ordinary diet. No real change in this for the last 10 years.\n\nResults - well i think the pics show how that's going. I'd say I've regained about 70-75% of where i was in my early 40's before i noticed the thinning. Temples and hairline have recovered well. Crown has been slower to come beck but there is definitely progress. Overall I'm very pleased.\n\nSides - i haven't experienced any of the unmanageable negative sides some on here have experienced. Blood work prior and during treatment shows I'm within the normal ranges for everything. in fact, the most recent bloodwork showed a reduction of prostate cancer indicators, which i assume due to the Fin being originally a prostrate med. \n\nFurther.. i feel like i don't have to take a piss as often now. This is really evident at night. I would wake normally 2 times a night to take a piss... but in recent months.. its only been once and nights where i haven't needed wake is becoming more and more frequent!\n\n\\- no issues with sex life, if anything its been even more active.\n\n\\- As min is a vasodilator has caused some nasal congestion as I have narrow passages, but easily fixed with nasal sprays and decongestant meds when needed.... but on the flip side it has made me super vascular and look super jacked at the gym with a full pump.\n\n\\- The topical Min has definitely changed the texture of my hair, Its much coarse and dry. But im ok with this.\n\nHoping the regrowth gains continue on and excited to see where I'll be at the 12-month point, but im stoked with the result thus far and thankful i found this community when i did.\n\n  \n",

My current routine is shampooing with tee tree occasionally and regularly pureology nanoworks gold, conditioner every other time after washing is amika volume and thickening conditioner. My past routine was mielle’s pomegranate and honey detangling and moisturizing shampoo with the mielle P&amp;H leave in conditioner which both didnt really change the results of my hair texture, or curls. Anyways, the first photo is a year or two before having my son, the second photo is 8 months into my pregnancy and the third photo is from today. My curls have completely disappeared, from what I’ve seen IF they were to come back they should have by now since my son will be two in December. My question is, is there quite literally any possibility that I can get my curls back or is it completely done for? I know it’s the hormones that changed the texture but has anyone else has this happen and it came back later than usual? I never straightened my hair ever because I loved my curls. I would take care of them so well and make sure my hair was moisturized and well kept as to not damage my curls. So for this to happen due to friggin hormones kills me and I think about it multiple times a week if not a day since it’s happened. I felt like I lost a part of myself :,( thanks in advance.",

      "content": "I have been using Minimalist Retinal 0.1% for the last 1 year now. I tolerate it pretty well. Never experienced flaking. I also graduated to applying it under my eyes (which I was very scared about initially). I noticed results as well, skin looks smooth and glowy. Have been getting compliments lately. Now that I am near the end of my bottle, I am contemplating what should I buy next. Here are my options:\n\n1. Celimax retinal 0.1%: I have been seeing this everywhere. I know not all products are made equal so I am wondering if I am missing out on something. The con is obviously that I am staying with the same strength and hence won't see incremental results\n\n2. The ordinary retinal 0.2% emulsion: The only stronger retinal I see in the market. Not as popular as Celimax but higher strength. I would likely see better results. \n\nSo yeah, I have some fomo. But I am also confused about how to progress on Retinal. When am I supposed to move to higher strength? What happens after I use retinal 0.2% for a year? Do I settle on one strength? Do I keep moving but that also must have some limit?",

      "content": "Hi! I started using 2% AA serum from Minamalist around a month ago, but the past two weeks are when I've been consistent with AM/PM skincare. \n\nI started using it to reduce hyperpigmentation due to a hormonal acne flare-up on my skin. My skin type is mostly combination/dry, sensitive and acne-prone. \n\nThis serum has worked wonders with reducing hyperpigmentation with acne scars and I'm so grateful for it.\n\nThe only downsides I've had to this is the skin dryness. I've read that the HA in the serum craves moisture and since the weather is getting drier with winter on the way, it's been stripping my skin of moisture in areas of high pigmentation. This was mostly around my mouth, undereyes and sideburns. \n\nAM:\n- Neutrogena Lime &amp; Aloe Vera Oil Balancing Cleanser \n- Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum\n- Johnson's Face &amp; Body Lotion\n- Bioré Sunscreen (I tend to skip this because I'm usually indoors, in a very dark room)\n\nPM:\n- Neutrogena Lime &amp; Aloe Vera Cleanser\n- Johnson's Face &amp; Body Lotion\n\nNOTE: I'm definitely looking to switch to a lighter, unscented moisturiser like Hymos to repair my skin barrier. The one I use right now has alcohol and light scents, and with combination skin, it irritates it a bunch.\n\nI hope you've all had some great progress using this as well! This is the first time I've added a serum into my routine and I'm thrilled that I didn't suffer through any weird side effects! (touchwood) 🤞\n\n",
