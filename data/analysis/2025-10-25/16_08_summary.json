      "content": "Hello people. First time in this subreddit so bear with me. \nI have pretty curly hair but it’s also fairly thin. It has taken some time for me to learn how to handle it. I’ve come from brushing it dry, to knowing I need to style it wet, to getting my first curly brush and getting rid of the middle part. And on some days it does look really good (last two pictures). But those days are mostly when I use absolutely no product and let it air dry. Which generally works fine but it means I have to wash (not with shampoo but just drench it) every single day to style it because the curls don’t hold over night. \n\nI’ve been pretty fine with it because nothing else has ever worked for me but it’s exhausting, difficult and how I’ve recently learned not good to style and drench your hair every day? So I wanted to try and find a way to get long lasting curls. I wear a bonnet at night but without some gel there’s absolutely no way my curls will last over night. However if I use any product my hair look so incredibly thin. I tried an entire routine today with curl cream and curl gel and I diffused it afterwards. But while crunching out the scrunch made my hair all pretty and soft, the product makes my hair look really thin (see pictures). \n\nWhat should I do different? Is there something I can try (especially on a budget)? And please tell me if there is any way to get thicker and longer hair because I hate having thin curls so much and I’m scared it will get worse. \n\nThank you all in advance! ",

      "content": "Hi! I started using 2% AA serum from Minamalist around a month ago, but the past two weeks are when I've been consistent with AM/PM skincare. \n\nI started using it to reduce hyperpigmentation due to a hormonal acne flare-up on my skin. My skin type is mostly combination/dry, sensitive and acne-prone. \n\nThis serum has worked wonders with reducing hyperpigmentation with acne scars and I'm so grateful for it.\n\nThe only downsides I've had to this is the skin dryness. I've read that the HA in the serum craves moisture and since the weather is getting drier with winter on the way, it's been stripping my skin of moisture in areas of high pigmentation. This was mostly around my mouth, undereyes and sideburns. \n\nAM:\n- Neutrogena Lime &amp; Aloe Vera Oil Balancing Cleanser \n- Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum\n- Johnson's Face &amp; Body Lotion\n- Bioré Sunscreen (I tend to skip this because I'm usually indoors, in a very dark room)\n\nPM:\n- Neutrogena Lime &amp; Aloe Vera Cleanser\n- Johnson's Face &amp; Body Lotion\n\nNOTE: I'm definitely looking to switch to a lighter, unscented moisturiser like Hymos to repair my skin barrier. The one I use right now has alcohol and light scents, and with combination skin, it irritates it a bunch.\n\nI hope you've all had some great progress using this as well! This is the first time I've added a serum into my routine and I'm thrilled that I didn't suffer through any weird side effects! (touchwood) 🤞\n\n",

I’ve never gifted her branded makeup before so I’m both excited and a bit nervous.\n\nShe already has a few nice things from Dior and Huda Beauty, so I tried to pick products she’d actually use and enjoy. I’ve shared a picture of what’s in my cart right now but I still feel like something’s missing.\n\nAny ideas on what else I could add to make it feel more special or complete? Also not sure how to pack it….should I go with a gift box, a makeup pouch, or something more personal?\n\nWould love to hear your suggestions and ideas. ❤️",

Also there is probably a better way to achieve what I’m doing, so if you have any tips please share! \n\n1) Cleanse with either Maria Nila Coils &amp; Curls Co-Wash or DevaCurl No-Poo Original. \n2) Gently towel-press dry with DevaCurl towel\n3) Spray some kind of sea salt spray…Maria Nila Ocean Spray is probably my favorite, but I’ve tried lots that work similarly. Sometimes I use a gel instead during this step, but usually it’s the spray. \n4) Usually on my wash days (I typically do it in the evening), that’s it for my routine. I let it air dry, and then go to bed, and when I wake up in the morning it usually looks crazy/terrible 😆. I’ve tried a silk bonnet, but so far I haven’t found one that is comfortable! \n5) In the morning, if it’s just been freshly washed the night before, I’ll sprinkle Sexy Hair Powder Play around and then spray all around with hairspray. (Yes, I put the products on dry, crazy morning hair, before the next step). If not freshly washed, skip this step. \n6) With my curly hair towel handy, I tip my head into my bathroom sink, turn on the water, and soak all of my hair by cupping water in my hand and pressing it to my head, if that makes sense…this helps re-form the curls. \n7) Gently towel-press hair dry. \n8) I let it air dry while making breakfast for the kids and getting them ready for the day. \n9) Diffuse on hot low (my diffuser is from DevaCurl and I love it) until it’s dry. \n10) Sprinkle Powder Play, spray again with hairspray. Sometimes I’ll diffuse again after hairspray. \n11) Gently rub a flat palm on the crunchy areas to break up the cast. Extra Powder Play and/or hairspray in areas if needed, to give extra hold/height/interest for that “messy” look. \n\nI hope that all makes sense! My hair probably looks best on days 3-5 post-wash. It gets easier to style as a bit more product builds up from previous days. \n\nIt’s been a fun year with my curls…I wore my hair long, bleach blonde, and straight for decades, and last November I shaved it all off. I’ll include photos of now and before. ☺️💛",

I’ve been doing my best but my curls are very frizzy, don’t hold or last well, and I don’t know what to change. I feel so lost after doing research on the best products and routines, there are so many options and expensive products. \n\nAll images show my day 1 hair, it’s not as curly as it could be -I think it’s not weighed down enough. The underside didn’t curl almost at all. I used the products shown in last picture and a microfiber hair wrap to dry mostly, then air dry overnight (“silk” pillowcase). \n\nAnyone have ideas on a better routine or better products to help?

I just kept using it without any real reason.Recently, I read about using glycerin on the skin and decided to give it a try and my skin loved it!\n\nBought the atomiser from Blinkit and got glycerin and distilled water from a local pharmacy. Glycerin needs to be diluted, otherwise it can make your skin feel even drier. I diluted it in about 1:8 ratio (glycerin : distilled water)\n\nThe glycerin bottle cost me around 50, and the distilled water packets were rs.3 each. I spray it on my face when it’s slightly damp after cleansing, then follow up with a moisturizer. I’ve been loving it lately, it’s super hydrating and very budget friendly!",

My mom cared of my hair of my childhood, and she did an amazing job! no iron, no dryer, always with low ponytails… fr, the best job.\n\nWhen I was 12, i did a big chop, and I hated it. I growed my hair without going to the stylist til my 17’s (1rst photo). That was my best curly era, long, healthy… i loved it and i felt so proud of my hair.\n\nThen, I went to uni and I did a mini-balayage, still having amazing hair! but felt it a bit shorter (?) idk why! then I started to use dryers, maximum heat and air (yeah, i know, curly terrorism.) (2nd photo)\n\nThen, i realised that all that heat was not good for my hair, and i decided to be more responsable of it and take care. AND NOW I’VE THE WORST HAIR EVER! dry, feels so dead, always puffy when i go out… HORRIBLE. I don’t feel secure with it, and i start to feel so ugly and insecure.\n\nMy routine has been always the same:\n\n- Shampoo and conditioner = (i’ve been using fructis all my life, now i’m with pantene curly.)\n\n-Gel and mousse (I’m using the mercadona’s ones, my mom and I have used them since i can remember.)\n\n- Dry it with dyson (I bought it bc it’s supposed to be less harmful), medium heat medium air\n\nI remember that I always used to air dry my hair, but it took hours... I don't use oil after my routine because my hair gets really frizzy as soon as I step outside.\n\nI feel completely hopeless. I've tried sleeping with olive oil, making flaxseed gel and letting it sit, increasing the amount of water I drink...  Please, if someone knows how to help me, i’ll be so grateful!!!\n\nPd. Sorry for my english, i know that is not the best! hope someone can help me :(",

I've been washing in the morning and evening and applying Neutrogena hydra boost gel in the mornings after washing. \n\nMy skin so far feels much smoother, but I'm still breaking out a bit (not at inflamed as before starting the routine though), but my skin burns/stings for about 10 minutes after.

Still working on figuring out a routine, although I’m quite happy with where I am now at least on wash days (first picture).\n\nI don’t want to wash everyday and ideally also not have to completely re-wet everyday because I’m a lazy b**** 😅 when I simply try spraying it with some water, the definition is alright but I get a lot of frizz. If I try reapplying a bit of mousse on misted hair, it gets really stringy and unkempt looking. If I apply gel mixed with water on misted hair (as in the second picture), the result is the best so far, but still quite frizzy and chaotic looking especially on the top of my head. \n\nFiguring out porosity is difficult for me, I guess high porosity at least on the top, maybe medium for the rest? \n\nCurrent routine: \nWashing every second/third day with Balea Med Shampoo (german brand, nothing special just for sensitive scalp), conditioning with Being bye bye frizz, wet hair in T-shirt because I hate dripping, then Umberto Giannini Curl Foam, sometimes the Umberto Giannini Curl Jelly gel, too. Mainly hover diffuse until 80% dry. I don’t get a cast from these products. \nEvery second wash I also use the Being mega no-frizz mask before conditioning.\n\nAll tips are welcome, thank you 🙏 ",

I don’t have an even skintone on my face and I’m tired of it. I’d be grateful if someone suggests me how to remove tan pigmentation, melasma and acne. I did go to dermats, either it didn’t work for me or they’re super expensive.\nI don’t have a skincare routine, don’t know which brands to trust and what all ingredients i should use, as My face alone is 4 shades darker than my neck.

My current routine is shampooing with tee tree occasionally and regularly pureology nanoworks gold, conditioner every other time after washing is amika volume and thickening conditioner. My past routine was mielle’s pomegranate and honey detangling and moisturizing shampoo with the mielle P&amp;H leave in conditioner which both didnt really change the results of my hair texture, or curls. Anyways, the first photo is a year or two before having my son, the second photo is 8 months into my pregnancy and the third photo is from today. My curls have completely disappeared, from what I’ve seen IF they were to come back they should have by now since my son will be two in December. My question is, is there quite literally any possibility that I can get my curls back or is it completely done for? I know it’s the hormones that changed the texture but has anyone else has this happen and it came back later than usual? I never straightened my hair ever because I loved my curls. I would take care of them so well and make sure my hair was moisturized and well kept as to not damage my curls. So for this to happen due to friggin hormones kills me and I think about it multiple times a week if not a day since it’s happened. I felt like I lost a part of myself :,( thanks in advance.",

      "content": "I am getting a holiday gift for a child in child protective services through my local police station.  The child (12F) requested skincare items, specifically sunscreen, a dark spot corrector, a face mask and a texture corrector.  For the sunscreen, I will get her Trader Joe’s facial sunscreen (which I use personally, and love) but what should I do for the other items? She is pretty young so I’m hesitant to buy adult products for her. I would get her a gift certificate (which is also easier for me) but that assumes she has someone to take her to the store.\n\nDoes anyone have product recommendations for a dark spot corrector, a face mask and a texture corrector for a 12 year old?",

But I'm a total noob when it comes to hairstyles. How can I style it myself? I have a long bob, so about the same length as the lady's hair. \n\nMy guess is a round brush. But which one?",
