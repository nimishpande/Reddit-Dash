      "content": "I was asked in another sub to post my hair routine, so here it is! It‚Äôs a little wacky, so I‚Äôll try to make it make sense. Also there is probably a better way to achieve what I‚Äôm doing, so if you have any tips please share! \n\n1) Cleanse with either Maria Nila Coils &amp; Curls Co-Wash or DevaCurl No-Poo Original. \n2) Gently towel-press dry with DevaCurl towel\n3) Spray some kind of sea salt spray‚Ä¶Maria Nila Ocean Spray is probably my favorite, but I‚Äôve tried lots that work similarly. Sometimes I use a gel instead during this step, but usually it‚Äôs the spray. \n4) Usually on my wash days (I typically do it in the evening), that‚Äôs it for my routine. I let it air dry, and then go to bed, and when I wake up in the morning it usually looks crazy/terrible üòÜ. I‚Äôve tried a silk bonnet, but so far I haven‚Äôt found one that is comfortable! \n5) In the morning, if it‚Äôs just been freshly washed the night before, I‚Äôll sprinkle Sexy Hair Powder Play around and then spray all around with hairspray. (Yes, I put the products on dry, crazy morning hair, before the next step). If not freshly washed, skip this step. \n6) With my curly hair towel handy, I tip my head into my bathroom sink, turn on the water, and soak all of my hair by cupping water in my hand and pressing it to my head, if that makes sense‚Ä¶this helps re-form the curls. \n7) Gently towel-press hair dry. \n8) I let it air dry while making breakfast for the kids and getting them ready for the day. \n9) Diffuse on hot low (my diffuser is from DevaCurl and I love it) until it‚Äôs dry. \n10) Sprinkle Powder Play, spray again with hairspray. Sometimes I‚Äôll diffuse again after hairspray. \n11) Gently rub a flat palm on the crunchy areas to break up the cast. Extra Powder Play and/or hairspray in areas if needed, to give extra hold/height/interest for that ‚Äúmessy‚Äù look. \n\nI hope that all makes sense! My hair probably looks best on days 3-5 post-wash. It gets easier to style as a bit more product builds up from previous days. \n\nIt‚Äôs been a fun year with my curls‚Ä¶I wore my hair long, bleach blonde, and straight for decades, and last November I shaved it all off. I‚Äôll include photos of now and before. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíõ",

Glycerin needs to be diluted, otherwise it can make your skin feel even drier. I diluted it in about 1:8 ratio (glycerin : distilled water)\n\nThe glycerin bottle cost me around 50, and the distilled water packets were rs.3 each.

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n¬†\n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n¬†\n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n¬†\n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n¬†\n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n¬†\n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you‚Äôve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you¬†\n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

I‚Äôd say it is combination skin but not overly sensitive. I also have some sun spots (I wear sunscreen every day but we didn‚Äôt believe in sunscreen in the 80s ü™¶ so I think this is old damage). I had a hysterectomy a few years ago so not sure if I‚Äôm in menopause but there are other signs and I‚Äôm on transdermal estrogen, which has helped those symptoms a lot.\n\nI gave ChatGPT a list of products I already own, and it recommended a few more: the Paula‚Äôs phytoestrogen and the Good Molecules dark spot corrector. Everything else in the regimen is stuff I already own.\n\nChat has been unreliable in the past so looking for some human oversight! I‚Äôm open to product thoughts/recommendations, reasons why this regimen is faulty, what is good or should be replaced/reconsidered‚Ä¶ really anything. I‚Äôve generally been a low-maintenance girl blessed with young-looking skin but am willing to step it up to return it to its former glory (or as close as possible)!\n\nTIA for any help!\n\nPS-  I may add Vit C and/or an eye cream later (Olay retinol 24 hour eye cream was the recommendation).

My mom cared of my hair of my childhood, and she did an amazing job! no iron, no dryer, always with low ponytails‚Ä¶ fr, the best job.\n\nWhen I was 12, i did a big chop, and I hated it. I growed my hair without going to the stylist til my 17‚Äôs (1rst photo). That was my best curly era, long, healthy‚Ä¶ i loved it and i felt so proud of my hair.\n\nThen, I went to uni and I did a mini-balayage, still having amazing hair! but felt it a bit shorter (?) idk why! then I started to use dryers, maximum heat and air (yeah, i know, curly terrorism.) (2nd photo)\n\nThen, i realised that all that heat was not good for my hair, and i decided to be more responsable of it and take care. AND NOW I‚ÄôVE THE WORST HAIR EVER! dry, feels so dead, always puffy when i go out‚Ä¶ HORRIBLE. I don‚Äôt feel secure with it, and i start to feel so ugly and insecure.\n\nMy routine has been always the same:\n\n- Shampoo and conditioner = (i‚Äôve been using fructis all my life, now i‚Äôm with pantene curly.)\n\n-Gel and mousse (I‚Äôm using the mercadona‚Äôs ones, my mom and I have used them since i can remember.)\n\n- Dry it with dyson (I bought it bc it‚Äôs supposed to be less harmful), medium heat medium air\n\nI remember that I always used to air dry my hair, but it took hours... I don't use oil after my routine because my hair gets really frizzy as soon as I step outside.\n\nI feel completely hopeless. I've tried sleeping with olive oil, making flaxseed gel and letting it sit, increasing the amount of water I drink...  Please, if someone knows how to help me, i‚Äôll be so grateful!!!\n\nPd. Sorry for my english, i know that is not the best! hope someone can help me :(",
