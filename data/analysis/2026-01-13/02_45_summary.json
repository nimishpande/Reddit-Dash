In Feb 2025 I added oral min alongside the current medications. \n\nI decided to stop the topical usage of minoxidil and stick with only oral, hoping the switch would be fine. I made the transition gradually too, over the course of a few months.\n\nSadly to say, I’ve been shedding for over half a year nonstop and have lost all my hair. I keep losing hair every day. I know people say to give it time, but this 6+month shed hasn’t slowed down one bit, and I haven’t seen any crazy regrowth with oral min. I’ve literally had sheds and recovered from them in the amount of time I’m shedding right now.\n\nI’ve since started using topical minoxidil again, alongside both oral fin and min pills. \n\nAny comments or recommendations will be greatly appreciated, I’m basically starting over again. I’ll be using topical AND oral min, with oral fin.\n\n5% topical min, 0.5 oral fin, 2.5 oral min. Dosages have remained the same throughout the entire journey. Hopefully I can make another comeback.\n\nIn hindsight dropping topical minoxidil was definitely a dumb move, as I had great hair last summer. I only wanted to stop it because pills were easier. ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I do struggle a lot with blackheads, so I would love some recommendations for that issue!\n\nHowever, my skin has suddenly started breaking out and it's making me feel so down and insecure. The photos don't show much and the big spots have dried out but I have little bumps and also bigger spots. I have started going to the sauna at my gym for the last two weeks, not every day tho l've been about 4 times so far. And I know that when my boyf started the sauna his skin broke out but then settled as he went consistently. I do think it's a mix of the sauna and possible an early twenties hormonal change, but does anyone have any advice to help with my skin?\n\nThank you!!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

It looks fine for about a month but my hair grows so fast that my roots end up looking flat again, I find myself having to trim at home but there is only so much I can cut off. My hairstylist trims/reshapes every four months. I've tried root clips and foams, but neither give me a consistent or lasting lift. Root clips actually will slip out of my head when styling sometimes. \n\n\ncurrent routine for guidelines:\n\n1. clarify once every 3-5 days with ouai detox shampoo. apply leave-in conditioner as needed afterwards. \n\n2. Detangle, then define curls while wet. Seperate clumps.\n\n3. Microflop until damp, then apply mousse/foam (I alternate between NYM Curl Talk, Herbal Essence's Mousse, and Innersense I Create Lift)\n\n4. Diffuse upside down (kinda wanna stop doing this, it's hurting my back), incorporate root clips once 50% dry. Add a tiny bit of foam at the lengths for extra grit. \n\n5.

This time of year especially the sun is extremely brutal, so I try to sunblock a lot.\n\nNow my problems are that I sweat heaps meaning my sunblock doesn’t last that long, I’ve got quite fair skin so I have to re-apply a lot otherwise I get burnt easily. Paired with this I get quite dirty so I’m having to apply sunblock to a dirty face and I have it on my face all day.\n\nMy second problem is because of this my acne has gotten quite bad. I try and clean my face before each application but it doesn’t seem to help.\n\nI’m looking for suggestions on sunblocks that will last a while on my face and neck even while sweating. I’d also appreciate recommendations on face wipes I can use during the day before re-applying, as well as a good oil cleanser and secondary cleanser that will help properly clean my skin at the end of the day.\n\nIf anyone has any other tips, e.g exfoliating recommendations, that’d also be appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance",

In the meantime I always took care of it, tried products that would help me mantain it, but I didn't bother styling it. \nThis year I want to wear my hair down. I started the styling process but I noticed that my hair is much staighter at the top of my head than the end of my hair. I have a layered cut so in theory it should curl.\nI'm wondering if the years of bun mania might have ruined the curl pattern at the top of my hair. Does anyone else have any experience with this? Do you have any suggestions about fixing this issue?\n\nMy routine:\n- Brush before shower (I know it's not recommended, but brushing during shower made my hair worse imo)\n- Shampoo and conditioner: Amway's, for normal hair\n- Brush my hair again, after the first detangling, while it's wet\n- Section my hair and apply a light hold gel, I do not have the name for the brand unfortunately\n- Flip over my head and apply a foam from the same unknown brand\n- Dry it with semi warm setting\n\nMy curls most of the time look defined\n",

I'm envisioning an app that has a scanning option where you can scan you face for example and have any concerns identified ie. specific pimples, specific patches of hyperpigmentation, eczema etc. If anything is out of the ordinary, you will be ref'd to a dermatologist immediately; it could potentially even help with early serious skincare detections. It would then give you tailored treatments / how to apply them to treat those specific breakouts and accelerate your healing timeline. All of your scans are tracked and you can see pasts scans and get advice on what products, diet, lifestyle factors may be affecting your skin. You can also create a custom skincare budget and have products recommended to you that fit that budget. You can buy products directly through the app (maybe a discount?) and can also scan your existing products to see what works for you, how to use them and if anything is hazardous. There would also be a specialized ChatGPT for skincare in the app that you can ask any questions about your skin / general skincare. \n\nIt would be free to use with maybe a premium tier? Or completely free with monetization from in-app product purchases.\n\nWould you use it? Got any ideas? If I build an app like this, I wouldn’t want to do it without the input of the community.",

I like how my bangs look but is there a way i could get like framing pieces that look like that? Like since i have the bangs maybe theres not any hair to cut those but if i can then what is that? I don't really know how to search and if that haircut exists i want to see what it would look like. Im so sorry if this is against rules i just cant really find what it is and also if it's even possible bc of my bangs. And maybe it wouldn't even look good so idk. I know a lot of it is just like a different type of bang but maybe i could get it cut as like layers idk. Sorry if im bad at writing or asking",

But every time i do this my whole face, especially on my eyelids and around my eyes gets chapped and its extremely painful. Im applying several lotions to my face constantly to try to help. I do think it could maybe have something to do with my apartments heating system or just the cold air or something since i have never had any issue with my face drying out so much, even and i am using sucha small amount of the gel i feel like it cant just be that alone. But the only thing that seems to fix it is to stop using it, then i break out again.\n\n  \nCan anyone recommend me any other products they think would work in my scenario?\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I’ve never cut my hair in fear of ruining it so advice would be greatly appreciated \n\nThe first picture is my hair at the front. I usually have the hair past my ears at the front and all the rest at the back. The second picture is a rough sketch of how I kinda want it to look (though it doesn’t have to be perfect and can be longer, I just want that in the front and maybe thin/mini braids with the original length behind it)\n\nMy guess would be to make that diagonal cut (in red) and then shape it or free style (whatever it’s referred to as when you make sorta random cuts up into the end) but I’m not sure. Would it be better to do that while my hair is wet or dry? I also plan on dyeing it green if that makes any difference. Now that I’m looking at it, I suppose it would make more sense to diagonal cut at the opposite direction ",

I can also never seem to get both sides to have good looking waves, as the left side (pic 3, shows more of the back too) looks way better than my right side (pic1).\n\nI have high porosity hair, and it's often very dry past wash day. I do have professionally bleached/dyed hair, however I've had the same issues with my texture and dryness before bleaching it.\n\n\nHere's my routine (pic 1-3):\n- Shampoo twice with \"Imel Ruby Rings Shampoo for Curly Hair\"\n- Apply \"For the Love of Curls\" moisturising conditioner for 2 minutes across all my hair ( just barely not touching my roots ). Detangle with a medium sized tooth comb then wash it out. I have tried the squish to condish method in the past ( which leaves most of the conditioner in my hair ) but it did not make a difference honestly.\n\nThen while my hair is still wet:\n- Apply a good amount of Taft Curl Mousse everywhere.\n- And finally I scrunch in a pea sized amount of Taft Maxx Power Styling gel around my hair.\n\nPic 4 is when I only used a generous amount of Taft Maxx Power Styling gel on wet hair for reference…Without any conditioner though, as I only used the shampoo I mentioned earlier. it looked better than usual when initially diffused, but lacked any definition or any sort of longevity past 2 hours.\n\nI diffuse and that's it. Have no refresh routine ( which sucks, aside from wash day I brush out my hair to get more volume, and usually it's still moisturised so some curls form at the bottom ).\n\nHonestly just looking for a way to get consistent longevity and definition, maybe volume too if you guys have a way of it not being frizzy and not becoming flat immediately. Thank you in advance!!",
