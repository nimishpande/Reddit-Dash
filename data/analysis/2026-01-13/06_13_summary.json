In Feb 2025 I added oral min alongside the current medications. \n\nI decided to stop the topical usage of minoxidil and stick with only oral, hoping the switch would be fine. I made the transition gradually too, over the course of a few months.\n\nSadly to say, I’ve been shedding for over half a year nonstop and have lost all my hair. I keep losing hair every day. I know people say to give it time, but this 6+month shed hasn’t slowed down one bit, and I haven’t seen any crazy regrowth with oral min. I’ve literally had sheds and recovered from them in the amount of time I’m shedding right now.\n\nI’ve since started using topical minoxidil again, alongside both oral fin and min pills. \n\nAny comments or recommendations will be greatly appreciated, I’m basically starting over again. I’ll be using topical AND oral min, with oral fin.\n\n5% topical min, 0.5 oral fin, 2.5 oral min. Dosages have remained the same throughout the entire journey. Hopefully I can make another comeback.\n\nIn hindsight dropping topical minoxidil was definitely a dumb move, as I had great hair last summer. I only wanted to stop it because pills were easier. ",

If you have a scalp that NEEDS daily washing (literally mine suffers even if I wash every other day), AND you have curly, dense hair, do you just set 2 hours for your hair routine everyday?\n\nThe problem is, for many curly haired folks, the post-shower styling routine isn’t even a manage of styling: it’s a matter of preventing further knotting or damage to the hair strands.

I think if the whole head was the ‘wrong’ blonde id be happy, i honestly think im just dissapointed at how much natural hair is left.\n\ni showed these reference photos and the stylist was very confident we could accomplish them in one session, and seemed pleased with her results at the end.\n\nam i overreacting or should i go back to see if they can get me closer to the photos? or try to fix it myself at home? i feel really let down and confused, i don’t understand enough about this process to know what to think as of course i’m not a professional!",

I know what the point of surfactants, antifungal ingredients, preservatives and etc in shampoo is, but do ingredients which you typically see in conditioners/masks like oils/silicones/hydrolyzed proteins work the same in shampoo? My first thought was no because they'll probably be washed off with surfactants, but what if shampoo has gentle surfactants/formula? I know that shampoo doesn't stay on your head for long compared to conditioners, but some people wash their hair twice and take more time with it. So I wanted to ask if there is any research on this topic? \n\nI'm not sure how logical it is to add oils to shampoo but I see a lot of shampoos with oils in it. Same with proteins, peptides, silicones and amino acids like arginine, do they work when used in a shampoo?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "content": "Hello! I am trying to add hyaluronic acid into my routine, but then realized I'm not sure if I even have the best product order to get optimized results. I've just tried HA and now I have questions...\n\nFirstly, my typical skincare routine consists of:\n\n1. Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner (using a cotton pad)\n2. NEOGEN Real Ferment Micro Essence\n3. Mary &amp; May Vegan Blackberry Complex Essence\n4. Pyunkang Yul Black Tea Time Reverse Eye Cream (PM)\n5. MIDHA Rice Cream (AM) or Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream (PM)\n6. Dr. G Green Mild Up Sunscreen (AM)\n\nI have sensitive, combo-leaning-dry skin. All of these products have worked well with my skin and have not caused me irritation. I've been looking to add more hydration and find new products to help get plump, glowy skin. I wanted to introduce hyaluronic acid (specifically Isntree Ultra Low Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum), and started using it between the PKY toner and Neogen by just patting it into my skin. Is this even the right place to use it? I also trialed a couple times adding a couple drops of The Ordinary Squalane Oil to my moisturizer at night, but I don't want to overwhelm my skin with changes so will probably hold off for a little.\n\nI've never used HA before, but lots of people said to start with this one as can be seen as gentler and a good starting product. I introduced the HA slowly by just using it at night for a few days before using in the morning as well. Things were fine, my skin was looking so refreshed and hydrated! Then yesterday before applying the Tatcha, my skin felt very irritated/started to sting and turn pink. I rinsed my face immediately and just used the MIDHA Rice Cream (no fragrance, so I figured gentler than the Tatcha?), but it feels a little sensitive still and I'm not sure how to remedy? I read that HA works best with a wet/damp base, do you think applying the PKY toner with a cotton pad is not hydrating enough to use the HA right after and that's whats causing the upset? Should I be using the HA at a different time or using different application techniques? I apply everything with my hands except the PKY currently. \n\n  \nTLDR;\n\nIs this the best order to use my products? Where to add in HA? What to do if recent irritation after using HA? (I'm assuming the irritation is coming from the HA as everything else has stayed consistent, but I'm not sure!) Please help, I'm just a girl looking for juicy, plumpy skin and now I'm just stressed lol :((\n\nThank you! Any and all suggestions appreciated :)",

I've bitched about my fine curly hair on this sub before, and while I am perfectly okay with my current routine (it terms of how it makes my hair feel), I am still at a loss with the general shape of my hair, especially my roots constantly falling flat.\n\nMy current cut is grown out, but I initially asked  for shoulder length layers and an eye length bang. It looks fine for about a month but my hair grows so fast that my roots end up looking flat again, I find myself having to trim at home but there is only so much I can cut off. My hairstylist trims/reshapes every four months. I've tried root clips and foams, but neither give me a consistent or lasting lift. Root clips actually will slip out of my head when styling sometimes. \n\n\ncurrent routine for guidelines:\n\n1. clarify once every 3-5 days with ouai detox shampoo. apply leave-in conditioner as needed afterwards. \n\n2. Detangle, then define curls while wet. Seperate clumps.\n\n3. Microflop until damp, then apply mousse/foam (I alternate between NYM Curl Talk, Herbal Essence's Mousse, and Innersense I Create Lift)\n\n4. Diffuse upside down (kinda wanna stop doing this, it's hurting my back), incorporate root clips once 50% dry. Add a tiny bit of foam at the lengths for extra grit. \n\n5. Finish off with hair spray. \n\n⁠",
