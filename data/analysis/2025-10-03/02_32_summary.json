My main concern right now is dehydration. no matter how much water I drink, my skin still feels tight and looks a little dull.\n\nIâ€™d love to hear your recommendations for products or routines that have actually worked for you when it comes to improving hydration and overall skin health. Iâ€™m open to serums, moisturizers, masks, or even treatments, but would prefer to stick to skincare over in-clinic procedures for now.\n\nIf it helps, my skin type is normal/ acne-prone. My goal is plump, glowing skin that looks good both on and off camera.\n\nAny suggestions (or even brands you swear by) would be super appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance ðŸ’•",

Iâ€™m a November bride and looking to amp up my at-home skincare routine for this final month.\n\nI have oily, acne-prone skin and for the past 3 months, Iâ€™ve been following a simple yet consistent routine:  \n\n- Salicylic acid on alternate days  \n- Retinol (3x a week)  \n\nThe above along with cleanser, moisturiser and sunscreen. \n\nThis has definitely helped! My skin feels more glowy and Iâ€™ve even received compliments. However, I still have some texture and tiny bumps that Iâ€™d love to smooth out before the big day.\n\nI live in a small town, so I donâ€™t really trust the parlours here for facials or skin treatments â€” Iâ€™d prefer sticking to DIY/home-based remedies that are gentle and effective.\n\nWould love suggestions on:\n\n- Hydrating and glow-boosting home remedies\n  \n- Any simple masks or treatments (kitchen-friendly is a bonus!)  \n\n- Ways to calm texture and keep the skin looking healthy and fresh  \n\nCalling on brides and skincare pros, please share your secrets if youâ€™ve got them.\n\nIâ€™m not looking to overhaul my routine, just small additions that will help me feel my best on the day.
