I know NOTHING about treatments like facials, micro needling, etc….\n\nWould she benefit more from doing something like quarterly and maybe not as drastic of treatments? Or like twice a year do more?

      "content": "If you're new to SkincareAddiction: welcome!\n\nThis thread is the best place to start if you have questions about skincare products, your routine, and your skin. Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

But after around 6 months, it stopped giving me that “wow” effect — results became just *ok ok*.\n\nThen I read on The Ordinary’s site that the new pack should be stored cold. I tried keeping it in the freezer and boom — it worked again, though still just average compared to the first months.\n\nAfter 2 years on The Ordinary 0.5, I decided to shift to a higher concentration and switched to *Minimalist Retinol 0.6*. And boom again — it’s giving me beautiful results right now. It suits my skin just like The Ordinary did, but results are definitely better. Currently I use it once every 3 days.\n\nI also bought *Dot &amp; Key Retinol + Ceramide Night Cream*, but honestly it didn’t work for me at all… zero results, so now those jars are just sitting in a corner of my freezer.\n\n👉 So my question is: **is there any retinol better than these (The Ordinary 0.5 / Minimalist 0.6) in India that you guys have tried?** Would love to know your recommendations!",

Some are just skin-coloured which I don't mind as much, however sometimes I'll get these ones that seem more flat but are very red (they don't look as bad on camera for some reason). I've found that if I can ignore them for a few days they'll mostly fade, but a couple weeks later they pop up again in the exact same places. I struggled with excoriation disorder in the past so it's very difficult to just keep ignoring the look and feel of these marks every day, and they're also hard to conceal (admittedly I have occasionally broken and tried picking/squeezing a couple but it just results in PIE that takes months to fade). Any idea what this is/how to get rid of them for good?\n\nMy current routine:\n\nAM\n\n* the ordinary plant-derived squalane oil\n* the ordinary natural moisturising factors + phytoceramides\n* skin1004 centella sun serum\n\nPM\n\n* the ordinary plant-derived squalane oil\n* the ordinary natural moisturising factors + phytoceramides\n* the ordinary retinol 0.5% in squalane (only 2/3 times a week)\n* the ordinary lactic acid 10% + HA (again, only 2/3 times a week)\n* recently been incorporating azclear azelaic acid 20% on days where I haven't used retinol or lactic acid\n\nTIA!  \n",

      "content": "Hi! I’m curious about razor-cutting my own curly hair at home using Jayne Matthews’ method, but I’m finding the 2-class curly bangs/layers bundle prohibitively expensive ($290!). Would anyone on here be into splitting the cost and sharing the videos? Or, would someone who’s already purchased the classes be willing to share them with me for $$?\n\nI love the look of Jayne’s cuts and her expertise at creating face-framing layers. My curly hair has been thinning for about a year, and I’m looking to zhuzh it up and create the illusion of density with some crown layers and framing front pieces.\n\n///\n\nRoutine: \n1. I’ve been using Giovanni’s Tea Tree Oil shampoo &amp; Necessaire Rosemary Conditioner. (I don’t emphatically recommend either and am New Wash-curious but wary of exposing my fine hair to too much protein??) I massage in my shampoo with a little scalp massager.\n2. I’ve been detangling before showering to help minimize hair fall. To detangle, I mist my hair with water and then spray it with Pacifica Coconut Milk Detangle Elixir. I then gently detangle with my hands. \n3. After showering, I usually plop my hair and then spritz it with some It’s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Conditioner with Keratin and air dry, clipping my front section in the opposite direction for max volume. I also massage pumpkin oil into my scalp and ends most nights and sleep with my hair in a braid on a satin pillowcase. Not a perfect routine, but it generally allows me to wear my hair down for 2 or 3 days after washing, which is a victory in my book! ",

I've used face cream and it only lightly subdues the itchiness and redness. The only thing I've used that helps a bit more is a steroid cream but I dont want to thin my skin over time. \n\nAs for my eye bags, they've been bad since I got depression and insomnia also about 16 years ago. I've tried cold spoons in the morning and some \"eye bag\" cream that did nothing. I sleep way better now but still have deep dark eye bags. Im sure genetics have a play in it too but my identical twin brother doesnt have the eye bags I have.\n\nAlso I had an allergic reaction to saw dust when I worked at a lumber mill and my forehead exploded with humongous pimples. My young dumb *** thought it was just a bad case of acne, fought through it without treating it, and now I got deep fissure and craters on my forehead where it was heavily infected.\n\nJust looking for some advice or recommendations I can try out. \n\nThanks ",

I've changed my hair routine since I've got here, but only to try and combat the drying effects of the water.. to no avail :(. I went to college super close to where I grew up, so the environment is totally the same. I live in a very moist area like temperate forest type of that's helpful. \n\nI have fine hair that I'm pretty sure is high porosity\n\nwash day routine:\n\n1. NYM Naturals Rice Water &amp; Himalayan Moringa Superior Strength Conditioner\n2. NYM Natural Tahitian Gardenia &amp; Manga Butter Curl Defining Conditioner\n3. NYM leave in conditioner\n4. NYM gel\n5. air dry and then scrunch/shape hair with hair oil (forgot the brand?
