      "title": "What new hair-loss treatments actually look exciting right now (Oct 2025)",
      "content": "I’m a 35-yo diffuse thinner on fin 1 mg + oral min 4 mg. i went down the rabbit hole to see what’s *actually* coming that could add to (or replace) the usual suspects. tl;dr: there are a few legit late-stage contenders and some spicy early plays. sources at the end of each blurb.\n\n---\n\n### closest to real (late-stage)\n\n**Breezula® (clascoterone) topical AR blocker**  \nthink “local anti-androgen for the scalp.” two Phase 3 trials in men (SCALP1/2) have been running; company confirmed Phase 3 enrollment completion and keeps flagging it as a late-stage program. if results are good, this pairs nicely with fin/min because it blocks the androgen receptor without being a systemic 5-ARI. ([Cosmo Pharmaceuticals NV][1])\n\n**PP405 (Pelage) — stem-cell activation topical**  \nnot another anti-androgen: it tries to *reactivate dormant follicle stem cells*. Phase 2a this summer showed positive topline (some subjects &gt;20% density at 8 weeks in company materials) and they’re positioning for bigger studies. early, but this is the first thing in a while that hints at regrowth in “emptier” zones, not just thickening miniaturized hair. ([Business Wire][2])\n\n**ET-02 (Eirion Therapeutics) — regenerative topical, also targeting greying**  \nsimilar conceptual lane to PP405: aims to restore follicle stem cell function. Phase 1 readout this year showed strong early signal (higher non-vellus hair counts in just a few weeks, clean safety). Phase 2 is expected to launch late 2025 / early 2026. bonus twist: the company also claims ET-02 may revive melanocyte stem cells, meaning potential *grey hair reversal* on top of regrowth. still early days, but one of the more exciting regenerative plays. ([Eirion Therapeutics][9], [PR Newswire][10])\n\n---\n\n### new ways to hit androgens (mostly topical, scalp-focused)\n\n**KX-826 / pyrilutamide (topical AR antagonist)**  \ndata are mixed. some updates from the sponsor are upbeat, but independent coverage of larger trials has called out *no significant* advantage over placebo in key endpoints. still worth watching because it’s localized AR blockade with a light side-effect profile. ([hims][3])\n\n**GT20029 (AR-PROTAC) topical gel**  \ninstead of just blocking the receptor, it flags AR for **degradation**. Phase 2 in AGA hit its primary endpoint; next up would be bigger confirmatory work. if this holds up, it could be a potent scalp-only anti-androgen add-on. ([Clinical Trials Arena][4])\n\n---\n\n### a non-hormonal **oral** in the works\n\n**VDPHL01 (Veradermics)**  \ncompany bills it as a non-hormonal oral for AGA (male + female). U.S. trials are active (Phase 2/3 program); mechanism isn’t fully public yet. if it pans out, it’s the most interesting pill alternative for folks who can’t/won’t take 5-ARIs. ([Veradermics LIVE][5])\n\n---\n\n### RNA / gene-silencing (cosmetic territory, but intriguing)\n\n**CosmeRNA / SAMiRNA-AR68 (weekly siRNA topical)**  \naims to *down-regulate AR expression* in follicles. peer-reviewed early data show monthly hair-count gains with a weekly 5 mg/mL dose; it’s sold as a **cosmetic** in some places (i.e., not drug-approved), so treat as an adjunct experiment and judge by photos over months. ([Nature][6])\n\n---\n\n### regenerative / cell-based (cool, but not tomorrow)\n\n**Dermal papilla cell therapy (“hair cloning” vibes)**  \n**HairClone** says it’s setting up clinical work in 2025 (UK) to optimize protocols ahead of formal trials. on the flip side, **Stemson Therapeutics**—a big hope in this space—shut down in late 2024 due to funding, which shows how tough this field is. promising long-term, not clinic-ready today. ([hairclone.me][7])\n\n---\n\n### how i’d use this if you’re already on fin + oral min\n\n* **watch Breezula**: if Phase 3 reads out well, it’s the most plug-and-play add-on (local AR block + your current stack). ([Cosmo Pharmaceuticals NV][1])  \n* **track both PP405 and ET-02**: they’re different takes on stem-cell reactivation and could complement everything else; ET-02 may even have a bonus impact on greying. ([Business Wire][2], [Eirion Therapeutics][9])  \n* **if you’re 5-ARI-averse**, track **VDPHL01** as a future pill option. ([Veradermics LIVE][5])  \n* **for topical AR upgrades**, KX-826 and GT20029 are still moving, but wait for clearer, larger data. ([Perfect Hair Health][8])  \n* **RNA topicals** are interesting but not drug-grade yet—OK to tinker with as adjuncts if you like to experiment responsibly.

      "content": "(First pic pre-haircut, the rest post-haircut with styling.)\n\nHi, everyone! Recently I got my hair cut by a curly hair specialist for the first time. I rarely trust salons to do my hair, but I was hopeful with this one, the stylist had a great portfolio.\n\nI asked for some light layering to revive my curl pattern and for some face framing. I also mentioned that my curls tend to relax a lot from the second day on and that I don't want a high maintenance cut, just some shaping. The effect... Well, I don't love it when it's heavily styled as she instructed me, and it unfortunately gets worse by day. I don't have time to restyle, that's why I asked for something lower-maintenance. Most of the time I end up just wanting to just tie it up, which kinda sucks. \n\nAm I overreacting, or are the layers badly cut? Is this just the kind of cut that has to be heavily styled? Any hope of fixing this at home? Please, be honest. \n\nMy routine (all recommended by the stylist):\n- Yope hydrate shampoo\n- John Frieda dream curls conditioner\n- Cantu avocado repair leave-in (a bit scrunched on soaking wet hair) \n- Kemon actyva bellessere gel (same as above) \n- Diffusing",

      "content": "I want to look good. I go to the gym and at least try with skincare, but my hair is what really throws me off. I think it’s curly, though it might just be wavy. I had my hair cut really short for like 15 years, so I never really grew it out and always thought it was straight so I have no clue what to do with my hair. Now that it’s longer, it’s tough to manage and sometimes feels too feminine when I wear it down and I feel like girls don't like it. Also, I really love wearing hats and I literally can't anymore. My hair is like a built in hat now. I included a recent pic I took with a hat and I look like an idiot.\n\nI usually wear my hair over my eyebrows or I try to do a middle part, but it can cover my eyes, which I don’t like at all because sometimes it cooks my skin. Also, it totally covers my ears which isn't horrible, but not my favorite. When it’s down, the frizz and breakage make it look messy fast, and after day one it just gets harder to control. I don’t want to go back to a buzz cut, but I also don’t want to keep hiding it. I also live in a really humid place so that doesn't help the frizz.\n\n\n My routine right now:\n- I don’t diffuse or use heat\n- Dove Shampoo about 2x a week\n- Dove Conditioner about 4x a week\n- Aunt Jackie's loosing Curl creme, their leave in conditioner, and Shea butter gel (I think. It doesn't work for my hair so I'm switching to something else) in that order and do the scrunch for everything while hair is wet.\n\nWhat I’d love advice on:\n- Haircuts that work well for me.\n- Styling that make hair look masculine without going back to a buzz cut.\n- Tips to reduce breakage so I can wear it down more often.\n- I would love to wear hats again so any tips\n- any products I need or you recomend",

      "title": "[Routine Help] The 5-Step “Skin Barrier Rescue” Routine (For When Your Skin Freaks Out)",
      "content": "Is your skin acting like it’s got a personal grudge - red, stingy, peeling, or breaking out nonstop? I’ve been there (retinol, you betrayed me). Chances are, your skin barrier’s crying for help. I’ve got a straightforward routine to calm it down and get it back to normal. No fluff, no sales, just stuff that actually helps.\n\nYour skin barrier’s like a shield - ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids lock in moisture and keep irritants out. When it’s damaged (over-exfoliating, harsh actives, or even brutal weather), you’re left with redness, burning, flakes, or acne that won’t quit. Here’s how to fix it in 2 - 4 weeks:\n\nDrop all actives. Retinol, AHAs, BHAs, vitamin C - put them away. They’re great long-term, but they’ll make things worse now. Switch to a gentle, pH-balanced cleanser (pH around 5–6, like your skin’s natural vibe). Skip foaming cleansers with sulfates; they strip too much. Slather on a moisturizer packed with ceramides, cholesterol, or fatty acids, morning and night. If your skin’s super dry or flaky, add an occlusive like Vaseline or Aquaphor at night to seal in moisture. Stick with this for 2–4 weeks, and don’t skip sunscreen (it’s a must!). Once your skin’s chill, you can ease actives back in.\n\nHere are some solid, easy-to-find products you can grab at drugstores or online, based on my own trial-and-error and stuff this sub raves about:\n\n* CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (\\~$10–15): Creamy, non-foaming, loaded with ceramides.\n* La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser (\\~$15): Ultra-soothing for sensitive skin.\n* First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Face Cleanser (\\~$24): Fragrance-free, gentle, pH-balanced.\n* CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion (\\~$15): Has ceramides, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid.\n* Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream (\\~$20): Light, hydrating, great for oily skin.\n* Drunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped Cream (\\~$60): A bit spendy but a barrier-repair champ.\n* Aquaphor Healing Ointment (\\~$10): Perfect for slugging dry, flaky skin.\n* Vaseline Petroleum Jelly (\\~$5): Cheap, simple, and does the job.\n* Weleda Skin Food (\\~$20): Rich, awesome for dry patches.\n* CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 (\\~$15): Moisturizes with sun protection, no irritation.\n* La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-in Milk SPF 60 (\\~$25): Lightweight, fragrance-free sunscreen.\n\nQuick Q&amp;A: Yes, sunscreen’s non-negotiable, even with a damaged barrier—go for mineral ones with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide to keep irritation low. Wait till your skin’s calm (no redness or stinging) for a week before reintroducing actives, starting with something gentle like 0.025% retinol once a week. Still breaking out after 2 weeks? A derm might be your next step. Hyaluronic acid’s fine; just use it on damp skin and lock it in with moisturizer.\n\nWhat’s your go-to for rescuing a wrecked skin barrier? Drop your fave products or tips below - I need some new recs! Let’s share what works.",

In the last two weeks or so I’ve noticed a significant amount of dry skin and redness in the mustache area. \n\nI shaved to see if this would help, after a few days red irritation turned into a bunch of pimples. I pimple patched them and they went away. \n\nNow my mustache is starting to grow in again and I’m noticing the redness and dry skin is returning. I’m probably going to shave again to keep the acne at bay but ideally I would like to keep my mustache. \n\nI get the occasional acne here and there but generally do not have a significant amount of skin issues so I’m a bit caught off guard by this. Would love any advice to help get my skin back on track. \n\n\nAM Routine:\nVanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser\nSkin1004 centella ampoule\nCerave daily moisturizing lotion \n\nPM routine:\nVanicream gentle facial cleanser\nAvene Cicalfate repair cream\n\nOnce a week or so I’ll use Alba Botanical Acnedote face wash in the morning. \n\n\nFirst picture is the acne that showed up after I noticed the dry skin and shaved. \n\nSecond picture is the irritation/dry skin appearing again after my mustache started growing back. \n",

I put leave in (kc curling cream) and 3 tons of hair gel (two kinds, kc pink gel and eco style green gel). I separated my hair in teeny tiny sections and got my roots with product. After an hour I finished the left side of my hair (about 1/3 of it) including the left side of my bangs. I didn't even get to the right side or the middle of my hair and I said WTFFFFFF!!! This looks horrible. So I gave up and just braided my hair in big chunks. I will admit I didn't actually do this after I washed. I did it a few days after but I made sure my hair was soaked with water before applying product. \n\nI think I wasn't meant to have curly hair because idk what the hell I should I do. This is too time consuming and I look miserable. Should I just stick to straightening and braids or do you guys see damage?? What am I doing wrong. \n\nRoutine \nI usually wash my hair with Shea moisture shampoo\nDeep condition with Shea moisture \nSometimes I sit in my steam shower for some time when I do this\nThen I apply some oil when I'm done. Coconut, jojoba, apricot, black seed or whatever I have. I usually go to the salon and get some braids or straighten my hair and leave it for about a week. If I don't do either of these things, I leave my hair looking crazy and wear a headband and call it a day. \n\nHistory\nMy hair has always been long, about waist length. I had some damage around April 2024 and I was patiently waiting for my hair to grow. About a month ago it was enough hair so I did a big chop. This is all new hair growth and it's healthy. I did some layers and bangs. It's around my shoulder. \n",
