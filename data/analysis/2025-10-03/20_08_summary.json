      "content": "I’m a 35-yo diffuse thinner on fin 1 mg + oral min 4 mg. i went down the rabbit hole to see what’s *actually* coming that could add to (or replace) the usual suspects. tl;dr: there are a few legit late-stage contenders and some spicy early plays. sources at the end of each blurb.\n\n---\n\n### closest to real (late-stage)\n\n**Breezula® (clascoterone) topical AR blocker**  \nthink “local anti-androgen for the scalp.” two Phase 3 trials in men (SCALP1/2) have been running; company confirmed Phase 3 enrollment completion and keeps flagging it as a late-stage program. if results are good, this pairs nicely with fin/min because it blocks the androgen receptor without being a systemic 5-ARI. ([Cosmo Pharmaceuticals NV][1])\n\n**PP405 (Pelage) — stem-cell activation topical**  \nnot another anti-androgen: it tries to *reactivate dormant follicle stem cells*. Phase 2a this summer showed positive topline (some subjects &gt;20% density at 8 weeks in company materials) and they’re positioning for bigger studies. early, but this is the first thing in a while that hints at regrowth in “emptier” zones, not just thickening miniaturized hair. ([Business Wire][2])\n\n**ET-02 (Eirion Therapeutics) — regenerative topical, also targeting greying**  \nsimilar conceptual lane to PP405: aims to restore follicle stem cell function. Phase 1 readout this year showed strong early signal (higher non-vellus hair counts in just a few weeks, clean safety). Phase 2 is expected to launch late 2025 / early 2026. bonus twist: the company also claims ET-02 may revive melanocyte stem cells, meaning potential *grey hair reversal* on top of regrowth. still early days, but one of the more exciting regenerative plays. ([Eirion Therapeutics][9], [PR Newswire][10])\n\n---\n\n### new ways to hit androgens (mostly topical, scalp-focused)\n\n**KX-826 / pyrilutamide (topical AR antagonist)**  \ndata are mixed. some updates from the sponsor are upbeat, but independent coverage of larger trials has called out *no significant* advantage over placebo in key endpoints. still worth watching because it’s localized AR blockade with a light side-effect profile. ([hims][3])\n\n**GT20029 (AR-PROTAC) topical gel**  \ninstead of just blocking the receptor, it flags AR for **degradation**. Phase 2 in AGA hit its primary endpoint; next up would be bigger confirmatory work. if this holds up, it could be a potent scalp-only anti-androgen add-on. ([Clinical Trials Arena][4])\n\n---\n\n### a non-hormonal **oral** in the works\n\n**VDPHL01 (Veradermics)**  \ncompany bills it as a non-hormonal oral for AGA (male + female). U.S. trials are active (Phase 2/3 program); mechanism isn’t fully public yet. if it pans out, it’s the most interesting pill alternative for folks who can’t/won’t take 5-ARIs. ([Veradermics LIVE][5])\n\n---\n\n### RNA / gene-silencing (cosmetic territory, but intriguing)\n\n**CosmeRNA / SAMiRNA-AR68 (weekly siRNA topical)**  \naims to *down-regulate AR expression* in follicles. peer-reviewed early data show monthly hair-count gains with a weekly 5 mg/mL dose; it’s sold as a **cosmetic** in some places (i.e., not drug-approved), so treat as an adjunct experiment and judge by photos over months. ([Nature][6])\n\n---\n\n### regenerative / cell-based (cool, but not tomorrow)\n\n**Dermal papilla cell therapy (“hair cloning” vibes)**  \n**HairClone** says it’s setting up clinical work in 2025 (UK) to optimize protocols ahead of formal trials. on the flip side, **Stemson Therapeutics**—a big hope in this space—shut down in late 2024 due to funding, which shows how tough this field is. promising long-term, not clinic-ready today. ([hairclone.me][7])\n\n---\n\n### how i’d use this if you’re already on fin + oral min\n\n* **watch Breezula**: if Phase 3 reads out well, it’s the most plug-and-play add-on (local AR block + your current stack). ([Cosmo Pharmaceuticals NV][1])  \n* **track both PP405 and ET-02**: they’re different takes on stem-cell reactivation and could complement everything else; ET-02 may even have a bonus impact on greying. ([Business Wire][2], [Eirion Therapeutics][9])  \n* **if you’re 5-ARI-averse**, track **VDPHL01** as a future pill option. ([Veradermics LIVE][5])  \n* **for topical AR upgrades**, KX-826 and GT20029 are still moving, but wait for clearer, larger data. ([Perfect Hair Health][8])  \n* **RNA topicals** are interesting but not drug-grade yet—OK to tinker with as adjuncts if you like to experiment responsibly.

The one I keep going back to is Cetaphil oil free daily lotion but it’s not that hydrating. But, it doesn’t break me out. It’s the most non-offensive. And maybe this will help other people as well. \nMoisturizers I’ve tried this year:\nAvene tolerance control \nClinique dramatically different lotion \nCetaphil cream (in the small jar for face)\nPeach slices snail rescue oil free (this one didn’t break me out, but sucked all the moisture from my skin lol) \nAvene Cicalfate+\nPurito calming oat gel (same thing as peach slices, sucked all moisture out) \nBarrier 360 cream by Aestra? (Can’t remember the name exactly) this has niacinamide which I’m allergic to and it left me red, angry, and bumpy. \nThe Dieux instant angel \nPurito dermide cica sleep pack (I actually love this, but after using for extended period of time, I start to breakout cause it is a midweight heavy moisturizer) but it feels soooo nice on the skin. I recommend this if you’re not acne prone, and dry/dehydrated!! \n\nI have been using skincare for a long time. I can try a moisturizer for a week to see if it will bother my skin because my acne primarily shows up on my chin, so if I get it elsewhere, I know it’s the culprit. Other moisturizers I’ve tried in the past that don’t work: neutrogena water gel, cerave, aveeno daily hydrating lotion, vanicream, the ordinary HA daily moisturizing factors.\n\nI am considering these: \nTatcha water cream, drunk elephant peptides portini, oSea water cream, versed dew gel cream, aveeno calm and restore gel. \n\nI do not mind paying high end prices if it works. At this point I am at my wits end.\n",

Pretty active and healthy people.\n\nWhat would be the best “bang for your buck” things I could do to help my wife with keeping her skin looking healthy and young and feeling healthy as well? I know NOTHING about treatments like facials, micro needling, etc….\n\nWould she benefit more from doing something like quarterly and maybe not as drastic of treatments? Or like twice a year do more? I don’t even know what things cost…\n\nHoping to not spend more than maybe $2-3k per year on all of this.\n\nThanks for the info and insights ahead of time!",

Our community is knowledgeable, and we want to help you have the best skin of your life!\n\n# Do you have a question?\n\n# Step 1: Read our resources\n\nBe sure to check out our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index)! There are a lot of topics covered in those links, but some of the most popular guides include:\n\n \n\n* [The ScA Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) *(Need a routine? Start here!)*\n* [Routine Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/routine_order)\n* [HG Product Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hg_threads_index)\n\n \n\n* [Acne](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/acne)\n* [Hyperigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/hyperpigmentation) *(including dark acne 'scars'/marks, melasma, etc.)*\n* [Dehydrated Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n\n \n\nIf you can't find an answer, or you have additional questions after reading, please move on to step 2!\n\n \n\n# Step 2: Ask for help\n\nTo give you the best advice possible, our users need relevant information about your skin and skincare. With your request for help please include:\n\n \n\n* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you \n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n\n\n# Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree.\n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!\n\nOnce a year, we have a big thank you post for everyone who has helped out in the DHT where we give out nifty flairs &amp; gold to exceptionally informative and kind users. Check out our list of [ScA Helpers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/contributors) and [our most recent thank you post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ahnt49/meta_giving_awards_and_thanking_sca_contributors/)!\n\nWhether it be in-depth responses that deserve to be their own guides, thoughtful product recommendations, or simply pointing someone in the right direction, we appreciate all the time and effort you've made to help others!\n\n# [Previous Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/search?q=title%3AAsk+ScA&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n*This thread is posted every day at 12:00am ET.*",

Some strands are wavy, some coil and some are simply straight. I mostly blow-dry my hair and use a straightener to make my hair look smooth, but a few raindrops will turn it into a frizzy mess. Oh, and my hair is untreated (no color or bleach).\n\nI'm super unhappy with it. I have tried different techniques - sometimes it comes out nice, but by the end of the day, my hair looks flat. Other times, it just looks stringy and greasy. \n\nCurrent routine:\n- wash with a curly shampoo\n- scrunch/squish in the conditioner\n- part my hair in the shower\n- adding foam with my head upside down and squishing it in\n- add gel and squish it in as well\n- micro-plop with a microfiber towel\n- plop for 5 minutes\n- dry with a diffuser and then scrunch out the cast with a tiny bit of hair oil \n\nThis seems like a lot for the uneven, stringy and frizzing hair of mine haha.\n\nAny recommendation/help?",

I've used face cream and it only lightly subdues the itchiness and redness. The only thing I've used that helps a bit more is a steroid cream but I dont want to thin my skin over time. \n\nAs for my eye bags, they've been bad since I got depression and insomnia also about 16 years ago. I've tried cold spoons in the morning and some \"eye bag\" cream that did nothing. I sleep way better now but still have deep dark eye bags. Im sure genetics have a play in it too but my identical twin brother doesnt have the eye bags I have.\n\nAlso I had an allergic reaction to saw dust when I worked at a lumber mill and my forehead exploded with humongous pimples. My young dumb *** thought it was just a bad case of acne, fought through it without treating it, and now I got deep fissure and craters on my forehead where it was heavily infected.\n\nJust looking for some advice or recommendations I can try out. \n\nThanks ",

I don’t have a lot yet (maybe 20-30 all over my hair) but I have brown hair so it really stands out and that bugs me so I’d like to start covering them.\n\nI know the best option for white hair is to go lighter so that the roots don’t contrast as much, but my roots are still a lot more brown than white, so I’d like to enjoy my natural colour a bit longer and to have something low maintenance still while I can.\n\nI was thinking of doing a coloured gloss. I know it’s not going to cover the greys completely, but I’m thinking it could help them blend better. I’ve seen a lot of different opinions on gloss on white hair so I was wondering what you guys think. If I go that route I was thinking of doing it at home with redken shades EQ. Is that a bad idea? And how do I pick the right colour?\n\nMy other option is to cut them until there’s too many to do so. I was doing that for a year until I stopped (about 6 months ago). I stopped because it’s slightly annoying when they grow back as little white spikes.\n\nHas anyone gone through this and what did you do??\n\nThank you for any help/advice!!",

This isn’t an ad but I wanted to do my due diligence as an esthetician and try out the products that I use at work. I also purchased the Age Intervention duality serum because I’ve heard good things about it, especially for hormonal acne. \n\nI’ve used many benzoyl peroxide products before and they help, but not a ton, so I was skeptical. But duality also has retinol so I had some hope. It took a week, maybe a week and a half for my skin to get used to it, so a little over a week ago I felt comfortable enough to add in the cesta serum and bioclear lotion during the AM. Bioclear has salicylic, glycolic and azealic so that is definitely also helping a lot with acne and HP. \n\nWe’re not quite there yet but there’s definitely some notable results. Not only is my acne improving, the post inflammatory HP is also fading away. My skin texture feels insanely better. So much smoother and softer. Here’s my current routine. I’m very excited to see how my skin will look another month from now. For the sake of typing I’ll be referring to Jan Marini Skin Solutions as just JM for short. \n\nAM: \n-vanicream gentle face wash\n-JM Cesta serum\n-JM Bioclear lotion\n-JM transformation cream\n-JM antioxidant SPF 33\n\nPM:\n-PCA skin daily cleansing oil \n-JM Cesta cleanser \n-JM Age intervention duality\n-JM transformation cream\n\n3 days out of the week I use the dermalogica microfoliant in my PM routine.
