My main concern right now is dehydration. no matter how much water I drink, my skin still feels tight and looks a little dull.\n\nI’d love to hear your recommendations for products or routines that have actually worked for you when it comes to improving hydration and overall skin health. I’m open to serums, moisturizers, masks, or even treatments, but would prefer to stick to skincare over in-clinic procedures for now.\n\nIf it helps, my skin type is normal/ acne-prone. My goal is plump, glowing skin that looks good both on and off camera.\n\nAny suggestions (or even brands you swear by) would be super appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance 💕",

I’m a November bride and looking to amp up my at-home skincare routine for this final month.\n\nI have oily, acne-prone skin and for the past 3 months, I’ve been following a simple yet consistent routine:  \n\n- Salicylic acid on alternate days  \n- Retinol (3x a week)  \n\nThe above along with cleanser, moisturiser and sunscreen. \n\nThis has definitely helped! My skin feels more glowy and I’ve even received compliments. However, I still have some texture and tiny bumps that I’d love to smooth out before the big day.\n\nI live in a small town, so I don’t really trust the parlours here for facials or skin treatments — I’d prefer sticking to DIY/home-based remedies that are gentle and effective.\n\nWould love suggestions on:\n\n- Hydrating and glow-boosting home remedies\n  \n- Any simple masks or treatments (kitchen-friendly is a bonus!)  \n\n- Ways to calm texture and keep the skin looking healthy and fresh  \n\nCalling on brides and skincare pros, please share your secrets if you’ve got them.\n\nI’m not looking to overhaul my routine, just small additions that will help me feel my best on the day.

      "title": "Has anyone seen real results with an acne mark removal gel for old scars?",
      "content": "I suffered from acne as a teenager, and they have left some stubborn marks on my skin. I tried makeup, but it'll make the matter worse since I have sensitive skin, so I searched for a product that would help me fade away these scars. I began searching for gels to remove acne marks. I wasn't sure if I should try new products due to my sensitive skin, and also because countless products were claiming to deliver similar results, and I didn't want to waste time or money. Still, I gave it a shot and did my research before giving it a try, and here's what I found.\n\n\n\nIt turns out that a few ingredients, such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid, nicotinamide, etc, are the best ingredients to remove acne and its scars. These ingredients can kill acne-causing bacteria and control excess oil on your skin. Nicotinamide is a form of vitamin B3 that reduces inflammation, redness, and swelling. By the recommendation of someone I trusted, I used Acnestar acne gel. I used the gel religiously each night, and I wore my sunscreen each morning to protect my skin. In the first few weeks, I didn't notice anything honestly but kept applying it. I also noticed a bit of dryness so I used a moisturiser too. Honestly, I took some time to show results.\n\n\n\nAt around two months, I began to see real change. The newer marks faded the fastest, but I watched some older ones that had been there for years fade as well. It wasn't a drastic overnight transformation, but it was enough of a change that kept me motivated to use the products. I kept my skincare very simple throughout the time, a gentle cleanser, acne removal gel and moisturiser. My skin was calmer and less irritated.\n\n\n\nI felt like the gel was pretty effective for acnemarks. Not all my marks are removed, specifically any pitted or textured scars, but they may require more advanced treatments like microneedling or laser therapy. But in terms of the dark marks and uneven tone, the acne mark removal gel did work for me (I tried AcneStar). If you are struggling with acne marks, I would absolutely suggest giving them a try, but with realistic expectations, consistency, and, of course, don't forget the sunscreen.\n\n",
