      "title": "Has anyone seen real results with an acne mark removal gel for old scars?",
      "content": "I suffered from acne as a teenager, and they have left some stubborn marks on my skin. I tried makeup, but it'll make the matter worse since I have sensitive skin, so I searched for a product that would help me fade away these scars. I began searching for gels to remove acne marks. I wasn't sure if I should try new products due to my sensitive skin, and also because countless products were claiming to deliver similar results, and I didn't want to waste time or money. Still, I gave it a shot and did my research before giving it a try, and here's what I found.\n\n\n\nIt turns out that a few ingredients, such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid, nicotinamide, etc, are the best ingredients to remove acne and its scars. These ingredients can kill acne-causing bacteria and control excess oil on your skin. Nicotinamide is a form of vitamin B3 that reduces inflammation, redness, and swelling. By the recommendation of someone I trusted, I used Acnestar acne gel. I used the gel religiously each night, and I wore my sunscreen each morning to protect my skin. In the first few weeks, I didn't notice anything honestly but kept applying it. I also noticed a bit of dryness so I used a moisturiser too. Honestly, I took some time to show results.\n\n\n\nAt around two months, I began to see real change. The newer marks faded the fastest, but I watched some older ones that had been there for years fade as well. It wasn't a drastic overnight transformation, but it was enough of a change that kept me motivated to use the products. I kept my skincare very simple throughout the time, a gentle cleanser, acne removal gel and moisturiser. My skin was calmer and less irritated.\n\n\n\nI felt like the gel was pretty effective for acnemarks. Not all my marks are removed, specifically any pitted or textured scars, but they may require more advanced treatments like microneedling or laser therapy. But in terms of the dark marks and uneven tone, the acne mark removal gel did work for me (I tried AcneStar). If you are struggling with acne marks, I would absolutely suggest giving them a try, but with realistic expectations, consistency, and, of course, don't forget the sunscreen.\n\n",

I am currently using plum toner, dot&amp;key barrier repair moisturizer, aqualogica sunscreen, derma co aha bha peel, tretin 0.025 and aziderm 10% gel. \n\nI came across a post which talked about barrier repair and people suggested the LRP Baume cream. I have also heard that snail mucin helps with acne scars. I have used it once and it didn‚Äôt give me any breakouts but I used it on random days so didn‚Äôt see any results. \n\nSo if I completely switch my skincare to the attached products, will they help me in reducing breakouts and scarring? If yes, then in which order, and how often?",
