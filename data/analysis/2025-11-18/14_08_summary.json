      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Unfortunately for many of us, there have been ~thousands of comments on social media &amp; forums online (I tracked, haha) discussing Creatine &amp; hair loss with the popular opinion trending toward it worsening hair loss. This is odd, because there don't seem to definitive biomolecular reasons this should affect DHT production.\n\nStill, no studies exist that credibly study the relation between both. Which is why, if this gets enough interest, I &amp; some academic friends will be conducting the first large, credible study on Creatine &amp; DHT correlation next month.  \n  \nThis will be a basic 4-week double-blind study where you can take your own Creatine, or a free generic month's worth of supply provided by us. \n\nTo participate, please indicate interest below &amp; we'll get back to you! Why participate? If we can conclusively prove no effect, it'll mean you can get the same or better gains going to the gym much, much faster (22% in modern samples) &amp; maintain markers of brain health.\n\nCreatine is a well-studied, fantastic, beautifully harmless supplement.

      "content": "Hey all, \n\nSearched around this subreddit and online and couldn't find any good examples of this happening with oral minoxidil, but has anybody else gotten facial Pili Multigemini (compound hair growth) from oral minoxidil? I have relatively thick facial hair, and started oral minoxidil roughly a year ago at 2.5mg, once a day.  I haven't noticed these elsewhere on my body, just on my face. \n\n\n\nI used to get these compound hairs once every couple of months, but now I've been finding them after shaving 1-3x per week. They almost always end up becoming ingrown hairs/turning into zits if I don't pluck them, and I've been shaving with a Norelco OneBlade which generally doesn't leave any ingrown hairs/irritate my skin at all. I wash my face with a silicone scrubber in the shower (helps exfoliation), apply moisturizer 1x per day. At night I wash my face and apply 0.5% tretinoin cream 2-3x weekly. I've had this skincare routine for years, so nothing's really changed on that front. \n\n\n\nThese aren't particularly bad or anything, but I'm wondering if anybody has any advice on how to deal with them, or if they've also experienced dealing with these. Overall oral minox has been pretty good for me, I tried finasteride a few years ago, had some bad side effects, but aside from extra body hair/ear hair and these, no negative side effects on minoxidil. \n\n\n\n(Photo taken from elsewhere on Reddit, I never seem to remember to take a photo of these whenever I pull them).

I’ve also stopped the monthly facials and went back to trentinoin, so my skin is currently in that purge phase. I’ve also stopped self tanning/spray tanning bc honestly I can’t get it right and my hands always turn out orange. Everything kind of came to a head when I got my driver’s license updated today with my new last name and I got my picture taken when I wasn’t expecting to…it’s the worst picture I’ve taken in a while and of course it’s my new license photo, so self esteem is an all time low. So long story short, instead of being upset I’m going to do something for me. \n\nWhat do you do for beauty when you feel like you need a change, update, pick me up, whatever you do to make yourself feel pretty?

I always tend to have a few red spots or small pinples, and general redness.\nMy current routine is:\nMorning:\n* ﻿﻿Wash face with water\n* ﻿﻿Nø Cosmetics 120h Liquid Hydrator\n* ﻿﻿Weleda Skin Food Light\n* ﻿﻿La Roche Posay oil correct spf 50 sunscreen\nNight:\n* ﻿﻿La roche Posay Lipikar Cleansing Oil\n* ﻿﻿Cerave Foaming Cleanser\n* ﻿﻿EITHER Boderm Tazarotene 0.1% OR Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant (Tazarotene probably 2-3 times a week and Paula's choice 2 times a week, with rest days in between sometimes)\n* ﻿﻿Weleda Skin Food (normal not light)\n\nIs there anything I can add or should take away to help against the spots, redness etc? I’d like to even out my skin texture and tone as much as I can and achieve as much of a clear skin look as possible.\n\nI do like to work out so sometimes I wonder if the sweating causes more pimples and spots on the face, any tips to prevent this are also very much appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance ♥️",

      "title": "Why hasn’t anyone made a \"DHT sponge\" biologic yet???",
      "content": "\nSo I’ve been thinking about this for a while and honestly I don’t get why this isn’t already a thing. We already have tons of biologic drugs that basically work as “sponges” for stuff in the blood. Like monoclonal antibodies that bind PCSK9 for cholesterol or ones that bind TNF-α, IL-6 and whatever for inflammation. That tech already exists and works.\n\nSo the idea is super simple in my head:\njust make a big protein that only sticks to DHT, dump it in the bloodstream, and boom -&gt;&gt; free DHT gets neutralized as it floats around. Meanwhile 5-alpha-reductase is untouched so neurosteroids don’t get nuked like with finasteride/dutasteride. And when you stop taking the drug, the protein levels drop and everything goes back to normal. Seems way cleaner than blocking 5-AR itself.\n\nThere’s even bonus points: big proteins usually don’t cross the blood-brain barrier well, so in theory you’d mostly suppress peripheral DHT (scalp, skin, prostate etc) but maybe leave more brain DHT alone. So possibly less CNS interference than fin/dutasteride. Making something selective with a protein is way easier than with a tiny small molecule that binds everything.\n\nYeah, it would probably have to be an injection and would be stupid expensive cuz biologics always are. And obviously you’d still be suppressing DHT systemically so long-term safety would need studying. But as far as WHAT PHARMA COULD ACTUALLY BUILD in the next 5 years? This seems like the most realistic shot at “DHT suppression without resucing neurosteroids.”\n\nSo… legit question:\nWhy hasn’t anyone made this yet?\n\nIs it just lack of market interest? Technical limitations? Patents? No one’s thought of it? Or is there some huge reason this wouldn’t work that I’m missing?",

I also suffer with redness in my face I’m not sure if that’s because of the acne or a separate issue but I would like help with my routine and maybe some advice on what I could add. I’m finding the obagi expensive I’ve used it for a year and I don’t have to rebuy it too often but I’d be very open to similar cheaper options.

Just vibesssss.\n\nSo obsivously they do.....nothing. \n\nAnd here's the plot twist nobody told me:\n\nAHA +Vitamin C body washes actually make sense becuase they're basically giving your body same treatment your face gets- exfoliation+brighteness without those physical hrad scrubs that scratch your soul. \n\nIf you've found an AHA or Vit C bpdy wash that actually did something (bonus points if it's budget-friendly), drop it below.\n\nLet's save each other from spending money on scented disappointment.😭",

I also am only just starting to use the Differin spot treatment again cause the purge period with adapalene has been rough😭. But my main reason for asking for help is what is everyone who struggles with acne using for moisturizer, especially during the sensitive purge days? I am interested in this sample kit I found good reviews about, and I saw some people recommending that brands “Balm” and “Cream”. I used to use Aquaphor or Vaseline during the winter time and especially for chapped lips, but my skin is so sensitive right now and prone to acne that I don’t want to risk using them, but my skin is burning so bad sometimes these days I really would love any help finding a product that would make my skin feel like it is literally drinking it like water, that won’t break me out during this time😭 Also, what order does everyone use these products in?? Right now I am doing cleansing, wash, adap gel, spot treatment (sometimes,) and then scar cream and moisturizer. I also am totally open to hearing opinions about these products I am using and am all ears to better ideas!! I used to be on doxycycline and that helped my acne so much but I am not in a position right now to see a derm, and I am not really open to being on an antibiotic unless I have to!

Even when it's not breaking out into acne, I can see the pores are congested, so I tried tretinoin (v mild to start) about a year ago to try and clear it and all it did was break me out. I thought this was \"purging\" but it didn't subside even after a couple of months so I stopped using it. I then tried salicylic acid in the hope this might help, but it didn't seem to make a difference either way. Unfortunately the break outs haven't stopped since. Any advice?  \nOther info:\n\nI want to keep my skincare routine simple because of eczema/sensitive skin. I use Aveeno daily moisturising cream as my moisturiser as it's good for my dry skin, I use SPF for sensitive skin, and Inkey List's hyaluronic acid cleanser to wash my face at night.\n\nI also am on the progesterone-only (mini) pill and wondered if this could be causing the issue? I didn't have break outs when I was on the combined pill (though my skin was still congested around the chin) but I had to change for medical reasons.  \nHelp!",

Ngl I feel hurt because I really wanna embrace my curls, but they think straightening it is the right thing to do. \n\nMy curly hair routine:\n1- wash day:any shampoo ( rn it's casmoline, made in Lebanon) and then a generous amount of conditioner(also casmoline) . Ofc I detangle my hair in the shower and I also scrunch it. After that I scrunch it with a cotton shirt. And I apply a good amount of leave in conditioner, then I leave it to air dry, then I apply like 2 drops of rose oil. \n\n2- other days: I wet my hair then I brush it, then I apply the leave in and scrunch it , air dry, oil. \n\nWell I think I do need a mousse or gel or smth . Tbh I can't buy expensive products, well so let's pray we get the job🤣\n\nAnyways yeah, what do you think should I do?\n\nNote: maybe they call this wavy or curly I have no idea, I just call it curly because sometimes it looks more curly than this lmao. \n\n",

I have not been using a new lip balm, just the same ones from back home that i brought with me. I try to drink water and I have started usign vaseline on my lips and they got better for a bit a week or two ago but now they are bad again and its so annoying!! Is there a cream that I can use that will help this? The day they looked like they were getting better was the day after i started using vaseline and i had chugged a bunch of water and ate like 2 kiwis for vitamin c and took my b complex and iron pills incase it was vitamin related, but I had already been taking those once or twice a week anyways?? idk, I am wondering if it is an allergy to something or excema since I have had it in minor spots on my forehead in the past. \n\nAny product advice would be great!! Its really annoying and ugly,, other than vaseline i use the laneige sleep lip mask and my drunk elephant barrier repair cream on the non-lip skin occasionally",
