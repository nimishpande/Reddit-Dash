      "title": "The K18 vs. Olaplex Paper",
      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

NM.\n\ni (28f) generally have problems with acne. i would say my skin is oily/combo and acne prone. i also unfortunately have problems with compulsive skin-picking, which i am always trying to work on but makes any existing acne worse.\n\nmy acne tends to be worse on my jawline and slightly spreading onto my neck - this has been the case for years. but over the past couple of months the entire lower part of my face and my neck have just been getting worse and worse. it actually looks worse irl than in the picture i think - little red spots all around my jaw and chin, then on my neck and under my ears i get really big spots that pop and bleed a lot. obviously again - i tend to pick, it makes everything worse. but i really dont have to do a lot to these to set them off, just absent mindedly brushing my hand over the area i feel like.\n\ni feel like there could be so many reasons why, which is why im so overwhelmed in how to approach the problem.\n\nmy routine is generally like  \nAM - wash face with microfibre cloth and cerave cream cleanser, moisturise with simple light moisturiser, apply beauty of joseon aqua-fresh rice spf.  \nsometimes i put on makeup, or i go to the gym, but not both, and neither every day.  \nPM - heimish cleansing balm if i was wearing makeup, then cerave cream cleanser, then simple light moisturiser, and maybe la roche posay cicaplast baume if im feeling dry. i have a prescription daily doser from skin + me i used to use every day, but im reluctant now as my active acne keeps getting worse. i messaged them saying i was having this issue and the most recent doser they sent me has some other actives as well as tretinoin, but i seriously am not noticing anything helpful, and since my face seems to be exploding and they told me not to apply it to active acne, ive just put it to one side - which hasnt seemed to make a difference.\n\ni also got worried that the cleanser was the problem, so over the past week i was mostly using cotton rounds and garnier micellar water instead. i dont think it made it better or worse though.\n\nthis is a pared-back version of my routine. i do also have a haru haru wonder black rice milky toner i had been using, and a skin1004 tea tree + cica serum thing, and i was using a skin1004 moisturiser - probio cica or something? - but i have not been using them because i wanted to see if it helped as i thought both probiotic stuff and cica stuff can cause problems for some people so wanted to rule that out (again, i havent noticed anything).\n\nnow i just feel totally confused about what to do. dont get me wrong - i appreciate that there are things i should also aim to do better for my skin, eating better, not picking, cleaning pillowcases more often - but i dont know why this would be happening now specifically. ive been trying to ignore it but its getting too horrible.\n\ni feel kind of stupid and embarrassing writing this - this is a throwaway account, but i am a regular and long term member of this sub - i feel like i already know the common sense responses i should get, but im still finding it really hard to navigate somehow, so would appreciate some advice anyway. im probably being stupid about it idk. today i just washed it then covered my whole face in sudocrem (antibacterial zinc oxide cream usually used for babies nappy/diaper rash) because im just at a loss. im not expecting a commenter to be able to come along and tell me what the cause is, but maybe someone can help me take steps to figure it out? i know at the moment im just flip flopping around like a dying fish and its not helpful :')",

      "title": "[Acne] I can't moisturize without breaking out in this humid climate, halp",
      "content": "So I'd probably say after reading up a bit that I have sensitive combination skin. My T zone (especially my nose) is more oily and I pretty much never moisturize my nose. Recently moved to a more humid climate, so my skincare routine has gone out the window pretty much. When I first moved here, I kept on doing my regular routine from my previous climate (cleansing/washing face and body with Dove Sensitive soap, using Olay Complete for face and Jergens Ultra Healing body lotion. Was using Gold Bond Eczema Relief for my hands but the humidity has kinda made my hand eczema go away. Still use it when I do moisturize my body). I quickly realized after breaking out pretty bad that that wasn't gonna fly. I stopped moisturizing entirely pretty much to let the acne dry out and go away. My back also breaks out pretty bad after moisturizing my body.\n\nThis worked, but obviously now my skin is just drier and I don't like that either. When I do moisturize my face I just get under my eyes, maybe my forehead and my beard. Even then, many times I'll break out and thus starts the cycle of me not moisturizing again. I'm at a point where I'm just moisturizing once a week so I'm not constantly broken out, but I pay by having drier skin.\n\nI guess I'm making this post to ask what products specifically I should use. I know I should be looking for non comedogenic facial moisturizers, but anyone have specific products that won't break the bank? Same for body lotion. Jergens Ultra Healing seems to work fine for me, but if there's a better product out there that will leave me just as moisturized without making me break out, that'd obviously be ideal.\n\nDefinitely open to providing more details or DMing for any more context. Thanks for any help/advice!",

      "content": "\nSo I’ve been thinking about this for a while and honestly I don’t get why this isn’t already a thing. We already have tons of biologic drugs that basically work as “sponges” for stuff in the blood. Like monoclonal antibodies that bind PCSK9 for cholesterol or ones that bind TNF-α, IL-6 and whatever for inflammation. That tech already exists and works.\n\nSo the idea is super simple in my head:\njust make a big protein that only sticks to DHT, dump it in the bloodstream, and boom -&gt;&gt; free DHT gets neutralized as it floats around. Meanwhile 5-alpha-reductase is untouched so neurosteroids don’t get nuked like with finasteride/dutasteride. And when you stop taking the drug, the protein levels drop and everything goes back to normal. Seems way cleaner than blocking 5-AR itself.\n\nThere’s even bonus points: big proteins usually don’t cross the blood-brain barrier well, so in theory you’d mostly suppress peripheral DHT (scalp, skin, prostate etc) but maybe leave more brain DHT alone. So possibly less CNS interference than fin/dutasteride. Making something selective with a protein is way easier than with a tiny small molecule that binds everything.\n\nYeah, it would probably have to be an injection and would be stupid expensive cuz biologics always are. And obviously you’d still be suppressing DHT systemically so long-term safety would need studying. But as far as WHAT PHARMA COULD ACTUALLY BUILD in the next 5 years? This seems like the most realistic shot at “DHT suppression without resucing neurosteroids.”\n\nSo… legit question:\nWhy hasn’t anyone made this yet?\n\nIs it just lack of market interest? Technical limitations? Patents? No one’s thought of it? Or is there some huge reason this wouldn’t work that I’m missing?",

      "content": "I wanted to share my experience with Dr.Ko, because reading other people’s reviews helped me a lot when I was still debating what to do.\n\nBefore surgery, my receding hairline was honestly consuming way too much of my mental energy. I was constantly checking mirrors, windows, my phone camera… every photo became a “how bad is it now?” moment. I’d avoid bright lighting and certain angles, and I felt like my hairline was aging me way beyond my actual age.\n\nI finally decided I couldn’t keep living like that and reached out to Dr. Ko. From the first consultation, he was calm, professional, and very honest. He didn’t try to oversell anything or promise some crazy, unrealistic result. Instead, he explained what was actually possible with my donor area, what kind of hairline would look natural for my face, and what the whole process would look like from day 0 to full result. He answered all my questions (and I had a lot), and never made me feel rushed.\n\nOn the surgery day, I was nervous, but his team was organized and kind, and he checked in on me frequently throughout the procedure. The atmosphere was surprisingly relaxed. Any time I felt uncomfortable or had a question, he explained what was happening and what the next step would be. That really helped with my anxiety.\n\nPost-op care was another big plus. I never felt “abandoned” after paying and leaving. He gave clear instructions on washing, sleeping position, meds, swelling, shedding, and what to realistically expect month by month. Whenever I had small worries (redness, itching, etc.), he responded in a very reassuring and detailed way.\n\nNow I’m at the stage where the result is really coming in, and I couldn’t be happier. I don’t obsess over my forehead anymore, I’m not hiding under certain hairstyles, and I actually like how I look in photos again.\n\nI went from constantly stressing about my receded hairline to genuinely loving this new look. I have nothing to worry about now in terms of my hairline, and that mental relief alone has been huge.\n\nIf anyone is on the fence and considering a hair transplant with Dr. Ko, my experience has been extremely positive, both the journey and the result.",

I attached some photos to show my skin and what's going on with it. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fe6v4klfu02g1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7fd9cace5532099b1770aa224a6c75900f6f4ca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgflfklfu02g1.jpg?width=2553&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e611ba350ed47aa41ebbabdc289dd47a6e02b439\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/96bltklfu02g1.jpg?width=3074&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3280d699d0353a1a39557de7fba5175e24bb1a0\n\n",

Ofc I detangle my hair in the shower and I also scrunch it. After that I scrunch it with a cotton shirt. And I apply a good amount of leave in conditioner, then I leave it to air dry, then I apply like 2 drops of rose oil. \n\n2- other days: I wet my hair then I brush it, then I apply the leave in and scrunch it , air dry, oil. \n\nWell I think I do need a mousse or gel or smth .

      "content": "Hi everyone, apologies for the long post but I'm very new to this subreddit as I have recently discovered I have curly hair and have lots of questions. After years of not being able to dry brush and constantly frizzy hair, you can imagine my realization when I find this sub.\n\nAnyway, I read through the 80 page google doc wiki and still have a few confusing questions about curly hair maintenance. For reference, I'm 25m with medium length, fine texture, medium density, high porosity hair. I *think* my hair type is 2C but I'm not 100% sure.\n\n\n\nHere's my current routine before getting into the questions:\n\n1. SHAMPOO: kristen ess clarifying shampoo 1x a month, otherwise shea moisture intensive hydration shampoo 1-2x a week as I feel like I need it\n\n2. CONDITIONER: shea moisture men avocado butter &amp; manuka honey deep conditioner daily. I also co-wash on days I don't shampoo and fully rinse this out. I use a wide tooth comb to brush my hair in the shower.\n\n3. LEAVE-IN: after I get out of the shower, I use about 6-8 sprays emulsified in my hand of shea moisture hydrate + repair multi-action leave-in.\n\n4. CURL CREAM: shea moisture coconut &amp; hibiscus curl &amp; style milk, I put about a penny sized drop into my hand and emulsify before scrunching into my hair\n\n5. OIL: if my hair feels dry or I shampoo'd, I use 2-4 drops of cliganic argan oil. after this I just let it air dry, which usually takes \\~1hr\n\n\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. am I really meant to only \"wash\" my hair every 3-4 days? I go to the gym 4x a week and sweat profusely in the summer, I feel like I absolutely need to shower and at the very least condition my hair daily.\n\n2. the wiki says NEVER brush unless we are applying conditioner in the shower, but then there's a section on brush styling which also confused me. I've been styling my hair with just my hands when scrunching my products in, but once it dries it looks really messy like I just got out of bed. It's sitting the way I want with no crazy flyaways, but it doesnt have a \"clean\" or neat look, I suspect I need to brush but in my experience brushing has always made my hair frizzy in the past when I've used a standard hair brush.\n\n3. the wiki recommends just styling with gel, but there's also a section talking about LOC (or LCO), when are you meant to use which? My guess is that when you're doing a \"refresh\" such as getting ready in the morning you do the LOC method without gel? or is it more of an alternative to using gel instead?",

      "title": "[Acne] RANT about isotretinoin and lack of progress in the acne treatment industry in the past 15 years",
      "content": "Long rant about acne, especially about isotretinoin and public healthcare as I cannot afford going to a private doctor regularly. \n\nFeel FREE to rant yourself in the comments too! About anything even remotely related to acne treatment is fine 👍\n\nTL:DR - I found a thing (small amount of isotretinoin irregularly) that works for me but I cannot use it because the healthcare system is so inflexible and unable to provide any working alternatives. \n\n**MODS I AM NOT BREAKING THE RULES JUST BECAUSE I MENTION MEDICINE AND DIET!! I AM NOT ADVOCATING FOR ANYTHING. I AM RANTING FROM MY OWN ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I AM SO FRUSTRATED AND I DON'T CLAIM THAT THIS IS A MEDICALLY PROVEN METHOD**\n\nI have had acne since teenage, so over 15 years. So I know my skin very well, better than any doctor knows my skin. \n\nI used to have SUPER bad acne as a teen and I got isotretinoin. Isotretinoin worked, but the acne came back. Throughout the years I got isotretinoin many times and it always worked well, but the acne always came back after stopping it.\n\nI tried \"everything\" else throughout the years too and the only things that SLOWED my acne, not stop it, were eating a mainly beef meat based dier and stopping exercise and everything stressful. Definately not worth it, as it helped just a bit and the tradeoff was much more than the reward.\n\nAround four years ago I got an isotretinoin course again, I don't even remember how manieth it was as I have had many in my lifetime. I did it and the acne went away, just like always, but I had gotten enough of the medicines that I had leftovers.\n\nJust from my own intuition, I started doing a thing with the remaining medicine I had never heard of before: I started taking them only infrequently here and there when I felt like my acne would be \"waking\" up.\n\nAnd you know what? It worked. No side effects as I used so little and a few years without acne.\n\nThen the medicine ended maybe 2 years ago. So I go to the doctors again and happily explain that I have finally found a way to keep my skin in good shape and my skin is better than ever and I just need a bit of isotretinoin.\n\nWhat does she answer? She answers:\n\n\"We cannot do that. But we can give you antiobitics/topical treatment/whatever bs I have done 100 times already.\"\n\nI say that okay whatever give me that nonsense, I will try it again and report back. Few months go by and my skin is getting bad again and I am soooo mad. I send a message to them and say I don't care, I want isotretinoin and I don't care if I die from liver failure or whatever, I can sign a waiver, just give me the freaking medicine so I can exercise and live a normal life.\n\nFor me acne is not only a cosmetic problem. I cannot exercise and sleep properly when I really start getting acne, so whatever risk small amounts of isotretinoin has, is easily worth it in my case. \n\nEventually some other doctor calls me and he says he gives me the medicine.\n\nAmazing! A few years go by again and today my skin is in amazing shape! The only time I started getting acne was a few months ago when I tested if I will get acne again when I stop medicine, which I did, and then got my skin in good shape again by taking isotretinoin for two weeks before it got worse. And my liver is in great condition etc. No side effects. Just a few pills here and there. \n\nBut now the medicine is ending! 😠 So I went to a doctor today. And she says: \"We cannot give you the medicine. We can give you antibiotics/topical treatment/whatever bs I have done 100 times already\".\n\nI swear, I almost flipped out. It was the only time I have gotten mad at a doctor. I was able to contain myself because I understand that she is just \"doing her job\" but I nearly flipped out.\n\nI got so furious. How on earth still in 2025 it is impossible for me to take care of my skin when I can literally see what works and since I take it so little it and my bloodwork is perfect.\n\nSo frustrating!!!!!!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡",
