      "content": "I'm surprised I haven't seen much about this paper\n\n[Bleached Hair as Standard Template to Insight the Performance of Commercial Hair Repair Products](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150)\n\nAs far as I know it's the only paper that tests both k18 and Olaplex? Also it's open access so anyone can read it.\n\nThe paper is a little weird though because it tests k18 and Olaplex^(®) N°0 ...which I thought is the primer and the No. 3 is the main treatment?\n\nBasically they bleached a bunch of hair samples that were already bleached, so they were pretty fried.\n\nThey did a bunch of tests to determine how the treatments changed\n\n* The appearance of the hair\n* The appearance of the cuticle\n* The bonds in the hair\n* The hair's resistance to heat (which is often used as a test to see how much a treatment helped the hair's condition)\n* The hair's strength\n\n  \nAs far as I can determine it doesn't seem like they found evidence of \"repaired\" disulfide bonds even though they looked for them? They found there was some other covalent bonds forming though. If you know chemistry really well I'd love to know what you think of the chemical analysis here especially figure 7a. From what I understand it seems like it showed that Olaplex was more like capping the broken ends of the disulfide bonds than actually connecting them back to each other (the claimed cross-linking)?\n\nThis is consistent with the other independent [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279560/) that evaluated bonds after Olaplex treatment. While maybe not as impressive as cross-linking, the capping the broken ends can help stabilize the structure.\n\nAs far as actually improving the condition of the hair:\n\n&gt;Olaplex^(®) showed superior thickness and the highest tensile strength and extensibility ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)C–F), suggesting that the product may play a role in the core of the fiber, thus affecting the intrinsic mechanical properties. In the case of K18^(®,) the pattern was similar ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)B,D–F); however, the effect was less prominent compared to Olaplex^(®). SEM and AFM observations showed that K18^(®) acts at a superficial level without a significant effect on the core of the hair fiber. From [Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E, it is possible to observe that Olaplex^(®) and K18^(®) led to an increase of 47.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the tensile strength in relation to Bleached samples ([Figure 10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/5/150#fig_body_display_cosmetics-11-00150-f010)E).\n\nI'm not sure what to make of this paper. The fact I haven't seen it discussed much makes me a little wary but maybe that's unfair. As Lab Muffin says, just because it's peer reviewed doesn't mean it's good. It would be nice to also compare these \"bond repair\" products with traditional conditioners or regular protein treatments. Looking at the scientific literature it seems that plenty of other treatments ranging from regular[ hydrolyzed keratin](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/5/1182) to [coconut oil](https://journals.lww.com/ijot/fulltext/2022/14040/a_method_to_measure_oil_penetration_into_hair_and.4.aspx) also have shown they improve the surface of the hair, tensile strength, etc.\n\nIt is a good reminder though that neither Olaplex or K18 seem to have proven their products do what they claim to do. Also that they probably do *something* and do that something in a different way.",

Unfortunately for many of us, there have been ~thousands of comments on social media &amp; forums online (I tracked, haha) discussing Creatine &amp; hair loss with the popular opinion trending toward it worsening hair loss. This is odd, because there don't seem to definitive biomolecular reasons this should affect DHT production.\n\nStill, no studies exist that credibly study the relation between both. Which is why, if this gets enough interest, I &amp; some academic friends will be conducting the first large, credible study on Creatine &amp; DHT correlation next month.  \n  \nThis will be a basic 4-week double-blind study where you can take your own Creatine, or a free generic month's worth of supply provided by us. \n\nTo participate, please indicate interest below &amp; we'll get back to you! Why participate? If we can conclusively prove no effect, it'll mean you can get the same or better gains going to the gym much, much faster (22% in modern samples) &amp; maintain markers of brain health.\n\nCreatine is a well-studied, fantastic, beautifully harmless supplement.

      "content": "Hey all, \n\nSearched around this subreddit and online and couldn't find any good examples of this happening with oral minoxidil, but has anybody else gotten facial Pili Multigemini (compound hair growth) from oral minoxidil? I have relatively thick facial hair, and started oral minoxidil roughly a year ago at 2.5mg, once a day.  I haven't noticed these elsewhere on my body, just on my face. \n\n\n\nI used to get these compound hairs once every couple of months, but now I've been finding them after shaving 1-3x per week. They almost always end up becoming ingrown hairs/turning into zits if I don't pluck them, and I've been shaving with a Norelco OneBlade which generally doesn't leave any ingrown hairs/irritate my skin at all. I wash my face with a silicone scrubber in the shower (helps exfoliation), apply moisturizer 1x per day. At night I wash my face and apply 0.5% tretinoin cream 2-3x weekly. I've had this skincare routine for years, so nothing's really changed on that front. \n\n\n\nThese aren't particularly bad or anything, but I'm wondering if anybody has any advice on how to deal with them, or if they've also experienced dealing with these. Overall oral minox has been pretty good for me, I tried finasteride a few years ago, had some bad side effects, but aside from extra body hair/ear hair and these, no negative side effects on minoxidil. \n\n\n\n(Photo taken from elsewhere on Reddit, I never seem to remember to take a photo of these whenever I pull them).

I’ve also stopped self tanning/spray tanning bc honestly I can’t get it right and my hands always turn out orange. Everything kind of came to a head when I got my driver’s license updated today with my new last name and I got my picture taken when I wasn’t expecting to…it’s the worst picture I’ve taken in a while and of course it’s my new license photo, so self esteem is an all time low.

I need to rank for 2 mins because this has been irritating me for YEARS. \n\nI kept buying \"brightening/glow/radiance\" body washes and literally nothing happened. \n\nSmelled nice--&gt;vibes good--&gt;skin??? same dull, same bumpy, same everything. \n\nI thought my body was just built different🙄🙄\n\nTurns out the real problem is: most indian body washes are just fancy-smelling soap water. No actives. No exfoliation, No brightening. Just vibesssss.\n\nSo obsivously they do.....nothing. \n\nAnd here's the plot twist nobody told me:\n\nAHA +Vitamin C body washes actually make sense becuase they're basically giving your body same treatment your face gets- exfoliation+brighteness without those physical hrad scrubs that scratch your soul. \n\nIf you've found an AHA or Vit C bpdy wash that actually did something (bonus points if it's budget-friendly), drop it below.\n\nLet's save each other from spending money on scented disappointment.😭",

I was previously using the Peach and Lily gel cleanser and matcha moisturizer, which I ceased use of in exchange for the Aestura foaming cleanser while I waited for my order from Olive Young to come in.\n\nNaturally, my skin got pretty dry that week, but I didn’t see this level of redness. The two products I got: the BePlain mung bean cleanser and the S: Nature squalane moisturizer. I’ve been eyeing them for some time, so I was elated to finally try them out!\n\nThe first day was fine, but on the second day, after washing my face, I noticed some redness on my cheeks and brows. The third day was when I realized there must be a problem.\n\nTonight, I switched back to the Aestura cleanser, but I still experienced flushing! It calms down within 30 minutes, so I don’t believe the moisturizer is the problem, as I’d expect it to get worse when applied…\n\nCould these cleansers be too harsh for my skin, ultimately damaging my barrier?

I changed birth controls a couple years back, and I haven’t been to grow my hair as long since. It just seems so dry and unhappy. I haven’t had a haircut in about a year, so I’m worried I just need another trim. Sadly there is only one curly hairdresser where I live and she cuts my hair SO short whenever I go to her. \n\nThese photos were taken the day after a wash day after a full day of work. I’d really appreciate any thoughts on what my hair might need. Am I over-moisturizing? Not moisturizing enough? Using too many products? Any and all input is appreciated!!\n\nRoutine:\n- I shampoo with bounce curl gentle clarifying shampoo maybe 1x/week, and the Curlsmith scalp detox line 1x/month\n- I wet and condition my hair pretty much every day, and use random conditioners. Right now I think it’s the unbreakable bonds Ouidad one\n- after rinsing out conditioner flip hair over in the shower and add Ouidad vitacurl styling serum, then moisture lock whipped curls, then brush with a tangle teezer, then add some advanced climate control gel\n- flip my head upright, comb through with my fingers to create curls, flip over one more time, and wrap my hair in a microfiber towel for ~5 min\n- lastly I’ll add some I create hold gel using prayer hands, and sometimes clip my roots for lift \n- I sleep on a satin pillowcase with my hair in 2 loose twists/braids. I add jojoba oil and/or waleda rosemary conditioning oil at the ends of the braids for added moisturization\n- recently started using nutrifol scalp serum at night\n- refresh by mixing some water with I create hold in my hands, then glide it over my hair \n\nI’ve been in a Ouidad phase recently, which definitely has my hair feeling softer and happier. I was using Curlsmith fragrance free before, but the new formulations didn’t work as well for my curls \n",
