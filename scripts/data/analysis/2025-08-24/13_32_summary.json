      "content": "So I had acne issues since class 8-9th and currently I'm 23 yrs old tried almost everything, 2 years back went to a private derma, she suggested black peel and bunch of medicine, every appointment used to cost 6-7k. Though it reduced my acne but didn't improve it. \n\nI also had gut issues from last few years didn't really looked much into that until now, was having severe bloating etc so went to a gastro, he did endoscopy and it came rut+ basically a bacteria was there where it shouldn't be, so he gave bunch of antibiotics and said to reduce oil and masala in home food and stop eating outside food. So I stopped eating outside food and in home ate simple ghar ka kahana and dude in just 1 month my skin was so clear, no pimple no acne, nothingg. It's been more than 3 months and my skin is a lottt better.\n\nSo to test this theory I ate outside food 2 days and in just next 2-3 days I had couple of small acnes. So I've not been able to identify what exactly in outside food is causing this but currently my bet is on maida(refined flour), as it contains gluten and it is inflammatory.\n\nSo bottomline is that guys if you have gut and stomach issues like bloating etc and also have acne then it could be related, so stop having maida (refined flour), rajma, chole, wheat and outside food for a month and see if there's any difference.",
