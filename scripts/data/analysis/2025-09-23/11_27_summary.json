Do I understand correctly that this is *keratosis pilaris*? \n\nI read that glycolic acid might help, so I've been applying it every night for a month now, but I haven't seen noticeable changes. Should I wait for longer or switch to a more serious product? Urea creams, salicylic acid? \n\nOr is it due to genetics and I will never get rid of them? I didn't have them when I was a kid / teenager. \n\nI would be so grateful to hear personal experiences / what products or routines actually helped you clear it up. \n\nThanks",

      "title": "A summary of all current research and opinion on variations in porosity in healthy hair",
      "content": "This is a rabbithole I went down because I made one of the more popular porosity quizzes online and it has normal, low, and high porosity. Then I realized most scientific experts on hair only recognize essentially two porosities: damaged (high) and undamaged (low). Like this on the[ beauty brains blog:](https://thebeautybrains.com/2012/02/how-can-i-test-my-hair-porosity/)\n \n&gt; Porosity is an indicator of how damaged your hair is. The “pores” are really tiny cracks in the protein structure that weaken hair’s natural defenses. Porous hair has increased moisture loss, lower natural lipid content, and is more prone to breakage and split ends.\n\nIt is recognized that in long hair, even if the hair is overall not damaged, the ends are generally higher porosity due to weathering (Nanomechanical characterization of human hair using nanoindentation and SEM. Ultramicroscopy. doi:10.1016/j.ultramic.2005.06.033). So that would greatly simplify my quiz! I'd just ask if your hair was damaged and/or long.\n\nBut that does leave a conundrum which is that people have reported variations in porosity in healthy hair, and even scientists have written about the phenomenon\n\n- Dr. Ali Syed, a cosmetic chemist, in non published research (at least I can't find it) [presented at a conference](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/news/event-coverage/news/21952761/society-of-cosmetic-chemists-scc-meeting-dives-into-industry-diversity-with-curly-hair-research-and-the-rd-approach) said his team found \"An increase in fiber porosity was observed as the hair fiber increased in degree of curl.\"\n- Dr. Crystal Porter, a hair scientist, [in an interview with the Ecowell podcast](https://www.theecowell.com/podcast/crystal) said porosity increases with increased curl (thanks to /u/veglove for telling me about this)\n- Dr. Trefor Evans [speculated that differences in porosity could account the phenomenon that some hair seems resistant to treatments like perms](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/testing/efficacy/article/21836483/modifying-hairs-structure-from-the-inside)\n- The one exception to the curly = lower porosity, Dr. Michelle Gaines, a physicist who studies hair, said curly hair was [lower porosity in an interview](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/65)\n\nBut what Dr. Gaines says afterwards perhaps hints at the complexity of the issue: \"kinkier hair has a harder time \nbecoming saturated with water.\"\n\n## The studies\n\nI started reading papers that studied the permeability of hair to water vapor, and it turns out that there is variation in different hair samples, but it can differ between\n- absorption: absorbing water\n- desorption: releasing water\n\nThe speed of these processes can be expressed by measurements like diffusion velocity (roughly how fast the process happens, like how fast it absorbs water). If I'm wrong about this LMK because this stuff is very specialized and I'm not a physicist or chemist. Also keep in mind that ALL this research is done in relation to water in the air (humidity), not liquid water or products.\n\nIncidentally this is also an example of where it's hard to search the scientific literature or ask AI LLMs like ChatGPT, because most of these papers talk about permeability and diffusion rather than using \"porosity\".\n\nThe main papers on this are from a group in Spain studying lipids in the hair, which they theorize is related to permeability. Three of the papers compare ethnic differences, with samples labeled African, Caucasian, and Asian. Now I'm sure your spidey senses are tingling thinking of all the problems with this, but we'll get to this later.\n\n- The influence of hair lipids in ethnic hair properties\n- Lipid distribution on ethnic hairs by Fourier transform infrared synchrotron spectroscopy\n- Ethnic hair: Thermoanalytical and spectroscopic differences\n\nIn general they found African hair was the most permeable, Asian hair had some differences in Caucasian hair related to how it reacted to humidity changes, but the differences in velocity in those two groups was not statistically significant.\n\nThe last paper from this group is [Lipid loses and barrier function modifications of the brown-to- white hair transition](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30758871/) compared two colors of Caucasian hair: brown and white (greying hair, not people born with white hair). It found that the white hair was higher porosity. I did not find in the paper any mention of statistical significance though.\n\nFinally there is a recent paper from a team I think at the L'Oreal labs [Role of Lipids in Water Permeation of Different Curl Pattern Hair Types ](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/12/5/193). If you only want to read one of these papers, this is the easiest to read IMHO and it's open access. \n\nL'Oreal has its own system of curl typing with type 1 being completely straight. The samples here were\n- Caucasian type 3 hair from 3 individuals\n- Asian type 2 hair  from 3 individuals\n\nThey found statistically significant differences, with the Asian hair having lower water absorption at all humidities. But then it gets complicated: the Caucasian hair had higher diffusion at low humidities, and lower at high humidities. The Asian samples were the opposite. So basically even if porosity are real, they would be more complicated then just \"normal\" and \"low\" porosity. They would be related to other factors like humidity, and potentially be different between absorption and desorption. \n\n## Expert analysis of the studies\nNow the Spanish studies have many flaws, which are pointed out by Dr. Elsabe Cloete and her team in South Africa in probably the most readable paper I'm going to mention (+open access): [The what, why and how of curly hair: a review](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2019.0516)\n\n&gt; A group of Spanish researchers investigating lipid contents in various hair types [18,40,102] has reported (among many findings) that African hair has the greatest amount of exogenous lipids with lower permeability than European and Asian hair. It was shown that, after depletion of exogenous lipids, absorption kinetics remained constant, but desorption kinetics changed, leading to a loss of total moisture content. On the other hand, depletion of endogenous lipids promoted lower water permeability. The European and Asian hair used in the mentioned Spanish studies [18,40,102] appears to be straight, or almost straight. Furthermore, fibres were acquired commercially, and there is no indication of the size of the donor sample pools from the reported literature. It is therefore impossible to determine whether these important findings are generally true for specific racial groups, or whether they are phenotypical. A recent study [105] by the same group, where different colour hair from the same racial group was subjected to similar investigations, seems to point to a phenotypical rather than racial origin. Results showed a significant difference in cuticle lipid content, as well as different absorption/desorption dynamics between the white and brown hair. White fibres exhibited decreased absorption capacity and increased rate of permeability. This raises a question about how these observations would differ between fibres of different curliness in the same population. Considering that certain fibre features, previously attributed to race, were later found to be attributable to fibre shape, there is a strong likelihood that lipid distribution may have a phenotypical, rather than racial, nature. If true, it would not be irrational to suggest dissimilarities in biochemical environment (among curly and non-curly fibres) that would affect absorption. \n\nBasically:\n* We don’t really know enough about where the hair samples came from\n* The only curly hair tested was African hair\n* In the past, some things people thought were about race actually turned out to just be about curliness\n* So it might not be “African hair = more permeable,” but instead “curly hair = more permeable”\n\n## Conclusion\nSo to conclude there is some evidence of porosity variation in healthy human hair, but the significance and cause is yet unknown and is likely different in different contexts like different humidities or releasing vs. absorbing water. It may be related to ethnicity and hair color (grey/white hair specifically). But overall there just aren't a lot of studies on the subject and the ones we have are pretty limited.\n\nTri-Princeton research institute has some industry research in their library but it's not accessible to me (I have University access but their access is limited to mostly cosmetics and chemical companies). I would love to get access to their stuff and applied for a paid individual membership but it hasn't been approved and I'm not sure it will be since I'm just a rando.\n\nIf any of you have any thoughts or corrections I'd love to here them!\n",

While they don't look exactly the same, they are also clear and small, and I'm wondering if I somehow spread what I have on my hands to my face.
