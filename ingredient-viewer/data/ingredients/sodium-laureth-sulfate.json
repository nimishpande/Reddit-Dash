    "description": "Sodium Laureth Sulphate (SLES) is an anionic surfactant used in cosmetics for its detergent properties. It is therefore very present in shower gels and shampoos. It is produced from Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) by ethoxylation, a very polluting chemical transformation, which is why it is prohibited in organic products. Sodium Laureth Sulphate is reputed to be less irritating than Sodium Lauryl Sulphate although the latter is more natural and authorized in Organic, it is the chemical transformation that has softened it and increased its foaming power."
