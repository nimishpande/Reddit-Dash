    "description": "Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine is a cationic surfactant used as a substitute for silicones in hair care products. It combines quite easily with the hair (negatively charged) to form a smooth film, but while not occlusive as a silicone. It adheres to the fabric surface to reduce static electricity present. It is a hair conditioner that becomes quaternary ammonium in acidic medium. Given its unecological manufacturing process, the ingredient is not authorized in France but in Germany Yes (BDIH)."
