    "description": "Phenoxyethanol is a synthetic preservative known by the acronym of EGPhE, widely used in cosmetics and increasingly controversial. Since 2012, the ANSM (National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products) has recommended that this preservative not be used in cosmetic products intended for babies' seats and that its maximum content be set at 0.4% for other products for children under 3 years old. It also denounces its liver toxicity, its potentially harmful effects on reproduction as well as many other inconveniences: the conclusions of the 2012 ANSM report are alarming."
