    "description": "Dimethicone also called PDMS is a silicone that is not subject to any European restrictions. It is also the most used silicone in cosmetics. Its role is to produce a film of surface around the hair and on the skin, to protect them then (occlusive effect, with what that can imply). It also brings sweetness to the products and makes it easy to use creams and shampoos. It is a little \"the Swiss knife of the chemist\": it is used a little in all sauces, to make the products brighter, more pleasant and therefore more sellers, or to compensate for the drying effect of certain ingredients like surfactants."
