The fruit of the plant, also called an avocado (or avocado pear or alligator pear), is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed.Avocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and Mediterranean climates throughout the world. They have a green-skinned, fleshy body that may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped, or spherical. Commercially, they ripen after harvesting. Avocado trees are partially self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain  predictable fruit quality and quantity. In 2017, Mexico produced 34% of the world supply of avocados.",

        "description": "Camellia oleifera, which originated in China, is notable as an important source of edible oil (known as tea oil or camellia oil) obtained from its seeds. It is commonly known as the oil-seed camellia or tea oil camellia, though to a lesser extent other species of camellia are used in oil production too.\nIt is widely distributed in China and is cultivated extensively there. It is found in forests, thickets, banks of streams and foothills at elevations of 500 to 1,300 metres.This species looks much similar to Camellia sasanqua except the dark green, evergreen leaves are a bit larger, three to five inches long and two to three inches wide. Single, white, fragrant flowers are produced in mid to late fall, and this large shrub or small tree will reach a height of 20 feet with thin, upright, multiple trunks and branches.\nThe crown forms a rounded or oval vase with lower branches removed.",

Sodium Laureth Sulphate is reputed to be less irritating than Sodium Lauryl Sulphate although the latter is more natural and authorized in Organic, it is the chemical transformation that has softened it and increased its foaming power.\n\nThis ingredient is classified as ecotoxic according to REACH (Aquatic Chronic 3).",

        "description": "Panthenol is an alcohol widely used in cosmetics. This active ingredient goes into the formulation of shampoos and conditioners to make hair shiny and supple. Panthenol improves hydration, reduces itching and inflammation of the skin. It accelerates and improves the healing of epidermal wounds. It is often used in sunburn treatment products. When panthenol is applied topically, it penetrates the lower layers of the skin, is absorbed by skin cells and converted to pantothenic acid (more commonly known as vitamin B5). It is this penetration that allows essential hydration.\r\nThe ingredient does not exist in its natural state in this form is prohibited in Bio, it's a shame!\r\n\r\nIn a study published in December 2017, the CIR concluded that panthenol poses no health risk in cosmetics. However, other studies report contact irritations and allergies, but in much larger doses than those used in cosmetics.",

Giant kelp is common along the coast of the eastern Pacific Ocean, from Baja California north to southeast Alaska, and is also found in the southern oceans near South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Individual algae may grow to more than 45 metres (150 feet) long at a rate of as much as 60 cm (2 ft) per day. Giant kelp grows in dense stands known as kelp forests, which are home to many marine animals that depend on the algae for food or shelter. The primary commercial product obtained from giant kelp is alginate, but humans also harvest this species on a limited basis for use directly as food, as it is rich in iodine, potassium, and other minerals. It can be used in cooking in many of the ways other sea vegetables are used, and particularly serves to add flavor to bean dishes.",

It predominantly grows on the lower shore, especially where fucoid algae are absent, but is also found further up shore on exposed coasts.\nIt forms calcium carbonate deposits within its cells which serve to strengthen the thallus. These white deposits cause the seaweed to appear pink in colour, with white patches where the calcium carbonate is particularly concentrated, such as at the growing tips. The calcium carbonate makes it unpalatable to most rocky shore grazers.",

        "description": "Laverbread () is a food product, made from an edible seaweed (littoral alga), consumed mainly in Wales as part of local traditional cuisine. The seaweed is commonly found around the west coast of Great Britain and east coast of Ireland along the Irish Sea, where it is known as slake. It is smooth in texture and forms delicate, sheetlike thalli, often clinging to rocks. The principal variety is Porphyra umbilicalis. Porphyra (laver seaweed) is classified as red algae; it tends to be a brownish colour, but boils down to a dark green pulp when prepared. Laver seaweed has a high content of dietary minerals, particularly iodine and iron. The high iodine content gives the seaweed a distinctive flavour in common with olives and oysters. \nLaver seaweed has been cultivated as a food since at least the 17th century. It is prepared by washing repeatedly and then boiled until it becomes a soft mush when it is known as laverbread. The gelatinous paste that results can then be sold as it is, or rolled in oatmeal; it is sometimes coated with oatmeal prior to frying. Laverbread is traditionally eaten fried with bacon and cockles as part of a Welsh breakfast, or with hog's pudding in the south west of England.",

In cosmetics, it is used as humectant and in toothpastes one appreciates its sweet taste. The ingredient is not cariogenic (caries generator, as can sugar). Xylitol also has a very low glycemic index which makes it a major asset against hyperglycemia, for example. It is used in food under the name E967.\r\n\r\nStudies have also shown that used over a long period, it can have an anti caries incidence, increasing salivary flow and pH while reducing the number of cariogenic bacteria and periodontopathogens.",

Panthenol improves hydration, reduces itching and inflammation of the skin. It accelerates and improves the healing of epidermal wounds. It is often used in sunburn treatment products. When panthenol is applied topically, it penetrates the lower layers of the skin, is absorbed by skin cells and converted to pantothenic acid (more commonly known as vitamin B5). It is this penetration that allows essential hydration.\r\nThe ingredient does not exist in its natural state in this form is prohibited in Bio, it's a shame!\r\n\r\nIn a study published in December 2017, the CIR concluded that panthenol poses no health risk in cosmetics. However, other studies report contact irritations and allergies, but in much larger doses than those used in cosmetics.",

This protein used in cosmetics is of animal origin and comes mostly from sheep wool (New Zealand is one of the largest producers). The plant version of keratin is called Phytokeratin and is better known in the INCI list under the term: \"HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN\".\r\n\r\nIn cosmetics, keratin is used to smooth and moisturize the cuticle of damaged hair. It fills cracks and eliminates frizz related to drying.",

It is often used in conjunction with CAPB.\nSLMI is produced by ethoxylation, which makes it an environmentally unfriendly ingredient. It is prohibited in the COSMOS specifications.",

        "description": "Dimethiconol is known to create a subtle shine, smooth and silky to the touch. It gives a \"bounced\" appearance to the skin temporarily, which allows it to fill imperfections and small wrinkles. Compared to other silicones, it is known to have a fluid texture and less oily, which facilitates its spread on the skin. Dimethiconol does not pose a health problem: the CIR has given it a score of 1 in 10 in terms of risk (1 representing the best of the ratings). Dimethethiconol is a large molecule that does not penetrate the skin, and is often used with Cyclopentasiloxane for better diffusion. Like all silicones, it is not very biodegradable. It is forbidden in organic.",

Its main property is to complex heavy metals. That is to say, it will somehow neutralize them by forming with them a complex, then serve them as carriers and evacuate them. It is therefore quite logically used in medicine to fight against heavy metal poisoning (lead for example).\r\nIt is often used as a sequestrant (calcium, limestone ...) in soaps or shower gels, this allows to manage the \"hard\" water.\r\n\r\nThe ingredient does not pose a problem for human health but its impact on the environment is disastrous: it is not biodegradable and is extremely harmful to nature. The sewage treatment plants do not hold him back and let him run into our rivers! Charcoal filters in our drinking water are not more effective at stopping it (so we are re-treating EDTA / Iron complexes). The problem is finally that he carries with him heavy metals, whose final destination is unknown.\r\n\r\nEDTA and its salts are banned in organic.",

The plant species is known only as a cultivated plant, and appears to have been domesticated just once from the wild species Linum bienne, called pale flax.",

This sunflower species is also used as wild bird food, as livestock forage (as a meal or a silage plant), in some industrial applications, and as an ornamental in domestic gardens. The plant was first domesticated in the Americas. Wild Helianthus annuus is a widely branched annual plant with many flower heads. The domestic sunflower, however, often possesses only a single large inflorescence (flower head) atop an unbranched stem. The name sunflower may derive from the flower's head's shape, which resembles the sun, or from the impression that the blooming plant appears to slowly turn its flower towards the sun as the latter moves across the sky on a daily basis.\nSunflower seeds were brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, where, along with sunflower oil, they became a widespread cooking ingredient.",

        "description": "Sodium Lauryl sulfate is a surfactant widely used in cosmetics. It is produced mostly from palm oil. It has a very strong foaming and detergent power, but it is criticized for its very irritating and drying effect on the skin, so much so that it is found less and less often in shower gels and bath products. Manufacturers prefer to use the ethoxylated version (SLES = Sodium Laureth Sulfate) less abrasive or other softer surfactants. However, it remains very present in toothpastes for adults (57% contain it) and children (42%).\r\nSLS is also criticized for being a pollutant for the environment, animals, aquatic environments or even plants. Nevertheless, it is authorized in organic.\r\n\r\nIt is classified according to REACH: Ecotoxic (Aquatic Chronic 3).",

It is therefore quite logically used in medicine to fight against heavy metal poisoning (lead for example).\r\nIt is often used as a sequestrant (calcium, limestone ...) in soaps or shower gels, this allows to manage the \"hard\" water.\r\n\r\nThe ingredient does not pose a problem for human health but its impact on the environment is disastrous: it is not biodegradable and is extremely harmful to nature. The sewage treatment plants do not hold him back and let him run into our rivers! Charcoal filters in our drinking water are not more effective at stopping it (so we are re-treating EDTA / Iron complexes). The problem is finally that he carries with him heavy metals, whose final destination is unknown.\r\n\r\nEDTA and its salts are banned in organic.",

It does not accumulate on hair or skin and allows consumers to benefit from the advantage of this family without its disadvantages: soft, non-greasy feel and lubricating properties.\nNevertheless, it has been closely monitored for several years and its release into nature remains a concern. D5 is classified as vPvB (very persistent and very bioaccumulative). The risk to the environment arises from its presence in certain cosmetic products rinsed with water: from January 31, 2020, the maximum content of D5 will be set at 0.1% in cosmetic products rinsed with water, which in fact prohibits its use, since in such concentrations it will no longer be of any interest.

        "description": "Sodium hyaluronate is the salt of hyaluronic acid. This active ingredient is appreciated for its moisturizing and plumping effect on the skin. It is a natural component of the connective tissue. It easily penetrates the epidermis and is then able to fix a large amount of water, up to 20 times its weight. For this reason, it is found in many cosmetics such as anti-aging, moisturizing creams or even foundations ...\r\n\r\nDiscovered in the 1930s, hyaluronic acid is abundant in the dermis of young skin, but its quantity decreases with age: the skin appears more damaged, with wrinkles. Hyaluronic acid is a fairly large molecule that has difficulty penetrating the skin, and is much more effective injection. In a cosmetic, it is its salt that is used: sodium hyaluronate is a much smaller molecule, which penetrates more easily and can then move into the deep layers of the skin.\r\n\r\nThis salt is a powerful humectant that attracts and holds water to it, making it the moisturizer of choice for the skin: it helps keep it \"wet\". As it attracts and binds to the water, it causes a slight swelling which reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles, to give the skin a younger appearance.\r\nIt is authorized in Bio.",

Vegetable squalane, which is sometimes called phytosqualane, generally comes from the unsaponifiable part of olive oil.\nControversies exist about it when it is of animal origin and extracted from shark liver: the shark is killed, its viscera are extracted and it is thrown back into the sea.\nWe hope that these practices are less and less common: make sure that the one used in your product is of plant origin. If it's not clear, call the brand to confirm. Squalane is produced by hydrogenation of squalene.",

        "description": "Dimethicone also called PDMS is a silicone that is not subject to any European restrictions. It is also the most used silicone in cosmetics. Its role is to produce a film of surface around the hair and on the skin, to protect them then (occlusive effect, with what that can imply). It also brings sweetness to the products and makes it easy to use creams and shampoos. It is a little \"the Swiss knife of the chemist\": it is used a little in all sauces, to make the products brighter, more pleasant and therefore more sellers, or to compensate for the drying effect of certain ingredients like surfactants.\r\n\r\nThis inert component poses no problem for human health, one can only wonder if its effect is not only marketing and artificial. It is on the ecological aspect that the ingredient can have a very negative impact since it is very little biodegradable.",

As intact arils or juice, pomegranates are used in baking, cooking, juice blends, meal garnishes, smoothies, and alcoholic beverages, such as cocktails and wine.\n\nThe pomegranate originated in the region extending from modern-day Iran to northern India, and has been cultivated since ancient times throughout the Mediterranean region. It was introduced into Spanish America in the late 16th century and into California by Spanish settlers in 1769.Today, it is widely cultivated throughout the Middle East and Caucasus region, north and tropical Africa, South Asia, Central Asia, the drier parts of southeast Asia, and parts of the Mediterranean Basin. It is also cultivated in parts of Arizona and California. In the 20th and 21st centuries, it has become more common in the shops and markets of Europe and the Western Hemisphere.",

        "description": "The onion (Allium cepa L., from Latin cepa \"onion\"), also known as the bulb onion or common onion, is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium. Its close relatives include the garlic, shallot, leek, chive, and Chinese onion.This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food, such as the Japanese bunching onion (Allium fistulosum), the tree onion (A. ×proliferum), and the Canada onion (Allium canadense). The name \"wild onion\" is applied to a number of Allium species, but A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation. Its ancestral wild original form is not known, although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions. The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant, but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season.\nThe onion plant has a fan of hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are composed of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm, and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of A. cepa, such as shallots and potato onions, produce multiple bulbs.\nOnions are cultivated and used around the world. As a food item, they are usually served cooked, as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish, but can also be eaten raw or used to make pickles or chutneys. They are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which irritate the eyes.",

It is used in cosmetics as a preservative, hair conditioner or for its smoothing and regenerating effects.

Products to be sprayed that could result in exposure of the consumer's lung by inhalation are also excluded\". Salicylic acid is allowed in Organic.\n\nSalicylic acid is classified CMR category 2: Suspected CMR effect, but insufficient information is available.\n\n* CMR means Carcinogenic, Mutagenic and Reprotoxic",
